TO JOHN ELLIOT CAIRNES1

Jan. 5. 1865

Dear Sir

I have been too long in acknowledging the receipt of the very
interesting things you last sent; but I was working against time on
another subject, and had unwillingly to put by your last notes unread
until this morning. I thank you most heartily for them. They are a
complete Essay on the state and prospects of Ireland,2 and are so
entirely satisfactory that they leave me nothing to think of except how
to make the most use of them. For my new edition I must confine myself
chiefly to the general results; but if I find it advantageous to
transcribe certain paragraphs entire, will you allow me to name their
real author?3 The article is a valuable supplement to the notes. The
letter in the Gardener’s Chronicle4 I was already acquainted with,
having read it in I forget what newspaper. I beg you to offer my sincere
thanks to Mr Pim5 for the books he so kindly sent, which I shall
immediately read. His letter, inclosed in yours, is full of good sense.

Respecting the rate of profits in the United States, we must hope to
learn something through the kind offices of Mr Moran.6 But it is, I
imagine, very difficult to ascertain the real average rate of profit, or
expectation of profit, in any country. It would, however, be something
to have an answer to the Edition: current; Page: [986] more vague
question, whether, in the opinion of Mr Ashworth,7 or other persons to
whom business in both countries is familiar, the profits of capital in
the United States are or are not, higher than in England.

Of the two or three points which we differ about, I will only touch upon
one—the influence of price on demand. You say, if a tax is taken off
beer and laid on tobacco in such a manner that the consumer can still,
at the same total cost as before, purchase his usual quantity of both,
his tastes being supposed unaltered, he will do so. Does not this assume
that his taste for each is a fixed quantity? or at all events that his
comparative desire for the two is not affected by their comparative
prices. But I apprehend the case to be otherwise. Very often the
consumer cannot afford to have as much as he would like of either: and
if so, the ratio in which he will share his demand between the two may
depend very much on their price. If beer grows cheaper and tobacco
dearer, he will be able to increase his beer more, by a smaller
sacrifice of his tobacco, than he could have done at the previous
prices: and in such circumstances it is surely probable that some will
do so. His apportionment of self-denial between his two tastes is likely
to be modified, when the obstacle that confined them is in the one case
brought nearer, in the other thrown farther off.

Now as to the Reader.8 I consented to become a shareholder with the full
intention of sending occasional contributions (to which I should be
quite willing to put my initials) in case I was satisfied with the
editorial arrangements, which I should be, in a very high degree, with
regard to any part of them which you might undertake. My satisfaction
would be much increased if you were willing, as Mr Spencer wished and
hoped, to undertake not merely the political economy department, but
political philosophy generally. I could be more useful to the Reader on
other branches of that subject than on political economy, on which you
would seldom need any hand but your own, and could easily obtain other
aid if you accidentally required it. I might give some help too in moral
and metaphysical philosophy, but that department will probably be under
Spencer’s superintendance, and he and I should, I dare say, often
differ. I have heard nothing further of their plans since the first
communication made to me. Perhaps they may like to try their wings a
little before attempting the higher flight which we have advised, but
for which they are not strong enough at present, if the number for
December 31 (which as it has been sent to me, I suppose came out under
the new management) is a sample of what they can do. When you are fixed
in London and ready to take an active part, we shall be likely to have
more influence on their proceedings.

Edition: current; Page: [987]
I take Macmillan, and was much interested by your article,9 which makes
more distinct the idea I already had of the contract system in the
mining districts. Laing, in his Prize Essay,10 brought it forward many
years ago as an example of the cooperative principle.

I was glad to see Mr Brace’s letter in the Daily News.11 I have had a
visit here from a rather remarkable American, Mr Hazard,12 of Peacetown,
Rhode Island. Do you know him, or his writings? If not, I shall have a
good deal to tell you about him that will interest you.

Sir

Your letter and its inclosures have been forwarded to me here. I am glad
of the appointment of a Commission to enquire into the effects of
capital punishment.2 I confess, however, that I have a very strong
opinion against its total abolition, being persuaded that the liability
to it (whatever may be the case with the sight of it) has a greater
deterring effect, at a less expense of real suffering, than any other
penalty which would be adequate to the worst kind of offences. If
examined, therefore, I should not be a witness on the “right side.” I am

TO AUGUSTUS DE MORGAN1

Jan. 22. 1865

Dear Sir

I have been so much occupied with pressing work, that I have only quite
recently had time to go through the “Double Algebra.”2 I have found it
everything that from what I already knew of your speculations I expected
it to be. Either you are the first (not excepting Peacock)3 who has
pointed out the true rationale of algebra as an universal calculus, or I
was not capable formerly of understanding the true theory when I had it
before me, and have become capable now. Which of these suppositions is
the true one, you best know. The fact in regard to myself is, that
everything which I had a glimmering of, I now seem to myself to see as
clear as day, while you have also led me into regions of which I had not
even a glimmering, and have shewn me how I may have an equally clear
comprehension of the whole of these by taking sufficient pains to follow
you through the details.

Why is what you have done, not known and recognized as the great
contribution to philosophy which it is? I suppose because so few
mathematicians are psychologists, and so few psychologists are
mathematicians. I take blame to myself for not having known your
speculations two years ago, as I might have been helping to spread the
knowledge of them. I am

Dear Sir

I have delayed answering your last letter, until I could at the same
time inform you of my return here.

The Political Economy2 has gone to press, considerably improved as I
think, and indebted to you for much of the improvement. I have availed
myself of your permission to acknowledge this in the preface,3 and also
in the chapter on the Irish question,4 a good deal of which I have given
in inverted commas as a communication from you. I have endeavoured to
correct the effect of the passage which has been used by Australian
protectionists, not by omitting it, but by giving a fuller expression of
my meaning.5 The subject of an Index I had thought of, but most Indexes
of philosophical treatises are so badly and stupidly done, that unless I
could have made it myself or got it made by a political economist, I
thought it better let alone. An index is less wanted for a systematic
treatise than for a book of a miscellaneous character, as the general
arrangement of topics, aided by the analytical table of contents, shews
where to find the things most likely to be wanted.

Edition: current; Page: [990]
I hope that the Reader is not tied to its present editor or sub editor,6
and that all its arrangements are at present only provisional. He goes
out of his way to say the most abominable things about America, and in
other respects he seems to me to do his business carelessly and ill.

I look forward to the pleasure of seeing you soon in England, and, as I
am glad to think, permanently established there.

expected, be considerably shorter than the first.2

I should feel obliged if you would kindly have twenty separate copies

Club.

Edition: current; Page: [991]
You will be glad to read the inclosed, which please return, as I have
not answered it. When is your new edition likely to be ready?2

I have been struck, though not disappointed, by the extreme narrowness
of mind shewn by the Radical members of parliament in all their recent
addresses. There would be more chance, I think, of being listened to, on
such subjects as representation of minorities, by the working classes
themselves, than by their well dressed friends, who are afraid to
concede anything, or admit any fault or danger on the democratic side.
But it is a real disappointment to find the Daily News as bad on these
subjects as if the editor3 were looking out for a seat in parliament.

Lord Amberley’s speech4 is the only one of any promise. He has brains,
and is in earnest, and as he is sure of influence, good is likely to
come of him.

dinner with us on Friday at six?

I have been so busy with other subjects that I have not yet been able to
read your book on the Will.2 I preferred not to touch it until I could
give consecutive attention to it. I have read the greater part of your
Essay on Language3 of which the purely metaphysical part pleased me
much. The Edition: current; Page: [992] speculations respecting a future
state seemed to me to have an imaginative rather than a philosophic
interest.

I hope my publishers have complied with my directions to send to you,

Feb. 9. 1865

Dear Sir

The delay in acknowledging your kind and interesting letter of Nov. 10
was occasioned by my absence from England, which had prevented me from
receiving the sheets of the Christian Examiner which you so obligingly
sent. One of the first things I did after my return here was to read
them. The paper on Inspiration2 interested me as an exposition of a
particular line of thought, but, as you would naturally expect from the
nature of my psychological opinions, it did not carry me with it. The
political articles I was, as I expected to be, much pleased with; and it
gave me great pleasure that you should have thought my miscellaneous
essays worthy of so highly complimentary a judgment.3 The article
‘Democracy on Trial’4 I am almost certain that I received, and quite
certain that if I received it I read it, and thought highly of it,
having always done so of everything political which I have read in the
“Examiner”. In the third edition of my “Representative Government” just
published, I have corrected the omission to notice the democratic
municipal system of the New England States.5

It is almost superfluous now, to congratulate you on the progress of
events. A triumphant end of the war seems not only certain but as near
at Edition: current; Page: [993] hand as is perhaps consistent with that
complete regeneration of the political feeling and thought of the
country, to which I have always looked forward as its result. The
present attitude of the Free States with respect to slavery was worth
buying at even a greater price than has been paid for it; since it is
the removal not only of a stain but of a moral incubus, and is likely to
be the starting point of a moral progress not inferior to the prodigious
material expansion which will be hereafter dated from the annihilation
of negro slavery. I am Dear Sir

Feb. 9. 1865

Dear Sir

As you supposed, your letter of Jan. 24 had not reached me when I last
wrote to you, but it has been sent from Avignon since. I am much obliged
to you for the trouble you have taken to get information respecting the
rate of profit in the U. States, but I fear it is next to impossible to
obtain any conclusive evidence on the subject. There is no more
difficult point to ascertain in the whole field of statistics. The
scientific question remains as great a puzzle to me as ever. Hitherto I
have left the passage of my Pol. Economy exactly as it was; but I shall
have to alter it more or less in the proof sheet.2

I may perhaps get some light on the subject from Mr Hazard, (himself a
New England manufacturer of great experience) whom I shall see tomorrow.
I wish you had been already here, that I might have asked you to meet
him. He leaves for America on the 25th.

Respecting the cost of transferring land in France I can speak from my
own experience. The mere law expenses are very trifling. The only
important expense is the tax, i.e. the duty on reggistration, which is
at present somewhere about 7½ per cent, but this includes a
décime-de-guerre, and the whole or half of another—which do not profess
to be permanent, though there is considerable danger that one of them at
least will become so. The second décime is that which Louis Napoleon
made a demonstration of taking off on the Edition: current; Page: [994]
termination as he thought, or pretended to think, of the Mexican war.3
The upshot was the taking off of half of it only, but whether
immediately or prospectively, and whether the reduction has yet taken
effect, I cannot say.

The notary’s charge for the contract is 1 per cent.

I am delighted that you now agree with me on the question of American
separation. Dr Brown Séquard’s opinions4 do not surprise me, both
because the scientific class have been very generally on the right side
of the American question, and because the actual sight of America
generally corrects prejudices which 19 times out of 20 are the effect of
pure ignorance. It is such things as this which gauge the depth of
British ignorance on all matters whatever outside of this island. What
wonder that people are ignorant of America, when they are equally
ignorant, & equally ignorant of their ignorance, as to Ireland? I agree
with you in thinking Goldwin Smith entirely wrong in the object of his
last two letters.5

The last number of the Reader is a little better. Since you have begun
to write in it,6 the political writing will improve.

I look forward with great interest to what you are now writing about
Ireland.

In haste

I return the Lancet2 with many thanks. This additional instance of the
value of your discovery must be highly gratifying to you.

I have put into the first page of the second article on Comte a sentence
respecting Mr Bridges’ translation, but without including it in the list
at the head of the article, which is confined to original works.3 I see
no reason against its being noticed in the small print at the end of the
Review.4 You will have my second article by that time, and will be able
to avoid as far as necessary any inconsistency between that and the
notice. The Discours Préliminaire which Mr Bridges has translated, gives
the pith of Comte’s later speculations free from some of their grosser
absurdities, and in a form better adapted than any other of his later
works for the information and edification of English readers.

I am quite satisfied with as much of your proposal as relates to the
8000 copies;2 but when we talked together on the subject I understood
Edition: current; Page: [997] that a period was to be fixed after which
the plates would revert to me. Nothing was said about destroying them; &
were I to agree to that part of your proposal I shd be no longer a free
agent, unless under the condition of making new plates, the cost & risk
of which it would require another 8000 copies to remunerate. I would
suggest in preference, that if after the first 8000 are sold the demand
should still continue, we should for a further period (to be now fixed)3
go on at half profit & that on the expiration of this further term
(whether determined by years or by number of copies) the plates shd be
at my disposal.

Feb. 15. 1865

Dear Sir—

It is pleasant to hear from you again. Your letters, besides being
interesting on your own account, almost always contain some valuable
piece of intelligence. What you tell me of the progress of Mr Hare’s
system among the working classes of Manchester is preeminently so. I
know very well to whose indefatigable exertions it is owing. But it
confirms me in the opinion that the working classes will see the true
character & the importance of Mr Hare’s principle much sooner than their
Parliamentary allies. The speeches made by these to their constituents
lately have very much disgusted me. The proverb “il vaut mieux avoir
affaire à Dieu qu’à ses saints” is true of the demagogues & the Demos.
The demagogues never dare admit anything which implies a doubt of the
infallibility of the majority. The Demos itself makes no such
pretensions & can see the utility of taking precautions against its own
mistakes. I shall make use of your letter to convince some of the
dress-coated democrats that there is no need to be “plus royalistes que
le roi.”

With regard to the other subject of your letter; I quite agree with you
that no Reform Bill which we are likely to see for some time to come,
will be worth moving hand or foot for. But with respect to the manhood
suffrage Edition: current; Page: [998] movement, & the question of my
taking part in it, I have long since determined that I would on no
account whatever aid any attempt to make the suffrage universal to men,
unless the inclusion of women were distinctly & openly proclaimed as a
substantive part of the design. There are only two things worth working
for—a practical result or a principle: if a practical result it shd be
one which is attainable; if a principle, not to go the whole length of
it is to sacrifice it. I look upon agitation for manhood as
distinguished from universal suffrage as decidedly mischievous. The
exceptionally enlightened leaders, mentioned in your letter may not
intend, in claiming half, to deny the whole; but such is the power of
words, that every time the phrase manhood suffrage is publicly
pronounced, save in contempt or execration, an additional rivet is added
to the chain of half the human species. It is to be remembered, too,
that universal suffrage was the expression formerly used by all
radicals, & that it was withdrawn & manhood suffrage substituted
precisely because the wider expression had been criticised as including
women. To adopt a phrase which has no other reason of existence than
that it excludes them, would be, in my opinion, to betray the principle
& at the same time, to make a retrograde step.

When any portion or body of the working classes chooses as its programme
a reading & writing (or rather writing and cyphering) qualification,
adult instead of manhood suffrage & Hare’s system, I will gladly give to
such a noble scheme all the help I possibly can. Do not suppose that my
opinion about plural voting2 would be any obstacle. I put that in
abeyance, first because I would accept universal suffrage, & gladly too,
without it (though not without Hare’s system) & next because Buxton has
smashed plural voting for years to come by associating it with
property,3 a thing I have always protested against & would on no account
consent to. Plural voting by right of education I shd not mind defending
to any assemblage of working men in the kingdom. But though I would
always speak my mind on it, it would be no bar to my cooperating. But on
adult suffrage I can make no compromise.

I must therefore defer the pleasure of an introduction to Mrs Kyllmann
till she & you happen to be in London when it will increase the pleasure
I am sure of having from seeing yourself.

The Baden minister whom I referred to must be well known to you—Prof.
Mohl of Heidelberg,4 who advocated Hare’s plan by articles in the Zeit
of Frankfort. Mr Hare has the papers.

Edition: current; Page: [999]
The two French authorities whom I mentioned are Louis Blanc5 (of course)
& Laboulaye.6

P.S. I have the greatest regard & respect for Louis Blanc but I think it
would be fatal to the success of any political movement in this country
to put him forward in it, as his name is associated in the vulgar
English mind with everything that can be made a bugbear of.

Dear Sir—

I will certainly attend the meeting on Tuesday2 & will gladly cooperate
with you in attempting to effect a radical reform in the conduct of the
Reader. It has hitherto been an entire disappointment to me, nothing
whatever having been done to fulfil the expectations held out—& had I
not supposed that the existing arrangements must be only temporary &
that the final ones were not yet installed, I should not have allowed so
much time to elapse without a strenuous remonstrance. The idea is
ridiculous that such a set of men as had been got together shd have
given their money to establish such a wretched thing as, with the
exception of the scientific department, this has hitherto been. The only
chance evidently is that Mr Pollock shd be induced to resign all concern
in the editorship. I shd think there could be no difficulty in finding a
successor. I dare say Professor Cairnes would undertake it if asked,
though he is very unlikely to put himself forward—if he would, I know no
one who would be better qualified & I know him to be most desirous that
the Reader shd be made what we thought it was meant to be, a real organ
of advanced opinions, political & social as well as philosophical.

Dear Sir

Your two letters, with their inclosures, arrived in time; the former of
them only just in time. Mr Pim’s remarks,2 as you anticipated, do not
change any Edition: current; Page: [1002] of my opinions, but they have
enabled me to correct one or two inaccuracies, not so much of fact as of
expression. On reading the proofs of the new matter I have inserted
respecting Ireland3 for most of which I am indebted to you, and in which
consequently your name is mentioned, I feel unwilling that it should see
the light without your imprimatur. I have therefore taken the liberty of
sending you by this post the two sheets of which it forms a part, and I
shall not have them struck off until I hear from you that you do not
object to anything they contain. Any addition or improvement you may
kindly suggest will be most welcome.

The American information is very valuable, and I can hardly be thankful
enough to Mr Ashworth4 and to his Boston correspondent for the trouble
they have taken and the service they have done me. I beg you will convey
to Mr Ashworth my grateful acknowledgements. From their statements it is
clear that the ordinary notion of the extravagantly high rate of profit
in the U. States is an exaggeration, and there seems some doubt whether
the rate is at all higher than in England. But that does not resolve the
puzzle, as even equality of profits, in the face of the higher cost of
labour, indicated by higher money wages, is as paradoxical as
superiority. This is the scientific difficulty I mentioned, and I cannot
yet see my way through it. I have framed a question for the purpose of
bringing it before the P. Ec. Club, which will perhaps be discussed at
the April meeting & if not, at the July.5 I hope you may be present in
either case. You were greatly missed on Friday last. Had not I shone in
plumes borrowed from you, we should not have made much of it, and I
regretted your absence the more, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer was
present, and spoke.6

The American news is better and better. With regard to the chances of a
war between the U. S. and this country, the calamity would be so immense
that the bare possibility of it is enough to cause anxiety, but that
there is any real danger of it I do not believe. This country will give
no cause of quarrel which international law recognises, and the
deeprooted respect of the Americans for law and judicial tribunals is a
very strong ground of reliance in the last resort. I attach no
importance at all to any general impression in this country that there
will be war. It is, to my thinking, a mere expression of the state of
mind of people who, under the teaching of the Times and Dr Mackay,7
never allowed themselves to imagine that the North could succeed, and
consequently Edition: current; Page: [1003] let loose their tongues in
the certainty, as they thought, of complete impunity, and now having
come to perceive that their precious protégés are beaten, and anxious to
buy off war with the North by war with Europe, they are frightened, and
cry “What is to become of us.” If all they are in the habit of saying of
democracy were true, they might be right. But those who hate democracy
most do not at all understand its characteristic weaknesses: one of
which is that the outward signs of public opinion are at the absolute
command of professional excitement-makers, to which category most of the
journalists and nearly all the politicians in the U. S. belong.
Accordingly all the politicians, even the President’s own cabinet, are
in the daily habit of bidding high for the good word of these people,
who are lords and masters of their momentary estimation; but when things
grow serious, the President with his responsibility, and the Northern
and Western farmers with their simple honesty, come forth and trample
out the nonsense, which therefore never tells on serious public
transactions, though making a very formidable appearance in spoken and
written words.

I much regret to hear that you have been obliged to suspend what you
were writing on the land question.—The affairs of the Reader8 seem to
have reached a crisis. I am going to a meeting of the proprietors on
Tuesday to help Spencer in attempting to upset the present arrangements.
I will write to you immediately afterwards.

TO JAMES BEAL1

B[lackheath] P[ark]

March 7, 1865

Dear Sir—

Your note, I am sorry to say, did not reach me till yesterday evening
owing to a mistake at the postoffice.

To be the representative of Westr is an honour to which no one can be
insensible, & to have been selected as worthy of that honour by a body
like that in whose name you write not only without solicitation but
without my being personally known to them either in a public or private
capacity is a very signal one indeed.2 While it must ever command my
sincere gratitude, it is a proceeding which nothing but the truest
public spirit could have dictated. And the mode in which you propose to
ascertain the sense of the electors cannot be too highly applauded.3 It
is an example deserving to be imitated by all popular constituencies &
worthy of the rank which belongs historically to Westminster as the head
& front of the Reform party.

In answer, therefore, to your question, I assent to having my name
submitted to the electors in the proposed manner, if, after the
explanations which it is now my duty to give, the Committee should still
adhere to their intention.

I have no personal object to be promoted by a seat in Parlt. All private
considerations are against my accepting it. The only motive that could
make me desire it would be the hope of being useful: and being untried
in any similar position, it is as yet quite uncertain whether I am as
capable of rendering public service in the H[ouse] of C[ommons] as I may
be in the more tranquil occupation of a writer. It is, however, certain,
that if I can be of any use in Parlt it could only be by devoting myself
there to the same subjects which have employed my habitual thoughts out
of Parlt. I therefore could not undertake the charge of any of your
local business: & as this, in so important a constituency, must
necessarily be heavy, it is not impossible that my inability to
undertake it may in itself amount to a disqualification for being your
representative.

Again, my only object in Parliament would be to promote my opinions.
What these are, on nearly all the political questions in which the
public feel Edition: current; Page: [1006] any interest, is before the
world: & until I am convinced that they are wrong, these & no others are
the opinions that I must act on. I am ready to give any further
explanation of them that might be wished for, & shd I be elected I would
freely state to my constituents whenever desired, the votes I intend to
give, & my reasons for them. But I could give no other pledge. If the
electors are sufficiently satisfied with my opinions as they are, to be
willing to give me a trial, I would do my best to serve those opinions &
would in no case disguise my intentions or my motives from those to whom
I should be indebted for the opportunity.

Lastly, it is neither suitable to my circumstances nor consistent with
my principles to spend money for my election. Without necessarily
condemning those who do, when it is not expended in corruption, I am
deeply convinced that there can be no Parliamentary Reform worthy of the
name, so long as a seat in Parliament is only attainable by rich men, or
by those who have rich men at their back. It is the interest of the
constituencies to be served by men who are not aiming at personal
objects, either pecuniary, official, or social, but consenting to
undertake gratuitously an onerous duty to the public. That such persons
should be made to pay for permission to do hard & difficult work for the
general advantage, is neither worthy of a free people, nor is it the way
to induce the best men to come forward. In my own case, I must even
decline to offer myself to the electors in any manner; because, proud as
I should be of their suffrages, & though I would endeavour to fulfil to
the best of my ability the duty to which they might think fit to elect
me, yet I have no wish to quit my present occupations for the H. of C.
unless called upon to do so by my fellow-citizens. That the electors of
Westr have even thought of my name in this conjuncture is a source of
deep gratification to me, & if I were to be elected I shd wish to owe
every step in my election, as I shd already owe my nomination, to their
spontaneous & flattering judgment of the labours of my life.

Whatever be the result as regards myself, allow me to express the hope
that your recommendation to the electors will not be limited to two
names. To obtain the best representative & even, if only to ensure
success against the powerful local influence which is already in the
field,4 it seems plainly desirable to give the electors the widest
possible choice among all persons, willing to serve, who would worthily
represent the advanced liberal & reforming party. Several eminent
persons have been mentioned, whom it would be highly desirable to give
the electors an opportunity of selecting if they please. Edition:
current; Page: [1007] Sir J. Romilly5 is in the number of these, &
would, in every way, do honour to your choice. Mr Chadwick would be one
of the most valuable members who could be chosen by any constituency; &
besides the many important public questions on which he is one of the
first authorities, he is peculiarly qualified to render those services
in connexion with your local business which it would not, in general, be
possible for me to perform. The admirable mode of selection which you
have adopted will not have fair play unless you bring before the
consideration of the electors the whole range of choice, among really
good candidates, which lies within their reach. It will not be inferred
from your placing any particular person on the list, that you consider
him the best. Some will prefer one & some another; & those who are
preferred by the greatest number of electors would alone be nominated.

In requesting you to lay this matter before the Comee, I beg to assure
yourself & them that whatever may be their decision, I shall never cease
to feel the proposal they have made to me as one of the greatest
compliments I have ever received.

I am Dear Sir very sincerely & respectfully yours

Dear Lord Amberley

Dr Chapman writes to me that he should be very glad to have you as a
contributor,2 but that he would prefer political to theological
articles; not that he thinks your articles “would be less able if
theological,” but because he is disposed to lessen the quantity of
theological and increase that of scientific matter in the Review. I do
not think this need affect you practically in any way. The greatest
utility of the Westminster Review is that it is willing to print bolder
opinions on all subjects than the other periodicals: and when you feel
moved to write anything that is too strong for other Reviews, you will
generally be able to get it into the Westminster. The fact is, Chapman
is Edition: current; Page: [1008] stronger in theological contributors
than in political, and would like to be strengthened where he is
weakest.

I see no reason against your offering him what you have written on

I thank you sincerely for your further favours in regard to my Political
Economy. I have sent your new matter to press, and have profited to the
full by your observations on what I had myself written. I am indebted to
you for nearly all which will give to that chapter of the book,2 any
present value.

Your solution of the difficulty as to American profits3 is perfectly
scientific, and was the one which had occurred to myself. As far as it
goes, I fully admit it; but my difficulty was, and still is, in
believing that there can be so great a difference between the cost of
obtaining the precious metals in America and in England, as to make the
enormous difference which seems to exist in money wages, consistent with
a difference the contrary way in the cost of labour. It is impossible to
approfondir the subject in time for the present edition. I have
contented myself, therefore, with qualifying the opinion I had
previously expressed,4 so as to leave the subject open for further
inquiry.

The meetings of the Pol. Ec. Club are on the first Friday in every month
of the season, except when Easter interferes, and as it will not
interfere this year, the next meeting, I have no doubt, will be on the
7th. As you thought of being in London on the 8th, I hope your arrival
may admit of being accelerated to that extent. I wish it the more, as we
are going away in as few days after the meeting as my printing will
allow, which I hope will be very few—and I may perhaps, therefore, lose
the opportunity of seeing you before Midsummer, unless I see you then.

I am very glad that there is another writer in Ireland besides yourself,
who writes such excellent articles on America as the one you sent me.5

I have directed to be sent to you (in Dublin) a separate copy of an
article of mine on Comte, which is to be in the forthcoming Westminster.

reviewing it,3 than to try to condense into a few pages the general
results. I look forward with the greatest pleasure to your account of
the longer and more important dialogues; more important, I mean, in
point of doctrine. The character, scope, and value of the purely

From your letter, which came this morning, I am afraid you never
received a short note which I wrote to you, to the effect that the
“Reader” meeting was postponed to next Tuesday, the 21st, at the wish of
many shareholders who desired to attend.2 I am very sorry that there is
no chance of your being present. The fons malorum appears to be, that
after it had been arranged that there should be five departmental
editors, the publishers thought it necessary that there should be a
general one and this title was consequently given to Mr F. Pollock; who,
contrary [to] the intention and understanding of some at least of the
shareholders has assumed a control over all the departments. The object
ought to be to get Mr Pollock out—but to do this, it will be necessary
to put somebody else in. Now, would you allow me (in case the discussion
renders it necessary or expedient) to say that you would be willing to
accept the position of Editor? I know of no one connected with the
Reader Edition: current; Page: [1012] who would be equally fit, and I am
not aware if any other is inclined, as you have told me that you are, to
give a considerable part of his time to the Reader. You may rely on me
for not letting it appear as if you had sought the position, knowing as
I do that you have not: I will take the whole responsibility of the
proposal on myself. But I should like to be able to say that I have
reason to think that you would not refuse.

I am sorry to find that I have no chance of seeing you before I go

Dear Sir,—

Nothing can, to my estimation, be more desirable than that you should
take an active part in the projected Reform Conference (the London
Conference).2 It is of vast importance that any great public cause
should be taken up by men who are not (in the phraseology of the great
English revolution) self-seekers; and you, having been at the head of a
valuable popular organisation,3 would very probably be urged to render a
similar office to the new one which it is proposed to form. Of course
the Edition: current; Page: [1013] desirableness of your doing so
depends on the goodness of the object which the organisation is meant to
promote; and on this no one can judge for you but yourself. For my own
part, I could not presume to advise on what it would be right for you to
do, since I do not sufficiently know your opinions on the particular
points on which Radical reformers differ. I can only respond to your
very flattering confidence by saying what I should think it right to do
myself in this or any similar case.

I have long since determined that, for myself, I will never join in any
movement for what is called manhood suffrage. Adult suffrage is what I
contend for; and when one goes in, not for an object immediately
attainable, but for a principle, we ought to go the whole length of it.
No reason, either of right or of expediency, can be found to justify
giving the suffrage to men, exclusively of women, and the word manhood
suffrage, having been substituted for the good old phrase, universal
suffrage, for the express purpose of showing that women are not
included, to adopt it is to give a direct assent to their exclusion.

On the other hand, I consider an educational qualification, to the
extent of reading and writing (I would even add ciphering)
indispensable. It is to be hoped that before long, this restriction will
no longer exclude anybody; and I could have no adults excluded on any
other ground. But adult suffrage is not complete unless minorities have
their fair share of representation. If 50,000 electors have to elect
five members, it is not fair and equal representation that 30,000 of
them should be able, by outvoting the others, to elect all five. The
30,000 are only entitled to three members and the remaining 20,000 to
two. This is not, as is sometimes pretended, a proposal made for the
purpose of defeating democracy. On the contrary it is positively
required by democratic principles. Democracy is not the exclusive rule
of the greater number and the virtual disfranchisement of the rest, but
the equal representation of all; majorities returning a majority, and
minorities a minority. Mr. Hare’s admirable plan is the best that has
been proposed for securing the equal representation of minorities, and
would incidentally attain many other important objects. It is, as I
hear, making some way among the intelligent leaders of the working
classes at Manchester.4 I should not, however, make that particular plan
a sine qua non; but the acknowledgement of the principle, that
minorities ought to be represented in proportion to their numbers, seems
to me indispensable to show that the working classes are willing to
allow the same justice to others which they claim for themselves. In the
present state of the constituencies, the working-classes would
themselves benefit by it. And it is hardly possible to exaggerate the
moral effect that would be produced Edition: current; Page: [1014] in
favour of them and their cause, by such a proof that they do not aim at
merely substituting one class ascendency for another, but demand for
every class a hearing, and such influence as it is entitled to.

Neither would I support equal electoral districts, because I do not
think that any one class, even though the most numerous, should be able
to return a decided majority of the whole Legislature. But I would
support any readjustment of the constituencies that would enable the
working classes to command half the votes in Parliament. The most
important questions in practical politics are coming to be those in
which the working classes as a body are arrayed on one side, and the
employers as a body on the other; as in all questions of wages, hours of
labour, and so on. If those whose partialities are on the side of the
operatives had half the representation, and those who lean to the side
of the employers had the other half, the side which was in the right
would be almost sure to prevail, by the aid of an enlightened and
disinterested minority of the other. But there would not be the same
assurance of this if either the working classes, or a combination of all
other classes could command a decided majority in Parliament.

Lastly, I could not support the ballot.

It is extremely probable that these opinions may prevent me from being
able to co-operate with any organised movement for reform that we may
have any chance of seeing at present. If, as is not unlikely, your
opinions are different, you have not the same reason for abstaining. But
it would, I think, be a good thing if the movers could be induced to
leave some of these points, and particularly the ballot, in the position
of open questions. By doing so, they would enable many earnest reformers
to join them, who would never consent to support the ballot, but who
would not refuse to connect themselves with those who do.

I thank you very sincerely for your kind invitation; but I do not feel
called on to attend the conference.5 I think that I can probably do more
good as an isolated thinker, forming and expressing my opinions
independently, than by associating myself with any collective movement,
which, in my case, would almost always imply putting some of my opinions
in abeyance. Your position is different, and you seem to me to be, in a
manner, called (if you will allow me the expression) to take part in
such movements, and endeavour to direct them to right objects.

I have stated my opinions very imperfectly, but they are all expressed
as well as I am able to express them in my volume on Representative
Government.

I am, dear Sir, very sincerely and respectfully yours,

I have read your papers on Parliamentary Reform, and I certainly think
that as long as the electoral franchise is determined by rental, rating
to the house tax is a better basis for it than rating to the poor rate;
the house tax being, of course, brought down, as you propose, to the
lowest rental which it is intended to admit to the suffrage, and being
extended to lodgers as well as householders. There is another part of
your plan of which I very highly approve; the provision which visits the
receiver of a bribe with loss of the franchise, and the giver of one
with permanent disqualification for sitting in Parliament.—I am, Sir,

Dear Sir

The Reader meeting took place yesterday afternoon,2 and after a three
hours debate, it was adjourned to Wednesday April 5th, when the question
will be decided, whether to wind up the concern, or to conduct it in a
totally Edition: current; Page: [1018] different manner. Mr Pollock, who
has edited it up to the present time, and some others of the Directors
were for selling the paper, since as it had, in their opinion, deserved
success, they thought the experiment had been well tried and had failed.
But the opinion that it had not been well tried, was that of a large
majority, including Spencer, Huxley, Tyndal[l], and the better part of
the subscribers generally; and the manifestation of this opinion on
their part, induced Mr Pollock to resign the editorship. There is a
fortnight in which to determine whether and how the paper can be carried
on. Spencer is full of hope and confidence, saying that the obstacle is
removed, that we shall now be unanimous, and that it will be carried on
in our own way. He and his supporters certainly have the right notion of
how to carry it on; that it should have decided opinions, that they
should be those of advanced liberalism, political, scientific, and
theological, and that one of the objects should be (as Huxley said) to
carry the scientific spirit into politics. The financial affairs seem to
have been as much mismanaged as everything else, but they are not, in
the opinion of those present, irretrievable: when all retrenchments are
made, the concern will not be losing more than £6 a week, and the
opinion is, that if the eight shares which have not been assigned, are
taken up as it is thought that they may be, on the footing of preference
shares, this and the £10 still due on the old shares will enable the
experiment to be tried long enough to give it a chance of success. A
good deal has been lost in money, and I should think, in reputation by
what Huxley called our false start; but he and the rest think it is not
too late to retrieve it. If they succeed between this and April 5 in
organizing the management, both in the business and in the writing
department, as well as they think they can, I shall be disposed to give
them all the little help which is consistent with my occupations. I need
hardly say of how great importance your cooperation would be, even if
only as a writer, and much more if you would still be willing to take
charge of a department.

I have again gone through your exposition of profits in the papers you
so kindly took the trouble of writing for me; and I think, as before,
that your mode of putting the doctrine is very good as one among others,
and that there is no difference of opinion between us.3 I still,
however, prefer my own mode of statement, for reasons which it would be
long to state, and which I have not time at present to reconsider from
the foundations. I am inclined to think that the real solution of the
difficulty, and the only one it admits of, Edition: current; Page:
[1019] has been given by myself in a subsequent place, Book III, ch.
xix, 2 (vol. ii. p. 156 of the fifth edition.)4

Your anxieties about the mischief makers on the subject of America must
have been a good deal relieved by the debate in which Disraeli and the
other Tories vied with the Liberals in disclaiming all idea of the
probability of war,5 and of any conduct on the part of the United States
which could produce or justify it. Both the Times and the Saturday
Review have backed out of what they said on the probability of war.6 I

I have sent to you through Thornton the Appeal of the Wolverhampton

case. They appear to me preeminently entitled to support. What is the
way in which we can best help them? For myself I mean to write them a
letter and send them a subscription, but any pecuniary help will be a
mere drop in the bucket unless some portion of the public can be induced
to join in it. The best way I can think of is that some one should write
a letter to the Spectator (which from its connexion with Ludlow and
Maurice, is likely to be favourable) and invite subscriptions;3 in which
case we ought to send in a few names to commence with. If you agree in
this, should you be willing to write such a letter with your name to it?
And do you think you could get a few subscribers’ names? Thornton will
be one. If you are disposed to do this, and will let me know, I will at
once endeavour to get a few names. I am

Sir—

I beg to inclose a subscription of £10 to aid, as far as such a sum can
do it, in the struggle which the Cooperative Plate Lock makers of
Wolverhampton are sustaining against unfair competition on the part of
the masters in the trade.2 Against fair competition I have no desire to
shield them. Cooperative production carried on by persons whose hearts
are in the cause, & who are capable of the energy & self denial always
necessary in its early stages ought to be able to hold its ground
against private establishments; and persons who have not those qualities
had better not attempt it. But to carry on business at a loss in order
to ruin competitors is not fair competition. In such a contest, if
prolonged, the competitors who have the smallest means, though they may
have every other element of success, must necessarily be crushed through
no fault of their own. I am now convinced that they ought to be
supported against the attempt to ruin them. Having the strongest
sympathy with your vigorous attempt to make head against what in such a
case may justly be called the tyranny of capital I beg you to send me a
dozen copies of your printed appeal to assist me in making the case
known to such persons as it may interest in your favour.

Dear Sir

I was very glad to see your Appeal in the Daily News.2 It will, no
doubt, have been read by some persons with profit. But the editor has
not afforded the opportunity I hoped for, of a “rejoinder” to comments
of his own on your paper. Without something like controversy to give
interest and attract readers, an attempt to press the subject further by
more letters in the paper at the present time would, I think, be lost
labour. You no doubt feel with me, Edition: current; Page: [1021] that
nothing ought to be more avoided than accustoming people to regard the
subject as a bore. Our best chance of being able to do anything at
present, lies in the proposed Social Science meeting3—the way for which
ought to be prepared by a previous circulation of your paper, in a
separate form, among selected persons. But the time of year is an
obstacle to the meeting, unless it could be held at the end of the week
after next, immediately after your return; Passion Week, I suppose,
would be objected to; and in the fortnight following, many whose
attendance might otherwise be hoped for, will be out of town. I myself
would willingly put off my departure for days, but to postpone it for
weeks would deprive my year of its spring. And I doubt if a meeting in
May would have any very material advantage over one in July. This,
however, is in the hands of those who are much better judges of the
expediences than I can be.

Many thanks for your kindness about Lord Russell’s book.4 We got it from

Your note, received today, would have reminded me, if I had forgotten,
that I have another communication of yours still to acknowledge. I have
just Edition: current; Page: [1023] read it again for the fourth or
fifth time, and find a great deal of meaning in it. To understand it
entirely I must wait for your promised paper.2 But I have little doubt
that you will find out, and make intelligible at all events to
psychologists, whatever there is to be found out in that direction.

I hope you have good accounts from your son.3 The Mediterranean, with
the exception perhaps of Rome, is certainly ill suited for irritable
respiratory organs. It is bad for the bronchitis which usually
accompanies consumption. When, as sometimes happens, the pulmonary
disorder is unaccompanied with bronchial irritability, then, I believe,
the dry sharp air of such places as Nice, Naples, &c. is beneficial, by
its bracing effect on the system generally. But that is not the common
case.

Your conjecture about the original meaning of the word Compliment4
reminds me of the way in which it occurs in the English translations of
the letters of Indian princes and nobles to the Governor General of
India. These translations always begin with the words “After
Compliments” which are the equivalent of a long string of high sounding
ceremonial phrases in the original, which, as being matters of course in
formal Asiatic correspondence, may well be dismissed under the general
denomination of “fillings up.”

Your proposed letter2 is very good as to substance, but I think it would
be much improved by some alterations in form, and especially in the
order of the topics. It would be made much more effective by going at
once in medias res, saying first of all who are the persons addressing
the electors, and what they want the electors to do, and then giving the
reasons. I have put upon paper, rather hastily and roughly, how I think
the letter might run. Of course it is a mere suggestion, to be dealt
with in any manner that you, or Mr Beal think fit.

I would not mention subscribers in the letter. A list of them can be
appended if desirable. I also think the electors should not be told that
their returning the paper will amount to a promise, since many might be
willing to express their preference who would be deterred from doing so
if they thought they were absolutely binding themselves.

Dear Sir

The Reader meeting yesterday was satisfactory.2 Huxley and Tyndall have
made all the arrangements; the editor is to be a Mr Rae,3 a barrister,
who wrote the article on Taine in the January number of the Westminster
Review,4 and who, Huxley says, is a strong liberal, and bent upon making
the paper a liberal organ. The editorial and all other literary expenses
are placed on a very moderate scale, and Mr Rae’s pay is to be credited
as payment on two shares in the paper, which he is to take. The other
deficient shares (all but three) are either taken, or expected to be
taken immediately. All business expenses will be reduced as much as is
consistent with efficiency, and so that the present receipts (if not
diminished by a further falling off in the advertisements) will cover
them. Spencer is elected a Director in the room of Pollock, and he and
others mean for the present to write as much as they can in the paper.
It is perfectly understood that original articles of any kind will be
received as well as reviews, and that signing, either by name or
initials, will be rather encouraged than otherwise. The greatest drag
is, that no fewer than 32 reviews, actually accepted, are on hand: but
though all these must be paid for there are hopes that only the best of
them will be used. I therefore think that the prospects of making the
paper a useful organ are now as good as they seemed to be at first. Mr
Hughes5 was very particular in his enquiries after you, and desired me
to tell you that he hopes to see you as soon as you arrive in London. He
thinks your cooperation of the greatest possible value, and hopes that
you will be able to write a good deal; the more, as most of the others
are so very much occupied. For myself, I think that success will depend
more on your cooperation than on anything else. You will now (I think)
be well supported, but there is need of some one, capable of writing
well on great subjects, who will stick to the thing and write regularly,
and I hope it may suit you to do so.

In case this Westminster movement should come to anything, which I
cannot bring myself to think at all probable, it will be a great
encouragement to me that you express a deliberate and well considered
opinion in favour of the desirableness of my being in Parliament.
However this may be, there is something very encouraging in the
enthusiasm which has been excited, both in Edition: current; Page:
[1027] Westminster and elsewhere, not simply for me, but for the opinion
respecting the proper position of a candidate, which I expressed in my
letter.6 You would be surprised at some of the people who have come
forward unasked to offer subscriptions merely from reading the letter.
What do you think of Howell and James7 offering £50, Fortnum and Mason
of Piccadilly,8 I believe the same sum, Debenhams9 the auctioneers £100,
two brothers, wine merchants in Bond Street another £100? The greatest
pleasure which public life could give me would be if it enabled me to
shew that more can be accomplished by supposing that there is reason and
good feeling in the mass of mankind than by proceeding on the ordinary
assumption that they are fools and rogues.

My printing is nearly finished, and we start for Avignon on the 11th. To
what address should books, or parcels be sent for you before you arrive

Dear Sir

I have written to Mr Lubbock2 to express my great satisfaction at his
being a candidate, and the pleasure it would give me to be of any use to
him. One of whom you express so high an opinion must be a very desirable
member of the advanced liberal party in Parliament or anywhere.

I leave for Avignon on Tuesday evening, but will endeavour to send
something for the Reader occasionally from thence.

Dear Sir

You are in the way of seeing many newspapers and periodicals, and it is
probable that during my absence in France articles, connected with the
Westminster election or with myself personally, may come under your
notice, which I should be glad to see. If such should be the case, would
it be very troublesome to you to cut out the articles and send them to
me by post? Of course it is a condition that you will allow me to pay
all expenses, whether of buying, posting, or anything else. Reviews of
my books are not included, as I shall receive them through my publisher.

If you would kindly undertake this for me, I should be greatly obliged.

With our kind remembrances to Mrs Plummer I am

Dear Sir

I thank you very much for having enabled me to correct a proof of the
second article on Comte before leaving. I have asked the printers to
send a revise to Avignon. I should be much obliged if you would kindly
let me have the same number of copies (20) as of the former article, and
cause them to be sent to the same persons, with the difference of
sending five instead of four to M. Littré, and one to M. Dupont-White,
11 Rue d’Angoulême Saint-Honoré, Paris; leaving only four copies for
myself, to be sent here, and not to Avignon. The earlier the separate
copies could be got ready, the better I should like it, as some of those
who have had copies of the first would be glad to have the second as
soon after it as possible. But this, of course, must be entirely
subordinate to your arrangements.

M. Littré will take care that the translation is not published till
after the second article has appeared in the Westminster.2

I leave for Avignon this evening.

I have sent the few subscriptions I have received to Mr Hughes, whose
letter in last Saturday’s Spectator you have perhaps seen.2 Mr Hughes
has also collected a few, and intended handing them over to Mr Hutton,
the editor of the Spectator, to be published in next Saturday’s paper.3
I think the best thing you could do with yours would be to send it in a
note to the editor, so that it might appear in the same list.

The Social Science meeting went off well,4 and was very full. Lord
Stanley presided, and brought out Hare’s strength by good questions. The
reports Edition: current; Page: [1031] which I have seen give no idea at

April 17, 1865

]

Dear Sir—

I beg leave to acknowledge your communication of the 12th inst.
informing me that at a meeting of Westminster Electors2 it has been
resolved to adopt me as a candidate on the terms of my letter of March
7th & to invite subscriptions to defray the expenses of my election.

On the subject of this Resolution it would not become me to say
anything, except what might equally be said by one who had no personal
interest in the matter: That if the Electors of Westminster return to
Parlt as their representative any one, either myself or another, who has
no claim whatever on them except their opinion of his fitness for the
trust, & if on that sole ground they elect him without personal
solicitation & without expense, they will do what is as eminently
honourable to themselves as to the object of their choice, will set an
example worthy to be, & likely to be, imitated by other great
constituencies—& will signally raise the character of the popular party
& advance the cause of Reform.

On this part of the subject, I have only further to express the earnest
hope, that in accepting me on the terms of my letter, the Meeting
intended to include Edition: current; Page: [1032] in their adhesion the
principle of an individual appeal by circular to every elector, laying
other names before him as well as mine & requesting him to select from
among them or from any others the person or persons whom he would wish
to be brought forward as candidates.

I am also invited to state, for the more full information of the
electors, my opinions on various political questions of general
interest. Such a call can only be properly answered by the most complete
openness. I hold decided opinions on all the subjects on which my
sentiments are asked, & whether those opinions may serve or injure me in
the estimation of the electors it is equally incumbent on me to state
them plainly.

1. With regard to Reform Bills: I shd vote at once both for Mr. Baines’
bill3 & for Mr. Locke King’s,4 & for measures going far beyond either of
them. I would open the suffrage to all grown persons, both men & women,
who can read, write, & perform a sum in the rule of three, & who have
not, within some small number of years, received parish relief. At the
same time, utterly abominating all class ascendancy, I would not vote
for giving the suffrage in such a manner that any class, even though it
be the most numerous, could swamp all other classes taken together. In
the first place, I think that all considerable minorities in the country
or in a locality should be represented in proportion to their numbers.
What other adjustments of the electoral system to an universal or nearly
universal suffrage might prove practically the best adapted to secure to
every portion of the community its just share of influence, while
preventing any class from acquiring an unjust degree of preponderance
either by means of property or of numbers, is a question which may be
answered in many different ways & which will require much sifting &
public discussion before the best can be selected. In the meanwhile I
shd be prepared to support a measure which would give to the labouring
classes a clear half of the national representation.

2. I prefer a mixed system of direct & indirect taxation to either
alone. If the attempt were made to raise so large a revenue as ours
after all due retrenchments would still be exclusively by direct
taxation, I do not know of any taxes, in themselves just, which, under
such strong pecuniary temptation, would not be successfully evaded. The
evasions of the income tax are already a disgrace to the national
morality. I would in no case tax any of the necessaries of life; but if
even a working man expends in luxuries for himself, & Edition: current;
Page: [1033] especially in stimulants, what is required by the
necessities of his family, I think it perfectly just that he shd be
taxed on such expenditure.

3. Every civilised country is entitled to settle its internal affairs in
its own [way], & no other country ought to interfere with its
discretion, because one country, even with the best intentions, has no
chance of properly understanding the internal affairs of another: but
when this indefeasible liberty of an independent country has already
been interfered with; when it is kept in subjection by a foreign power,
either directly, or by assistance given to its native tyrants, I hold
that any nation whatever may rightfully interfere to protect the country
against this wrongful interference. I therefore approve the
interposition of France in 1859 to free Italy from the Austrian yoke,5
but disapprove the intervention of the same country in 1849 to compel
the Pope’s subjects to take back the bad government they had cast off.6
It is not however a necessary consequence that because a thing might
rightfully be done, it is always expedient to do it. I would not have
voted for a war in behalf either of Poland7 or of Denmark,8 because on
any probable view of consequences I shd have expected more evil than
good from our doing what, nevertheless, if done would not have been, in
my opinion, any violation of international duty.

4. Respecting the disabilities of Dissenters my answer may be brief.
There ought to be no disabilities whatever on account of religion.

5. Voting for a member of parlt is a public & political act, which
concerns not solely the elector’s individual preferences, but the most
important interests of the other electors, of the non-electors, and even
of posterity: & my conviction is that in a free country all such acts
shd be done in the face & subject to the comments & criticisms of the
entire public. I wish that the elector shd feel an honourable shame in
voting contrary to his known opinions, & in not being able to give for
his vote a reason which he can avow. The publicity which lets in these
salutary influences admits also, unfortunately, some noxious ones; & if
I believed that these were now the strongest—if I thought Edition:
current; Page: [1034] that the electors of this country were in such a
state of hopeless & slavish dependence on particular landlords,
employers, or customers, that the bad influences are more than a match
for the good ones, & that there is no other means of removing them, I
should be, as I once was, a supporter of the ballot. But the voters are
not now in this degraded condition: they need nothing to protect them
against electoral intimidation but the spirit & courage to defy it. In
an age when the most dependent class of all, the labouring class, is
proving itself capable of maintaining by combination an equal struggle
with the combined power of the masters, I cannot admit that farmers or
shopkeepers, if they stand by one another, need despair of protecting
themselves against any abuse now possible of the power of landed or
other wealth.

6. As regards retrenchment, it is certain that chiefly through unskilful
management great sums of public money are now squandered, for which the
country receives no equivalent in the efficiency of its establishments,
& that we might have a more useful army & navy than we possess, at a
considerably less expense. I expect little improvement in this respect
until the increased influence of the smaller taxpayers on the
government, through a large extension of the suffrage, shall have
produced a stricter control over the details of public expenditure. But
I cannot think that it would be right for us to disarm in the presence
of the great military despotisms of Europe, which regard our freedom
through its influence on the minds of their own subjects, as the
greatest danger as well as reproach to themselves, & might be tempted to
pick a quarrel with us, even without any prospect of ultimate success,
in the mere hope of reviving the national antipathies which so long kept
apart the best minds of England & of the Continent.

7. I am decidedly of opinion that landed property shd be subject to the
Probate Duty, & that property in settlement should pay succession duty
on its full value & not, as at present, only on the value of the life
interest.

8. Purchase is the very worst way but one, in which Commissions in the
army could possibly be appropriated. The one, which is still worse, is
jobbing & favoritism. I would support any mode in which the one evil can
be got rid of without replacing it by the other. That there is such a
mode I am fully satisfied, & that it would put an end to what is justly
called in your letter, the monopoly by certain classes of the posts of
emolument.

9. I am entirely opposed to flogging, either in the army or out of it,
except for crimes of brutality. In some of those it seems to me a very
appropriate punishment.

10. The differences between employers & workpeople which give rise to
strikes, are, it appears to me, a subject which wholly escapes the
control of legislation. I see nothing which law can do in the matter
except to protect from violation the equal liberty of all to combine or
to refrain from combining. Edition: current; Page: [1035] After a
sufficient trial of each other’s strength, both sides will probably be
willing to refer their disputes to arbitration, but even then I do not
think that the arbitrators should have power to enforce their decisions
by law; because, in such cases as they would usually have to decide, it
is impossible to lay down rules of justice & equity which would suit all
cases, or would obtain universal assent: & the adjustments must
generally be of the nature of compromises, not acting on fixed
principles, but each side giving up something for the sake of peace. I
do not presume to say that a better rule may not be arrived at in time,
but it would be quite premature to act as if it had already been arrived
at.

I am, Dear Sir,
 very sincerely yours

I have received your note dated the 11th. and Mr Beal’s official
announcement of the decision of the Meeting.2 The same post which takes
this carries my reply to him, of which I inclose a copy.

When I saw them advertising for subscriptions for my election singly, I
was alarmed lest they should have abandoned the intention of proposing
any other names. Should this unfortunately happen, and should you,
thereupon, go forward independently, I beg that you will at once put
down my name for a subscription of £50, for which I will send a cheque
as soon as your Committee is constituted.

I have suggested to Longman (as you recommended) that he should
advertise in the penny papers,3 weekly as well as daily, and have now
written again to recommend his not omitting the Morning Advertiser4—

I shall be very glad to see the article in the Saturday Review,2 as my

will be advisable, if you have not already sent the number, to cut out
the article and send it only.

I have always contemplated reprinting the articles on Comte as soon as
is consistent with the interest of the Review; and if Mr Trübner3 wishes
to be the publisher, no one has so good a claim. We will therefore

Dear Hickson

Your letter, as you are probably by this time aware, did not find me in
England.

I did not, I believe, reserve the right of translation as regards the
book on Liberty. But I have had two applications from intending
translators of it. The first was from my friend Professor Villari of
Pisa, author of the Life of Savonarola, and of an enlightened and
thoughtful Report on Education in England.2 The second was from Alberto
Mario,3 Garibaldi’s Secretary and fellow-combatant, the husband of
Madame White Mario. Him I referred to Professor Villari, and as the
latter has his time very fully occupied, it is not improbable that he
may have given up his project, in favour of Mario. In what state the
matter is, I do not know, and I can only suggest, that the gentleman who
does me the honour to make a third proposal, should ascertain what are
the present intentions of his two predecessors. If they have abandoned
their purpose, or desist from it in his favour, I give him the full
consent which his politeness induces him to ask, but which he does not,
for any legal purpose, require.

Death has indeed been busy lately, and one is continually reminded, if
at our age we needed reminding, of our mortality. Cobden4 was perhaps
the most perfectly honest man among all English politicians of his time
and of anything like his celebrity, for he meant every word that he
said. Is the Lucas who has just died,5 the same who wrote so many
literary articles in the Times, and who had just started a new Magazine?

I hope you are well, and Mrs. Hickson at least no worse.

Dear Chadwick

Dr Lankester2 and the others whom you mention, fancy, I suppose, that
they would diminish their chance of carrying one candidate by attempting
two; in which opinion they might be right if they were proceeding in the
old beaten track, and bringing forward a candidate in the commonplace,
stupid way. But on the plan which was proposed, of going to the electors
with a list of names, it would not be they, but the electors, who would
determine to have two new candidates, and would decide who they should
be. The Committee would be taking nothing upon themselves but to carry
out the declared wishes of a body of electors requiring only
organization. I fear from the apparent hanging back from executing this
plan, that they have grown cold on the subject, and finding that they
are getting praised for proposing me, and for the other honourable
features of the case, the exemption from canvassing, pledges, and
expense, they are content with that, and do not seek for more. If it is
so, it is a great mistake, and an opportunity lost, independently of the
great value to public objects, and even specially to Westminster of
making you one of its members. But I still hope for better things. As to
your own conduct in exerting yourself for my election exactly as if you
had no claims of your own, I cannot praise it more highly than by saying
that it is like everything else I have seen of your public conduct.

As to my last letter,3 I expected that it would damage my chance. If it
does no worse than you seem to think, I shall reckon it wholly a
success. I do not see how I could have refused to answer questions about
my opinions, put in the very letter which announced the acceptance of me
as a candidate. It can only be a small proportion of the electors who
have ever looked into my books. But I do not think my answers to
questions will admit of being confounded with pledges, especially as
several of them are opposed to the general opinion of those who support
me. I hope there are many more Tories who will take your Tory friend’s
view of women’s votes.

The glorious news from America is dreadfully dashed by the terrible
report Edition: current; Page: [1039] about Lincoln.4 The idea of its
being true is scarcely endurable—but the cause will not suffer—may even
benefit by it, now.

Dear Sir—

I have received your two notes & your pamphlet,2 which I think is one of
the best of your writings, & well calculated to stir up the thinking
minds among the working classes to larger views of political questions.
So far as I am myself concerned, I cannot but be pleased to find you in
sympathy with some of the most generally unpopular of my political
notions. For my own part, I attach for the present more importance to
representation of minorities, and especially to Mr Hare’s plan, combined
with opening the suffrage to women, than to the plural voting which, in
the form proposed by Mr Buxton, of attaching the plurality of votes
directly to property,3 I have always strongly repudiated. But I think
what you say of it likely to be very useful by impressing on the working
people that it is no degradation to them to consider some people’s votes
of more value than others. I would always (as you do) couple with the
plurality the condition of it being accessible to any one, however poor,
who proves that he can come up to a certain standard of knowledge.

I have delayed thanking you for the first number of your Herculanean
series,2 in hopes that I should have been able to say something about
the work itself. I have, however, been so busy, that I have not yet had
time to do more than read your Preface and Introduction and merely
glance at the Greek text. What you say of it, however, proves it to be,
at the very least, a highly important and novel contribution to the
history of Greek thought, and I look forward with great pleasure to
making a real study of it at some not distant time.—But, interesting as
such labours are, you are capable of things much more valuable than such
mere editorial work. I can not wish that you should leave unfinished
what you have so well begun, but I shall be glad when the time comes to
which you seemed to be looking forward in your last letter, now some
months ago. . . . I hope, before this, you have received the book on
Hamilton, and also the first of two articles which I have written on
Comte’s philosophy. The second article is in print and I expect to be
able to send it to you before it is published in England. I shall be
well content if you are half as well pleased with these as you are sure
to be with Mr. Grote’s book on Plato. This is nearly all printed, and I
have read most of it; and both in point of learning and of thought it
comes up to my highest expectations. It can not, I think, fail to
produce a great effect in Germany, where the thoroughness of his
knowledge of the subject will be much better appreciated than by an
unlearned public, which can only take it on trust . . . .

Dear Sir—

I noticed the discrepancy between the price mentioned in the agreement &
those advertised,2 but supposed that it was intentional & that you
Edition: current; Page: [1041] thought it advantageous to begin at once
with the lower price. I would make any sacrifice rather than consent to
fixing the price of the Pol. Ec. higher than the one announced, as it
would look like breaking faith with the public. But I feel the same
objection as before to binding myself by a permanent engagement which
would prevent the plates from ever returning to me. I am most willing
that you should retain as many copies beyond the 8000 as will indemnify
you for what you would otherwise lose by your mistake. The loss being
2/6 on each of 4000 copies, 2000 copies additional at 5/- would
compensate you for this, but would leave you losers by the paper & press
work of the 2000 & for that I am ready to add as many more copies as you
think sufficient to indemnify you, leaving the stipulation about the
subsequent sale as it already stands, viz, that you should continue to
publish the editions at half profit for five years after the sale of the
whole number of copies agreed on.

I am glad to hear so good an account of the sale.3 I suppose the 400
copies sold of Hamilton are chiefly the trade subscription.4 The Logic
will require an unusual amount of revision for the new edition,5 & I
will take it in hand as soon as I can, but as this can hardly be before
my next return to England, I will ask you to send the sheets to
Blackheath Park rather than here.

I was not aware that you had been asked to allow your name to appear as
one of my supporters for Westminster, and I beg that you will not
consent unless, on public grounds, you prefer me to any other candidate
likely to be proposed. I should be much honoured by your doing so, but
if you do not I hope you do not think that it can have any influence on
my personal sentiments towards yourself.

Lincoln is a glorious martyr if ever there was one. He is not to be

ruffianly assassin had deprived one of a dear personal friend. I do not
believe the cause will suffer. It may even gain, by the indignation
excited. There was real danger lest the North, and Lincoln himself,

Dear Sir—

I have just received your letter, dated 25th Feby.

It is a great compliment to me that my supposed opinions should have had
the influence you ascribe to them in Australia.2 But there seems to have
been a considerable degree of misunderstanding about what they are. The
fault probably lies with myself, in not having explained them
sufficiently. I have entered rather more fully into the subject in the
new editions published this spring. But, not to give you the trouble of
referring to them, I can have no difficulty in saying that I never for a
moment thought of recommending or countenancing, in a new colony more
than elsewhere, a general protective policy, or a system of duties on
imported commodities such as that which has recently passed the
representative assembly of your colony. What I had in view was this. If
there is some particular branch of industry, not hitherto carried on in
the country, but which individuals or associations, possessed of the
necessary capital, are ready & desirous to naturalize: & if these
persons can satisfy the legislature that after their workpeople are
fully trained, & the difficulties of the first introduction surmounted
they shall probably be able to produce the article as cheap or cheaper
than the price at which it can be Edition: current; Page: [1044]
imported, but that they cannot do so without the temporary aid either of
a subsidy from the Govt or of a protecting duty: Then it may sometimes
be a good calculation for the future interests of the country to make a
temporary sacrifice, by granting a moderate protecting duty for a
certain limited number of years, say ten, or at the very most twenty,
during the latter part of which the duty should be on a gradually
diminishing scale, & at the end of which it should expire. You see how
far this doctrine is from supporting the fabric of Protectionist
doctrine, in behalf of which its aid has been invoked.

Your wish respectg a cheap edition of the little book on Liberty has
already been fulfilled. It is now on sale at 1/4 & my Pol. Econ. & Rep.
Govt at prices proportionally even lower 5/ & 2/.

The universality of the feeling occasioned by Lincoln’s catastrophe is a
good sign of our common humanity, for it is, in most cases, genuine

considered happy in his death—quite otherwise than if he had died before
the decisive triumph. There cannot be a more glorious fate than to die
so mourned by a whole people—to have become so dear to them through the
best part of their character exclusively. I agree with you in having no
fear of public mischief from his loss. It will perhaps, on the contrary,
prevent a great deal of weak indulgence towards the slaveholding class,
whose power it is necessary should be completely and permanently broken
at all costs. Meanwhile the effect is admirable in Continental Europe
(England does not need that particular lesson) of the example of power
passing by course of law, without a dream of opposition in the freest
country in the world.

From what you say, the Lucas who is dead2 must be the younger brother of
Frederic Lucas. I was slightly acquainted with him formerly, but had
lost sight of him. I suppose he died of heart disease like his
brother—more fortunate than he in dying without a long illness.

Pray thank Mrs Hickson and Miss Grant3 for their kind remembrances.

Je voudrais bien, mon cher d’Eichthal, pouvoir répondre à votre lettre,
comme M. Blackie,2 par une lettre en grec: Πολλου̑ γε καὶ δει̑; ἐπεὶ
παντὸς μα̑λλον, ὤ ϕίλε, βουλοίμην ἄν.3 Assurément la nation grecque vous
doit de la reconnaissance, ainsi que, en second lieu, à M. Duruy.4 Du
reste, elle me semble déjà bien avancée dans le chemin de la
restauration grammaticale de son ancienne langue. Jugez de ma
satisfaction quand j’ai vu, dans la redaction de sa nouvelle
Constitution,5 qu’elle avait repris possession complète du cas datif.
Après cela il ne lui reste guère à reprendre que l’infinitif, chose très
importante, mais nullement plus difficile à regagner.

Votre nouvelle brochure6 ne m’est pas encore parvenue, mais un paquet va
venir qui la contiendra. Je tâcherai de faire en sorte qu’il soit
question de toutes les deux, non seulement dans la Revue de
Westminster,7 mais peut-être ailleurs.

Nous avons un fort bon livre anglais sur la prononciation de la langue
grecque, par un nommé Pennington,8 dans lequel il est à peu près
démontré que les anciens Grecs prononçaient leur langue d’une manière
peu éloignée Edition: current; Page: [1046] de celle des Grecs
d’aujourd’hui. Je n’ai pas un exemplaire de ce livre, et je crois qu’il
se trouve difficilement, si ce n’est dans les bibliothèques publiques;
sans cela je vous l’aurais envoyé. C’est le sécrétaire du gouvernement
anglais des îles Ioniennes qui me le fit lire en 1855.9

J’essaierai de vous voir en traversant Paris en deux mois d’ici, bien
que je n’y compte rester que quelques heures.

Avez-vous vu l’article du dernier numéro de la Revue de Westminster sur
l’Evangile de Saint-Jean? Il ne vous offre probablement rien de nouveau,
puisqu’il se donne comme résumé des travaux de l’école de Tubingue.10

Bien des salutations à votre frère et à Duveyrier,

Cher monsieur—

La seconde partie de mon travail sur M. Comte ne sera publiée que le 1er
juillet mais on a promis de me donner bientôt des exemplaires séparés.
Il vous en sera expédié cinq, destinés comme auparavant pour vous même,
pour le traducteur,2 pour Mme Comte, pour M. de Blignières et pour M.
Taine. Il est très naturel que vous n’approuviez pas sans réserve tout
ce que j’ai dit dans la 1re partie. Ce que votre livre a montré d’accord
entre nos jugements est encore plus que je n’osais espérer. Une critique
de ma critique, faite de votre point de vue, m’intéresserait grandement,
et ce serait une bonne fortune pour moi si vous pouviez avoir le temps
de vous en occuper.3

Quant au livre sur Hamilton c’est en grande partie une oeuvre de
circonstance, comme le doit être tout livre de polémique—mais avec
quelques chapitres de psychologie positive. Ce que ce livre a de mieux
c’est qu’il porte Edition: current; Page: [1047] la guerre dans le camp
ennemi. Aussi je crois que les métaphysiciens de l’école éclectique et
allemande ne me le pardonneront pas.

Si un journal a dit que je sollicite des électeurs, ce journal se
trompe: ce sont des électeurs qui m’ont sollicité. On m’a porté candidat
presque malgré moi. J’ai refusé de rien faire de ce que font
ordinairement chez nous les candidats. Je n’ai fait que ce qu’ils ne
font guère c. à. d. une profession de foi parfaitement sincère. Au reste
je pense avec M. Comte que, sauf des circonstances exceptionelles et
transitoires, la place des philosophes n’est pas dans le gouvernement,
et malgré mes 35 ans des fonctions administratives je ne me regarde pas
comme une exception. Vous savez que dans l’idée que je me fais des
assemblées délibérantes, elles doivent être un lieu de discussion plutôt
que d’action, et si je consentais à y siéger ce serait pour n’y exercer
qu’un pouvoir spirituel. P. L. Courier4 disait que, presque seul parmi
les Français, il ne voulait pas être roi: si l’on me nommait à la
chambre j’y serais probablement le seul député qui ne voudrait pas être
ministre.

Dear Mr Maurice—

I was already so well aware of your kind feelings towards me that even
such a letter as I have just received from you hardly increases my sense
of them. I most sincerely feel towards you & your work in life, the full
equivalent of all which you so kindly express. I never voluntarily leave
unread any of your writings & if I have not more frequently offered you
any of mine it was because I seldom felt confident that what you would
approve in them, would outweigh what you would disapprove. I knew
however that there was much in my new book2 with which you would fully
sympathize, greatly as I know you differ from the metaphysical doctrines
contained in it. You were continually in my thoughts when I wrote the
chapter against Mansel3 and your controversy with him contributed much
towards stirring me up to write the book.

Edition: current; Page: [1048]
I sympathize with the feeling of (if I may so call it) mental loneliness
which shews itself in your letter & sometimes in your published
writings. In our age & country, every person with any mental power at
all, who both thinks for himself & has a conscience, must feel himself,
to a very great degree, alone. I shd think you have decidedly more
people who are in real communion of thoughts, feelings & purposes with
you than I have. I am in this supremely happy, that I have had, & even
now have, that communion in the fullest degree where it is most valuable
of all, in my own home. But I have it nowhere else; & if people did but
know how much more precious to me is the faintest approach to it, than
all the noisy eulogiums in the world! The sole value to me of these is
that they dispose a greater number of people to listen to what I am able
to say to them; & they are an admonition to me to make as much of that
kind of hay as I can before the sun gives over shining. What is
happening just now is the coming to the surface of a good deal of
influence which I had been insensibly acquiring without knowing it; &
there are to me many signs that you are exercising a very considerable
influence of the same kind, though you yourself seem to think the
contrary.

Dear Sir

I have to thank you for a great many more cuttings, which were extremely
interesting to me, and on the whole very satisfactory, for those of my
opinions which are thought to be most out of the common way seemed to
obtain fair consideration, and to be found not so bad as they look. I
was amused with your friend’s letter, especially with his idea that the
male voters need the ballot to protect them against their wives. I
think, myself, that the privilege of the vote gives an advantage not
only to a bad husband over the wife, but to the wife over a kind
husband, for he thinks he ought to defer more or less to her, on account
of his voting as the representative of both. If she had a vote of her
own, she would not have so much power of interfering with his.

Your friend should reconsider his opinion on representation of
minorities. Cobden’s answer2 is no answer at all; for in his plan, of
having as many constituencies as there are members, a minority of each
would still be unrepresented. On Mr Hare’s plan, no one need be
unrepresented, since the electoral body would divide of itself into
unanimous constituencies.

With our kind remembrances to Mrs Plummer

TO EDWIN CHADWICK1

Saint Véran, Avignon

May 15. 1865

Dear Chadwick

I have been so very busy, and have had, besides, so many letters to
write, that I am very tardy in replying to your interesting letter of
April 29. We were greatly amused by the “election humours” which it
communicates, and by the comments you report on the injudiciousness of
my second letter.2 I do Edition: current; Page: [1050] not wonder that
people should think it injudicious if they suppose that my grand object
in the whole matter is to get myself elected. But as the only purpose
for which I care to be elected is to get my opinions listened to, it
would have been very “injudicious” in me to forego so good an
opportunity of that, for fear that it should damage my election. I have
gained this by it, that what are thought the most out of the way of all
my opinions, have been, and are, discussed and canvassed from one end of
the country to the other, and some of them (especially women’s voting)
are obtaining many unexpected adhesions. I reckon this a good stroke of
practicality, whether I am elected for Westminster or not.

As to the election itself, I had much rather you were elected than I,
and if I could transfer my supporters in a body to you, I would do so
instantly. I suspect, however, that the thing will be taken out of our
hands. The appearance in the field of the illustrious man3 whom the
Tories have put forward as the representative of the intelligent classes
against popular ignorance, as embodied in me, will probably produce a
general demand that one of the professedly liberal candidates should be
withdrawn; and perhaps the appeal to the individual electors by
circular, which we have contended for, will be made for the inferior
purpose of ascertaining who ought to retire. I do not think the Tories
expect their man to come in, otherwise some more considerable person
would have started in that interest. But they are glad when anybody with
money to spend, is willing to venture it on the chance.

I feel for Sir Edw. Lytton,4 who expected to get some credit from my
friends by the expression of his good wishes (which were very likely
sincere) but found he had come across a man who had the peculiarity of
expecting that people should act up to what they say. I should have
thought more highly of him if he had said plainly, “These are my private
sentiments, but I must go with my party”, a feeling which, as men go, is
very excusable. Lord Amberley,5 I am glad to see, has a higher standard.
It is really a fine thing in him to have withdrawn from Grosvenor’s
Committee and come over to me.6

It is an agreeable surprise to me that Mr Westerton should have been so
favourably impressed by the “Liberty”. I give him very great credit for
it. It shews that his view of religion is a much higher and better one
than is at all Edition: current; Page: [1051] common. Had I listened to
commonplace notions of “practicality,” I should never have published
that book; yet its publication does not seem to do me any practical
harm.

As to the application you have received about having my likeness taken
for publication, I have a real difficulty about it, owing to having
refused my photograph to friends who much wished for it. If it should be
necessary, however, there is a cameo likeness of me,7 from which a copy
could be taken; but it cannot be till we return.

ever yours truly

J. S. Mill

P.S. I have just received your packet of printed documents. The list of
the Committee is very good: there are some names on it which I am glad
to see, but was afraid would be wanting.

TO PARKE GODWIN1

May 15. 1865

Dear Sir—

I had scarcely received your note of April 82 so full of calm joy in the
splendid prospect now opening to your country & through it to the world;
when the news came that an atrocious crime had struck down the great
citizen who had afforded so noble an example of the qualities befitting
the first magistrate of a free people & who in the most trying
circumstances had gradually won not only the admiration but almost the
personal affection of all who love freedom & appreciate simplicity &
uprightness. But the loss is ours, not his. It was impossible to have
wished him a better end than to add the crown of martyrdom to his other
honours & to live in the memory of a great nation as those only live who
have not only laboured for their country but died for it. And he did
live to see the cause triumphant & the contest virtually over. How
different would our feelings now be if this fate had overtaken him as it
might so easily have done, a month sooner!

In England, horror of the crime & sympathy with your loss seem to be
almost universal, even among those who have disgraced their country by
wishing success to the slaveholders. I hope the manifestations which
were instantaneously made there in almost every quarter may be received
in Edition: current; Page: [1052] America as some kind of atonement or
peace-offering. I have never believed that there was any real danger of
a quarrel between the two countries but it is of immense importance that
we should be firm friends; & this is our natural state; for though there
is a portion of the higher & middle classes of Great Britain who so
dread & hate democracy that they cannot wish prosperity or power to a
democratic people, I firmly believe that this feeling is not general
even in our privileged classes. Most of the dislike & suspicion which
have existed towards the U.S. were the effect of pure ignorance;
ignorance of your history, & ignorance of your feelings & disposition as
a people. It is difficult for you to believe that this ignorance could
be as dense as it really was. But the late events have begun to
dissipate it, & if your Government & people act as I fully believe they
will, in regard to the important questions which now await them there
will be no fear of their being ever again so grossly misunderstood, at
least in the lives of the present generation.

As to the mode of dealing with these great questions, it does not become
a foreigner to advise those who know the exigencies of the case so much
better than he does. But as so many of my countrymen are volunteering
advice to you at this crisis perhaps I may be forgiven if I offer mine
the contrary way. Every one is vaguely inculcating gentleness, and only
gentleness, as if you had shown any signs of disposition to take a
savage revenge. I have always been afraid of one thing only, that you
would be too gentle. I shd be very sorry to see any life taken after the
war is over (except those of the assassins) or any evil inflicted in
mere vengeance; but one thing I hope will be considered absolutely
necessary: to break altogether the power of the slaveholding caste.
Unless this is done, the abolition of slavery will be merely nominal. If
an aristocracy of ex-slaveholders remain masters of the State
legislatures they will be able effectually to nullify a great part of
the result which has been so dearly bought by the blood of the Free
States. They & their dependents must be effectually outnumbered at the
polling-places: which can only be effected by the concession of full
equality of political rights to negroes & by a large immigration of
settlers from the North, both of them being made independent by the
ownership of land. With these things in addition to the constitutional
amendment3 (which will enable the Supreme Court to set aside any State
legislation tending to bring back slavery in disguise) the cause of
freedom is safe & the opening words of the Declaration of Independence
will cease to be a reproach to the nation founded by its authors.

I doubt not that you have by this time received from Mr Hare the new
edition of his book. I do not know if Mr Fawcett has fulfilled his
intention of sending you his pamphlet,4 but as Mr Hare has adopted the
simplifications Edition: current; Page: [1053] which Mr Fawcett
proposed, you will be under no necessity of learning them from any other
source. I am,

Mon cher d’Eichthal

Merci de votre brochure sur “l’usage pratique de la langue grecque comme
langue internationale”2 et des deux journaux grecs de Trieste.3 La
première me fait désirer la complétion de l’ouvrage dont elle forme le
commencement. Edition: current; Page: [1054] Les derniers montrent bien
l’enthousiasme que votre proposition excite très naturellement chez les
esprits Helléniques. Je lis assez facilement le Grec moderne, à quoi, en
effet, il suffit de posséder une certaine connaissance de la langue
ancienne, et d’avoir lu une grammaire quelconque de la moderne: car,
dans le vocabulaire, toute ce qui n’est pas grec ancien est une
imitation assez drôle des mots occidentaux et surtout français. Je n’ai
jamais ri de meilleur coeur que lorsqu’à ma première visite à la poste
aux lettres d’Athènes, je vis devant moi une affiche commençant par ces
mots: Ἡ γενικη διευθυνσις τω̑ Ἑλληνικων ἀτμοσκαϕειων Ἐιδοποιει̑.4

Je trouve l’article de Littré5 fort bon, et votre lettre dans la Clio6
excellente. Ce serait, sans doute, difficile de faire dans la langue
ordinaire la restauration grammaticale que vous proposez. Mais après
tout ce que les Grecs ont déjà fait dans ce genre, il ne faut désespérer
de rien. D’ailleurs l’instruction que reçoivent à peu près tous les
enfants (au moins mâles) dans l’ancienne langue, rend ces changements
beaucoup moins difficiles, puisque les formes restaurées seraient tout
d’abord comprises.

Je vous renverrai les journaux, qui pourront vous servir encore pour la
propagande.

Je ne connais M. Blackie7 que par son réputation et par quelques-uns de
ses écrits. J’ai remarqué avec plaisir les succès parlementaires de
Lanjuinais.8

Ce serait une bonne fortune pour moi que de vous voir à Avignon: mais,
pour le moment, je n’en ai guère l’espoir; car je me propose de partir
en cinq jours pour une tournée dans les Cévennes et en Auvergne, après
quoi je ne serai ici que pendant deux ou trois jours au commencement de
juillet avant de partir pour l’Angleterre, où je passe habituellement la
moitié de l’année. L’élection de Westminster n’est pour rien dans mon
retour. Cette élection se fait absolument sans moi.9 Je ne compte pas du
tout sur le succès, mais s’il arrive, il en sera d’autant plus honorable
pour moi et pour les électeurs.

Je vous serre la main.

TO EDWIN L. GODKIN1

May 24, 1865

Dear Sir

I thank you very sincerely for your article in the North American
Review;2 not merely for sending it to me, but for writing it. I consider
it a very important contribution to the philosophy of the subject; a
correction, from one point of view of what was excessive in
Tocqueville’s theory of democracy, as my review of him was from another.
You have fully made out that the peculiar character of society in the
Western States—the mental type formed by the position and habits of the
Pioneers—is at least in part accountable for many American phenomena
which have been ascribed to democracy. This is a most consoling belief,
as it refers the unfavourable side of American social existence (which
you set forth with a fulness of candour that ought to shame the
detractors of American literature and thought) to causes naturally
declining, rather than to one which always tends to increase.

But if any encouragement were required by those who hope the best from
American institutions, the New England States as they now are, would be
encouragement enough. If Tocqueville had lived to know what those states
have become, thirty years after he saw them, he would, I think, have
acknowledged that much of the unfavourable part of his anticipations had
not been realized. Democracy has been no leveller there, as to intellect
and education, or respect for true personal superiority. Nor has it
stereotyped a particular cast of thought; as is proved by so many really
original writers, yourself being one. Finally, New England has now the
immortal glory of having destroyed Slavery; to do which has required an
amount of high principle, courage, and energy, which few other
communities, either monarchial or republican, have ever displayed. And
the great concussion which has taken place in the American mind, must
have loosened the foundations of all prejudices, Edition: current; Page:
[1056] and secured a fair hearing for impartial reason on all subjects,
such as it might not otherwise have had for many generations.

It is a happiness to have lived to see such a termination of the
greatest and most corrupting of all social iniquities—which, more than
all other causes together, lowered the tone of the national and
especially the political mind of the United States. It now rests with
the intellect and high aspirations of the Eastern States, and the energy
and straightforward honesty of the Western, to make the best use of the
occasion, and I have no misgiving as to the result.

Do not trouble yourself to send me the North American Review, as I
already subscribe to it. But I shall always be glad to be informed of
any article in it which is of your writing, and to know your opinion on
any American question.

far as it is directed against Sir W. Hamilton; which is fully as much
approbation as I could hope for; & it was pleasant to be told that there

Dear Sir

It seems a very long time since I either heard from you or wrote to you,
and you may have thought it strange that I did not write on a subject of
such deeply tragical interest to us both as the assassination of
Lincoln. But I felt it necessary to express my feelings on that
catastrophe to so many persons,2 Americans and others, who could not
otherwise have known them, that I felt less prompted than usual to give
vent to them, to those who would know and judge of them by their own.
What I now principally feel is that the death of Lincoln, like that of
Socrates, is a worthy end to a noble life, and puts the seal of
universal remembrance upon his worth. He has now a place among the great
names of history, and one could have wished nothing better for him
personally than to die almost or quite unconsciously, in perhaps the
happiest hour of his life. How one rejoices that he lived to know of
Lee’s surrender.

At present I am chiefly anxious that the Americans may not do themselves
any damage in the matter of Jefferson Davis.3 I do not like the trial of
the assassins by martial law. If they try Davis in that manner, and
convict him, let him be ever so guilty, the world will never believe
that he had a fair trial. I have good hopes, however, from the
favourable opinion of Johnson4 expressed by men who have the means of
knowing him.

I was happy to see your name in full, attached to your excellent article
on Lowe’s speech.5 There were several very good things in the last
number: Edition: current; Page: [1058] the leader, by Huxley,6
particularly so, notwithstanding what I venture to think heretical
physiology, which, however, he clearly sees, and as clearly shews, not
to affect in the smallest degree the moral, political, or educational
questions, either as regards negroes or women. I wish, however, that the
Reader did not cultivate a tone of flippant attack, often on very
slender grounds which is infinitely more offensive than damaging to the
persons attacked. The Saturday Review, with much more real matter,
manages these things much better. Do you know the editor?7 He seems to
me to be amenable to good influences, and worth cultivating.

We propose setting out in two or three days for an excursion in the
central mountains of France, but letters will from time to time be
forwarded to me from here. I shall be in England in time for the July

required and where I shall hope to see you. If you write, pray tell me

Dear Chadwick

You have indeed a fine list of occupations for any one to carry on pari
passu with his election to Parliament. But your power of work seems
unlimited.

The request of the Committee2 places me in a considerable embarrassment.
What they propose is in itself perfectly reasonable; and any one who
comes forward and proposes himself as a candidate, ought to be willing
to meet the Committee and the Electors in the way they propose, as often
as they think desirable. But I have never, from the beginning, been in
the position of one who offers himself as a candidate. In my first
letter3 I disclaimed doing so; I said that my personal inclination was
against going into Parliament; but that Edition: current; Page: [1059]
if the electors of Westminster nevertheless did me the great honour of
choosing me, I would do my best to serve them, and would answer
unreservedly any number of questions respecting my political opinions,
which might be put to me by or in behalf of any body of electors. My
candidature went forth to the public on this footing; and this
declaration seemed to be one of the causes of the feeling so widely
expressed in favour of the candidature. If I were now to attend meetings
and make speeches to the electors in the usual, and, in most cases, very
proper manner, it would seem as if there had been no truth in my
declaration that I did not personally seek to be in Parliament; as if I
had merely been finessing to get myself elected without trouble and
expense, and having found more difficulty than I expected, had at last
shewn myself in my true colours, rather than run the risk of losing the
election.

If you will kindly represent these things to the Committee, they will, I
hope, enter into the difficulty I feel. If they think that any further
explanation of my opinions would be desirable, they have only to ask for
it. If Mr Beal, or Mr Westerton, or any other member of the Committee,
will write to me, asking my opinion on any new points, or the reasons
and justification of my opinion on any of those on which it has been
already asked and given, I shall have the greatest pleasure in
satisfying them.

In the same manner, I shall be happy to reprint any of my articles which
the Committee may propose. I cannot, however, remember any that would be
much to the purpose, as the political articles are mostly on gone-by
politics. I should be very happy to reprint the article on
“Enfranchisement of Women,”4 but it must be as my wife’s, not as mine.

I am glad to hear what you tell me concerning Mr M’Clean.5 In addition
to his very handsome subscription, he has lately sent me two polite
invitations in his capacity of President of the Institution of Civil
Engineers, and I was desirous to know how I had acquired so much of his
good will.

Any writing by Tories, nominally in my favour, is of no consequence. The
Tories prefer anybody to a regular government man, as they suppose
Grosvenor to be.6 Any one who is not a pledged member of the ministerial
party, they hope may now and then give them a stray vote. But if I were
elected I should hope to be a much greater thorn in their side than a
member of the old Whig connexion can be.

Dear Sir

It is a long time since I wrote to you: indeed, from a variety of
causes. I have had so many more letters to write to total or comparative
strangers than I ever wrote in the same time before, that writing to my
real friends has been put off. I have not, however, been inattentive to
what you have been doing meanwhile. The Social Science meeting2
evidently gave a push onward to Personal Representation, and you have
followed it up in the Daily News with vigour and effect.3 The question
has for the first time passed into the domain of popular discussion, and
is making unexpected proselytes. You must have noted Lubbock’s4
qualified and Hughes’5 distinct adhesion in their electoral addresses.
Perhaps you may not have observed a letter from Francis Newman,6 giving
reasons for and against supporting my candidature, in which my adherence
to your plan is placed among the foremost of the reasons for supporting
me. There are also articles in some of the country papers, shewing that
the plan is obtaining favour in proportion as it becomes known. In
addition to which, my Westminster supporters are all busy finding what
they can say to defend their candidate on the points of representation
of minorities and women’s suffrage. Certainly this election affair is a
better propaganda for all my political opinions than I might have
obtained for many years; and Edition: current; Page: [1061] it is
selling my cheap editions, and indeed the dear ones too, in a most
splendid manner.

My occupation here, except letter-writing, has been of a kind very
remote from these interests, being chiefly that of reading Plato, with a
view to reviewing Grote’s new book.7 I do not find that this by any
means quickens my zeal in my own cause, as a candidate. It is an
infinitely pleasanter mode of spending May to read the Gorgias and
Theatetus under the avenue of mulberries which you know of, surrounded
by roses and nightingales, than it would be to listen to tiresome
speaking for half the night in the House of Commons. The only
disagreeable thing here is having to choose between pleasures: thus we
are about to tear ourselves away from this most enjoyable place to make
a tour in the Cevennes and Auvergne, beginning at Alais, and going round
by Le Vigun, the Lozère, the Cantal, and Mont Dore, to Clermont. We
expect much pleasure from this, but we give up so much pleasure by not
remaining here, that did we not think it useful to health, I do not
believe we could either of us make up our minds to it.

I shall be back for the July meeting of the Club, where I shall hope to
see you. I am glad to see that Gladstone is to be chosen a member.8

With our kind regards to all your family

Dear Sir

Nothing can be more agreeable to me than to hear that you are going to
answer me in the Fortnightly Review.2 I hope you will not spare me. If
you make out so strong a case (and no one is more likely to do so if it
can be done) as to make it absolutely necessary for me to defend myself,
I shall perhaps do so through the same Review; but not without a
positive necessity. I have had enough, for the present, of writing
against a friend and ally.

Edition: current; Page: [1062]
With regard to the Reader, I like the plan of full signatures. I am glad
to see that my friend Professor Cairnes has adopted it, & I should be
glad if it were the common practice. But, to admit of this, it would be
necessary for the Reader to give up the plan it has recently adopted of
making slashing attacks to the right and left, with very insufficient
production of evidence to justify the vituperation: and in a manner
which gives to an indifferent spectator the impression either of
personal ill will in the particular case, or of general flippancy and
dogmatism. Contributors will not like to identify themselves by name
with a publication which would embroil them with an unlimited number of
angry and vindictive writers together with their friends and their
publishers. I myself should not like to be supposed to be in any way
connected, for instance, with the attack on the Edinburgh Review3 (for
which I am at this very time preparing an article)—an attack of which I
wholly dislike the tone, and agree only partially with the substance;
and it happens that the article singled out from the last number for
special contempt,4 my name too being cited against it, is by a personal
friend of my own, a man of very considerable merit, whom I was desirous
of securing as a recruit for the Reader—and who is very naturally hurt
and indignant at the treatment of him. I am by no means against severity
in criticism, but the more it is severe, the more it needs to be well
weighed and justly distributed. I have represented a good deal of this
to Mr. Rae,5 with whom I am in correspondence, and of whom in other
respects I have formed a very favourable impression. He has very much
improved the Reader, and is improving it more and more; and but for that
one fault it bids fair to justify our original hopes.

Dear Sir—

I have not written to you since I came here, having from various causes
been so overwhelmed with letter writing that I was obliged to Edition:
current; Page: [1063] adjourn all of it that admitted of postponement. I
now write though I have not anything very particular to say, except that
I am going to leave Avignon for a tour in the Cevennes & Auvergne &
though letters will be sent to me from here, they will not reach me so
soon or so certainly as at present. It seems to me that discussion on
the fundamental points of representative government & especially on the
points raised in my Westminster letters, is going on very satisfactorily
at present. Numbers of country papers are sent to me in which Hare’s
system, repr of minorities, in all its shapes, and women’s suffrage are
mooted—sometimes with approbation, & often (especially as to women’s
suffrage) with much less hostility than was to be expected. You have
probably seen Mr. Hughes’ declaration in favour of Hare’s system2 &
Francis Newman’s commendation of me for adhering to it.3 The cheaper
editions also are going off at a wonderful rate & even the dear ones are
increasing in sale. These are substantial advantages derived from the
Westr contest whether it succeeds or not. I think it hardly possible
that it should succeed. Though it has brought to light a most unexpected
amount of good feeling by isolated individuals towards me personally,
there is no set of political men who really wish to have me in Parlt:
neither Whigs, nor Tories, nor the Bright radicals (though I hear that
B. himself speaks in my favour), nor any other set of radicals except
perhaps the Cooperative section of the working classes. Look at the list
of subscribers for the election expenses: next to none of them are
representative men. They are people from here, there, & everywhere who
have happened to like my books. Many even who for personal reasons might
have subscribed, hold back, evidently because their sets are hostile to
me. This is what I always said would be the case. As Comte says, “tout
ce qui est aujourd’hui classé” is sure to be hostile to really new
ideas—a little shuffling of the cards is all they want.4

But enough of this. I am full of joy & spirits for the glorious future
of America. The catastrophe of Lincoln though it was a great shock, does
not cloud the prospect. How could one have wished him a happier death?
He died almost unconsciously, in the fulness of success, & martyrdom in
so great a cause consecrates his name through all history. Such a death
is the crown of a noble life.

The author of the paper “Nurses Wanted”2 offers an article on a very
different subject, a notice of the new (and much improved) edition of Mr
Hare’s book on Representation. The article3 is strongly in favour of Mr
Hare’s system; which I suppose you do not object to, especially as any
other contributor is free to take the opposite side. I think the writer
brings out some important points very well, and will give an impression
of novelty in the mode of treatment.

Your remark2 is most just on the unworthiness of the conversions due
only to success. Such conversions merely show the fundamental
unworthiness of the original error. The disgust they occasion is one of
the causes which make those who have fought an up-hill battle up to the
hour of victory eager to go forward to something else, in which they
will still have the low-minded and selfish part of mankind against them.

June 7, 1865

Dear Sir

I am writing to you from a little place in the mountains of Central
France, where we are making a short excursion. I have not liked to write
until I had read your treatise on Freewill.2 I have now done so, with
great admiration in many respects, but I am unable to say that it has
made any alteration in my opinion. It is very clearly thought and
expressed, and draws some metaphysical distinctions which though quite
correct are often disregarded, for instance, that fundamental one
between volition and choice. There is great acuteness too in much of the
polemic with Edwards,3 though I think that he might have found much to
say in reply to it, and that you have sometimes refuted rather his
expressions than his thoughts. But I do not find that your arguments in
any way touch the doctrine of so-called Necessity as I hold it. You
allow that volition requires the previous existence of two things, which
the mind itself did not make, at least directly, nor, in most cases, at
all: a knowledge, and a want. You consider as the peculiarity of a free
cause, that its determinations do not depend on the past, but on a
preconception of the future. But though the knowledge and the want refer
to what is future, the knowledge and the want themselves are not future
facts, but present, or rather past, facts, for they must exist previous
to the volitional act. You seem to admit not only that the knowledge and
want are conditions precedent to the will, but that the character of the
will invariably corresponds to that of the knowledge and want, and that
any variation in either of these determines, or at least is sure to be
followed by, a corresponding variation in the volition. Now this is all
that I, as a necessitarian, require. I do not believe in anything real
corresponding to the phrases Necessity, Causal Force or the like. I
acknowledge no other link between cause and effect, even when both are
purely material, than invariability of sequence, from which arises
possibility of prediction. And this it seems to me, on your own shewing,
exists equally between volitions and the mental antecedents by which you
allow that they are and must be preceded.

My own view of the subject you will find in a chapter of my book on Sir
William Hamilton,4 which I hope reached you, and to which I must refer
Edition: current; Page: [1066] you for the arguments I have not room for
here. Let me add, however, that on the subject, practically considered,
I am at one with you. Your view of what the mind has power to do, seems
to me quite just: but we differ on the question, how the mind is
determined to do it.5

To turn to another subject, no less interesting to us both; you seem to
have now a finance minister who understands currency,6 and the close of
the war will render return to the right path comparatively easy. I look
forward to the brightest future for America now, provided the North is
not foolishly generous to its conquered enemies. It is quite
indispensable to break the power of the Slaveholding oligarchy.
Emancipation is not enough, without making the freed negroes electors
and landholders, nor without reinforcing them by a large migration of
northern people into the southern states. Otherwise the negroes will
remain in a state of dependence on their old masters approaching to
slavery, and both they and the mean whites will be kept ignorant and
brutish as they have been kept hitherto. I would not shrink from
extensive confiscation if it were necessary for these purposes, but
doubtless the impoverishment of the great landholders, and their disgust
with the new state of things, will cause a great number of the large
estates to be sold and broken up, a thing eminently desirable. Probably
the indignation of your whole people at the atrocious crime which robbed
the world of your noble President, added to the known opinions and
determined character of his successor, may tend to diminish the risk of
any undue indulgence being shown to those who, like dethroned despots,
will be always hankering after their lost power. It is only the next
generation of them who can possibly become true citizens of a free
nation.

Dear Chadwick

I am extremely sorry that your two letters were not answered
immediately, owing to their having arrived a day or two after we had set
out on an excursion Edition: current; Page: [1067] in the mountains.
They have been forwarded to me here, along with a letter from Mr Beal,
to whom I have by this post sent a reply, which he will no doubt
communicate to you. I have told him that I am decidedly for proceeding
in the way first proposed,2 and submitting your name to the electors
with those of all the candidates, and that it would not be just to you
to ask you to forgo such claims as you possess, without having laid them
before the electors and obtained their decision. The talk about dividing
the liberal interest is quite inapplicable to the course proposed, in
which it is implied that neither you nor I will be nominated if the
result of the appeal to the electors shews that we have fewer supporters
than Grosvenor and Smith. I need not repeat what my own wishes are, and
that I would much rather you were elected than myself. But that is not
the question: it is for the electors to shew their preference, and for
us, or rather our supporters, to withdraw our names if any other
candidates in the liberal interest are preferred to us.

I have revised your address,3 not as to matter, but as to style, in
which it was very defective, and sometimes even unintelligible, from
haste. The contents of it (and it is an understatement of your public
services) ought to suffice for your election by any constituency in the
country. If the public were not so much inured to seeing any petty
consideration prevail over personal fitness they would feel it a
national disgrace that you are not in Parliament.

TO GEORGE GROTE1

My dear Grote

Many thanks for the two sheets, which were waiting for me at Mende along
with your letter. The chapter on the Leges2 is less interesting than
most of the others, because the subject is less so: its inferiority, in
fact, was the main point to bring out. The two concluding chapters,3 on
the other hand, are equal in interest to almost anything in the work;
especially the account of the Megarics, Edition: current; Page: [1068]
Kyrenaics &c. of whom I previously knew very little. I hope to be able
to make a useful article on the book:4 but when I spoke of giving an
intellectual outline of Plato from your materials, I meant from your
thoughts: not that I had attained any higher point of view than yours,
but that I hoped to reproduce yours in a condensed form.

I hope you have seen Mark Pattison’s review of you in the Reader.5 He
contests the question of the Platonic canon with you, or rather,
promises to contest it. I fancy he reckons the history of philosophy one
of his own strong points; which it certainly is not, since he can speak
of Aristotle as a mere pupil of Plato. I was pleased, however, as well
as surprised, to find him so eulogistic of the book in every other
respect. He had just before written a review of my Hamilton in which he
equally surprised me by the extent of his adhesion.6

How valuable to me is your approbation of the Hamilton I need not say.
The opinion you express of it comes up to my highest hopes. I have been
amused by some of the discussions respecting it which have been evoked
by the stimulus of the Westminster affair. I learn from the Spectator,7
that the Morning Advertiser8 (à propos of the chapter on Mansel’s
Bampton Lectures)9 declares that I am not only an athetist, but have on
this occasion put forth my atheism in a form the most revolting which
the editor of that paper has ever met with: and the Record10 says I am
the chief of the Satanic School in England at present. The Spectator, on
the contrary, says the principal value of the book is the logical; that
the passages in question are the true language of prophets and apostles:
and in the same number in which it attacks and protests against the
philosophy of the book, makes a hearty and vigorous defence of its
religion: saying at the same time that it has never been able to find
out what my private religious opinions are, and that nobody has any
right to pry into them. All this is pretty much as I expected, and
wished.

I am writing to you from a beautiful place, in the heart of a valley
which is an old crater, surmounted by summits between 6 and 7000 feet
above the sea, though only from 3 to 4000 above the plateau of Central
France. The interior of the crater is filled up with the loveliest
pastures and forests. We have enjoyed our tour very much, and have not
been indulged with a single rainy day, Edition: current; Page: [1069] or
even hour, in which to get on with Plato. I hope to see you in the early
part of next month.

Dear Sir—

I very much regret that your letter and telegraphic message were not
answered as promptly as I should have wished, they having had to be
forwarded to me here. I have no objection whatever to attend meetings of
the Committee, or even of the electors, other than those which I stated
in my answer2 to a letter which Mr Chadwick wrote to me on the subject,
at the request as I understood, of the Committee. But I confess the
reason you now give for desiring me to come over and meet the Committee,
operates on my mind the reverse way. I should never, for my own part,
think of taking any notice of a charge of irreligion brought by the
Record3 or the M. Advertiser.4 They are ready to bring such a charge
against the most pious man in England if he does not agree in their
narrow minded & thoroughly unChristian notions of religion and my
attending a meeting just at present would scarcely promote the purpose
for which you suggest it, since I should positively and deliberately
refuse to allow myself to be interrogated on any subject whatever of
purely religious opinion. I do this on principle. I conceive that no one
has any right to question another on his religious opinions; that the
tree ought to be judged, and only can be judged, by its fruits; and I
hold myself bound, not for my own sake, for it is my practice to speak
my opinions very plainly, but for the sake of future candidates, not to
do any thing that may facilitate raising a religious cry against a
person who may be unassailable as a politician, on evidence extorted
from his own mouth. The case is different as to my expressed opinions.
Whatever I have written and published I stand by, and am ready to
defend; and I defy any one to point out in my writing a single passage
that conflicts with what the best religious minds of our time accept as
Christianity. The passage which, I am informed, the Record and the
Advertiser have Edition: current; Page: [1070] fastened upon, I maintain
to be one of the most religious and Christian expressions of feeling in
all recent literature. I am not alone in this opinion. Among many
others, one of the most eminent of the Bench of Bishops declares in a
letter in the Spectator of June 17,5 that the sentence in question
breathes the purest spirit of Christian morality; and the Spectator
itself (a most religious paper) had said a fortnight before,6 of the
same sentence, that it speaks the true language of Prophets and
Apostles. Such expressions as these it would not become me to use; but I
am not afraid that your judgment, or that of any rational person who
reads the passage and the context fairly, would pronounce it other than
Christian, in the truest sense. I am not aware that Mr Mansel’s
theology7 is the same thing with religion, or that to say that I will
worship no God but a good God is to be an atheist.—You are at full
liberty to make any use you please public or private, of this letter.

Any letter to me had better be addressed to Avignon, as I am about to
return there, and thence very shortly to England.

Dear Sir—

When I wrote to you this morning I had not yet received your letter of
the 17th inst. written in the name of the Committee and requesting a
personal interview. In reply I beg to say that I shall be happy to
attend the Committee on any day they may appoint after I arrive in
England. In the meantime I beg to say that with regard to the plan of
addressing the electors by circular, as on every other matter connected
with the election, it rests with the Committee alone to decide; and I
regard it simply as an additional mark of courtesy and consideration
towards myself, that they should have sought any consultation with me on
the subject. Not taking any of the usual burthens of a candidate, I have
no claim to the privileges of one. It is but reasonable that those who
take all the trouble should freely determine on their own judgment the
course to be pursued. I did not volunteer the proposal of submitting
various names to the constituency, as a suggestion of my own; I
understood it to be included in the original scheme of which my
nomination was a part; and thinking the plan an excellent one, both in
itself and as an Edition: current; Page: [1071] example, I expressed
strongly the approbation which I felt. My opinion on the subject is not
changed; I still think that it would have been highly desirable to adopt
this course in the first instance. The Committee, however, are of
opinion that the time has gone by for it, and that it would not be
suitable to the present state of affairs. They have a perfect right to
act on their own judgment; and were they even to carry courtesy so far
as to postpone their judgment to mine, to accept such an act of
abnegation would be to take the conduct of the election out of their
hands, which I am as little inclined as entitled to do. Any discussion
between us, therefore, on this matter, I regard as merely an affair of
friendly explanation, and not of a practical character. I shall be at
Blackheath Park on the 6th of July,2 and I shall hold myself at the
disposal of the Committee any day and hour afterwards, except the
evening of the 7th for which I have a positive engagement.3

Dear Chadwick

Your letters of the 15th and 16th followed me to Clermont, and along
with them I received an urgent letter from Mr Westerton (with a
telegraphic message which had preceded it) urging emphatically the
necessity of my coming over at once on account of the accusations of
atheism made against me by the Record and the Morning Advertiser.2 I
thought so much sensitiveness to such attacks from such quarters of very
bad augury; and not choosing to submit to being catechized on my
religious belief, I wrote to Mr Westerton as follows: [Here JSM copies
Letter 834].

By the next day’s post I received a further letter from Mr Westerton as
Chairman of the Committee requesting on their part a personal interview
with me for the purpose of explaining to me how they had endeavoured to
adopt my plan (as he called it) of addressing the electors by circular,
and why they were now of opinion that altered circumstances render it
desirable to abandon the plan. I do not see what answer I could give to
this except that it was their affair, not mine; that having been asked
my opinion I had given it, and that it is unchanged; but that I am not a
candidate, and have no right or wish to take the management of the
election into my own hands. I therefore wrote the following letter:
[Here JSM copies Letter 835].

Edition: current; Page: [1072]
My private opinion is, that they made a mess of the matter, and spoiled
their chances of great public good and great honour to themselves, by
not acting on the plan at first; but that they have let the time go by;
that they would stultify themselves by adopting it now, and (especially
after Shelley’s retirement)3 would bring on themselves bitter reproaches
for dividing the liberal interest, which they are not the men to be
capable of facing. My opinion of them is greatly lowered, and I doubt
much if they have it in them to bring in even one candidate. Mr Beal is
evidently not a typical, but a much too favourable specimen of them.

If you decide to start independently, I will subscribe, as I said. I do
not think either of us will be elected. I would at present lay
considerable odds on Grosvenor and Smith.

The details in your letters interest me very much and some of them are
really important, for purposes much beyond this election.

as it is due to those who have taken so much trouble about me that I

therefore be at Blackheath next Friday morning, and shall probably see

Dear Sir

Having been informed by you that a proposal has been received from Capt.
Grosvenor’s Committee, for a personal conference between Capt. Grosvenor
and five members of his Committe on the one part, and myself and five
members of your Committee on the other, to discuss the possibility of

have from the first declared that I am not a candidate, in the ordinary
sense of the term; that I do not offer myself to the electors, but that,
if thought worthy of the honour of being elected, I will do my best to
serve them. To engage personally in a negociation with another
candidate, would be not only to assume the character which I have
disclaimed but to take into my own hands, in a certain degree, the
management of the election. That management must rest, as it has
hitherto done, wholly with your Committee; with whose judgment
respecting the Edition: current; Page: [1074] mode of conduct which most
conduces to the furtherance of the liberal interest, I have neither the
wish nor the right to interfere.

any one had come, as I fully expected, primed with questions out of the

enter upon the subject you mention.4 But as no one said anything about
it, I thought it best to say nothing either. If I should be troubled on
the subject at any of the other meetings I have to attend (which does
not now seem likely) I shall be ready to face the assailants. But

Though I hope you have gone to Evesham, I write to say that when I went
to the meeting yesterday evening,2 the Committee had already come to an
arrangement with Grosvenor’s Committee,3 in the bona fides of which they
seemed to have complete confidence so that there was nothing for me to
do but to acquiesce in it. I had copies made of the draft of my speech,
but as the reports of the previous meeting4 were so satisfactory, I made
no use of them, and those of this morning give me no reason to regret
that I did not. You will have seen in the Daily News, and doubtless in
the Telegraph,5 Edition: current; Page: [1076] the onslaught I made on
the money power. The Times report,6 though otherwise good, has cut down,
or rather cut out, all that related to that subject. I have to speak at
meetings tonight, Saturday, and Monday. Happily Monday’s must be the
last.7 The meeting was very enthusiastic, and every one seemed very
confident. Qui vivra verra. I shall only believe in success when I see
it; and, success or not, shall always regret that the original plan was
not tried. The probable loss of some liberal seats even metropolitan
ones, through too many or bad candidates, will make the liberal managers
see what they ought to have done when it is too late to retrieve the

Dear Sir,—

The suggestion2 you make of an optional secrecy of voting has been made
before, but it has always appeared to me to be liable to all the
objections against the ballot without having its advantages; since an
elector who asked for the ballot would, by doing so, be considered to
declare that he intended to vote in opposition to the influence exerted
over him; and Edition: current; Page: [1077] the influence which is
strong enough to induce him to vote against his convictions would be
strong enough to compel him to give his vote openly as long as he had
the option of doing so. Electors who are tradesmen may be some times
exposed to coercive influence from both sides; but in that case I should
expect that both sides, or at all events the one which thought itself
strongest, would insist on the elector’s voting openly, in order that
they might know whether they could depend on him.

You are at liberty to publish my letter.

Dear Sir—

I have been prevented by much occupation from sooner acknowledging your
letter dated the 14th.

The difficulty which you feel I understand to be this: how is the
opinion that Christianity might have been extinguished by persecution,
compatible with the belief that God intended & preordained that
Christianity should subsist?2 I conceive there is no inconsistency
between the two opinions. If Xtianity would have perished had it been
persecuted in a certain manner, if God had preordained that it shd not
perish, the reasonable inference is that God preordained that it should
not be persecuted in that manner. The preservation of Xtianity thus
brought about would be no “accident” but part of the divine plan.

The relation between means & ends is quite compatible with a
providential government of human affairs. It is only necessary to
suppose that God, when he willed the end, willed the means necessary to
its accomplishment. If the Maker of all things intended that a certain
thing should come to pass, it is reasonable to suppose that provision
was made in the general arrangements of the universe for its coming to
pass consistently with these arrangements.

I thank you most sincerely for your Tract2 which I have read with very

not happened to see this tract. You had a strong case & you have stated
Edition: current; Page: [1081] it well & effectively, & above all, like
one who feels its importance. I cannot conceive how any other view than
that which you take, of the question raised by Mr Mansel,3 can be deemed
religious, or Christian; & I felt sure that in maintaining, from my own
point of view, the same conception of religious duty, I shd be in
complete sympathy with the best part of the religious world—using that
phrase in its literal & not in its slang acceptation. Accordingly the
manner in which so many of the greatest ornaments of the C[hurch] of
E[ngland] lately came forward4 to share the responsibility of a doctrine
which coming from me was called atheistic & satanic,5 did not cause me
half so much pleasure from its connexion with myself as because it so
fully justified the perfect confidence I had in their high feelings &
principles. It causes me no surprise but additional pleasure that you so

Allow me, in thanking you for your kind congratulations on the result of

electors of South Lancashire,2 on having placed themselves in the
honourable position Edition: current; Page: [1082] which another
constituency has so unwisely relinquished. Though your reelection for
the University under the new circumstances would have been, both
personally and publicly, a great triumph, the opposite result is not any
real loss, it being obvious to everybody that, but for the new mode of
voting, you would have been returned by a large majority. If the
temporary check to the Liberal party had indicated a retrograde movement
at Oxford, it would have been a serious matter. But the country knows
that the real University, the resident members of the body, are clear of
the discredit of this party move, and that, with them, you are stronger
than ever. It is even possible that this disappointment, by stimulating
the Liberal party in the University to increased exertions, may
ultimately be as great a help to the cause of improvement as even your
reelection would have been.

In revising my Logic for a new edition2 I have arrived at the places

the probability arising from the addition of two independent
improbabilities (Vol. 2. Ch. 23 § 6 of the third book). I find to my
very great regret that I have mislaid the paper which contained the
discussion of the point, and though I was convinced at the time, I have
not been able to reason out for myself the estimation of the compound
probability in the case supposed. Though I greatly regret giving you the
trouble, I should feel it a great favour if you would kindly put on
paper the few sentences which would be sufficient to make me once more
understand the matter as it really is.

I ought not to need this additional assistance but though it is my own

go without it.

Dear Sir—

It is precisely because I consider M. Comte to have been a great
thinker, that I regard it as a duty to balance the strong & deeply felt
admiration which I express for what I deem the fundamental parts of his
philosophy by an equally emphatic expression of the opposite feeling I
entertain towards other parts.2 It is M. Comte himself who, in my
judgment, has thrown ridicule on his own philosophy by the extravagances
of his later writings; & since he has done so, I conceive that the
mischief can only be corrected if those who desire to separate the first
from the last, shew that they are as much alive to the ridiculous side
of his character & speculations as those are who are unable to
appreciate his greatness. Unless this separation can be effected, either
the Edition: current; Page: [1086] absurdities will weigh down the
merits or the merits will float the absurdities, & since many of those
last are, in my estimation, of such a kind that if it were impossible to
laugh at them it would be necessary to denounce them seriously &
severely, I am glad that the former side of the alternative is possible.
Forgive the freedom with which I express what I know must appear to you
not only error & prejudice, but want of due modesty & reverence. But any
weaker terms would not put you in full possession of what I feel in the
matter, on which feeling must rest the justification of the tone of the
article. In saying that the offence I feared I might give would be
unintentional I did not mean that it would be unforeseen, but only that
such a consequence of my free speaking on the subject would be one which
I shd sincerely regret. I earnestly disclaimed, near the beginning of
the second article, any feeling but that of respect towards M. Comte’s
persistent disciples, and I am bound to acknowledge the extreme courtesy
of your letter, in circumstances which would have excused in my eyes
some vehemence of language.

TO AUGUSTUS DE MORGAN1

Aug. 9. 1865

Dear Sir

Your letter is clear and conclusive, and, together with my own letter
grounded on your previous one,2 makes the truth perfectly obvious in the
case to which they apply, viz. the comparative probabilities of the
different causes which may have produced a known effect. But it is not
quite so easy to apply the same principle to cases in which there is no
known effect to be accounted for, but the antecedent probability of an
unknown fact is to be estimated from mere statistics. Take the case in
its most general form, as it stands in my book: Two of every three As
are Bs, three of every four Cs are Bs, what is the probability that
something which is both an A and a C is a B?3

The beginning of the argument runs smoothly enough. If the thing is a B,
something must be true which is only true twice in every thrice, and
something else which is only true thrice in every four times, and this
coincidence will only happen six times in twelve. If the thing is not a
B, something must be true which is only true once in every thrice, and
something else which is only true once in every four times, and this
coincidence will only happen once in twelve times; making the
comparative probabilities six to one. But what becomes of the other five
cases in this statement? In the case of the two witnesses these five
cases are put out of count, being cases in which the two witnesses give
opposite testimonies, which in the case in question it is known they
have not done. But what is the equivalent of this exclusion in the more
general theorem? It seems to me that in this, the a posteriori falsity
is replaced by an a priori impossibility, since the remaining five
cases, implying that the thing is both B and not B, involve a
contradiction.

There is something, to my mind, a little louche about this reasoning,
which makes me wish for your sanction to it before I make use of it. Is
there not something absurd in a theory of 12 possible cases of which 5
turn out impossible? In the case of the witnesses, the five cases are
not impossible, but it is merely known that the particular instance is
not one of them. But in the general form of the theorem it would seem as
if there were twelve cases, in six of which one thing is true; in one,
another thing; and in the remaining five, nothing.

I thank you for your kind wishes about my health. No doubt I shall be
fully occupied with Parliament during the session, but I hope by keeping
out of Edition: current; Page: [1089] engagements, to be able to work at
other subjects in the vacation. My safeguard is that I have no taste for
what is called society; which is the grand consumer of time, energy, and
in my case, of animal spirits. As I do not mean to let myself be drawn
into that, I hope to have a fair average amount of leisure like other
people.

TO HERBERT SPENCER1

Aug. 12. 1865

Dear Sir

When I received your article in the Fortnightly Review,2 the reprint of
my book on Hamilton was too far advanced to admit of any correcting at
the proper place the misconception which you pointed out in p. 536 of
the Review. Edition: current; Page: [1090] I consequently added a note
at the end of the volume, of which, in case you have not seen it, I
enclose a transcript.

I do not find that the distinction between the two senses of the word
inconceivable,3 removes or diminishes the difference between us. I was
already aware that the inconceivability which you regard as an ultimate
test, is the impossibility of uniting two ideas in the same mental
representation. But, unless I have still further misunderstood you, you
regard this incapacity of the conceptive faculty merely as the strongest
proof that can be given of a necessity of belief. Your test of an
ultimate truth I still apprehend to be the invariability of the belief
of it, tested by an attempt to believe its negative.

I have, in my turn, to correct a partial misunderstanding of my own
meaning. I did not assert that a belief is proved not to be necessary by
the fact that some persons deny its necessity, but by the fact that some
persons do not hold the belief itself; which opinion seems as evident as
the other would be absurd.4

On the main question between us your chief point seems to be, that the
Idealist argument is reduced to nonsense if we accept the idealist
conclusions, since it cannot be expressed without assuming an objective
reality producing, & a subjective reality receiving, the impression.5
The experience to which our states of mind are referred, is, ex vi
termini, (you think) experience of something other than states of mind.
This would be true if all states of mind were referred to something
anterior; but the ultimate elements in the analysis I hold to be
themselves states of mind, viz—sensations, memories of sensations, and
expectations of sensation. I do not pretend to account for these, or to
recognize anything in them beyond themselves and the order of their
occurrence; but I do profess to analyze our other states of
consciousness into them. Now I maintain that these are the only
substratum I need postulate; and that when anything else seems to be
postulated, it is only because of the erroneous theory on which all our
language is constructed, and that if the concrete words used are
interpreted as meaning our expectations of sensations the nonsense and
unmeaningness which you speak of do not arise.

I quite agree with you, however, that our difference is “superficial
rather than substantial”,6 or at all events, need not and does not
affect our general mode of explaining mental phenomena. From the first I
have wished to keep the peace with those whose belief in a substratum is
simply the belief in an Unknowable. You have said what you deemed
necessary to set yourself right on the points which had been in
controversy between us. I am glad you have done so, and am now disposed
to let the matter rest. There will probably be other and more hostile
criticisms, by Mansel and others, and if I should think it desirable to
reply to them, I could on the same occasion make some remarks Edition:
current; Page: [1091] on yours, without the appearance of antagonism
which I am anxious to avoid.

result is the Edition: current; Page: [1092] inclosed cartes of which

Dear Sir

From what you say of the projected School2 I feel no doubt that it will
be a good thing, and deserving of support; but I do not see how, with my
opinions, I could publicly associate myself as a special supporter and
recommender, with any school in which theology is part of the course;
for assuredly I do not think that theology ought to be taught in any
school; and there are, even at present, schools (the Birkbeck schools)3
in which none is taught; though I am not aware of any schools of that
sort for the higher and middle classes, unless it be the London
University College School,4 which, I believe is only a day school. It
might be useless, in the present state of the public mind to propose
such schools, and it may be quite right to support others; but I do not
feel that that justifies me in holding myself forth as approving, and
partly founding, schools in which a principle I wholly condemn is even
partly recognised and acted on. I must wait, therefore, to know more of
the actual plan of the institution in this respect, before I can judge
how far and in what way I can join in promoting its establishment.

Edition: current; Page: [1093]
When I said that our educational system needs other modifications still
more than it needs the due introduction of modern languages and physical
science,5 what I had chiefly in view was improvements in the mode of
teaching. It is disgraceful to human nature and society that the whole
of boyhood should be spent in pretending to learn certain things without
learning them. With proper methods and good teachers boys might really
learn Greek and Latin, instead of making believe to learn them, and
might have ample time besides for science and for as much of modern
languages as there is any use in teaching to them while at school. And
if science were taught as badly as Greek and Latin are taught, it would
not do their minds more good.

Dear Sir—

Having a strong impression that I shd like the book which you did me the
favour to send,2 I delayed writing to thank you for it until I shd have
had time to read it through.

I have now done so & I not only agree with far the greater part of the
opinions expressed but consider the book as of permanent value & shall
keep it by me for reference, especially on points connected with our
military & naval system, & with law reform.

The chief points on which I differ from you are

1st. I think you ascribe too great influence to differences of race &
too little to historical differences & to accidents as causes of the
diversities of character & usage existing among mankind.3

2dly. I cannot join with you (glad as I shd be to do so) in thinking
that the wages-receiving class, if universally enfranchised would have
no class feelings or class opinions as such.4 The fact that the
operative classes are divided Edition: current; Page: [1094] on many
questions of politics & legislation is equally true of the higher, or
the middle class, of landholders, or of capitalists, & is as consistent
in the one case as in the other with their holding together as a compact
body in cases in which their joint interest is or seems to be involved,
or in which any bias arising from their common social position is liable
to operate.

I am heartily glad to welcome you as an adherent of a reading & writing
qualification. We agree in thinking that this, combined with
independence of public charity, should entitle to a vote. I do not find
any notice in your book of the principle of representation of minorities
or rather, representation of all instead of a number of local
majorities. I cannot help wishing that your attention were drawn to a
principle which besides its inherent justice and manifold expediency,
would be the most important corrective, as I think, of the
inconveniences liable to arise from universal suffrage even subject to
the condition of reading and writing.

Aug. 22. 1865

Dear Sir

I have read your letter in the Economist.2 It is extremely well done,
and I sympathize fully in your feelings, but it does not touch any of my
difficulties.

I still think that the proper ground to take is to insist on keeping out
of the Senate of the Queen’s University3 any person who is disaffected
to the purpose for which that University was instituted, viz. mixed
education.4 The Catholic party have a just claim to be represented in
the choice of examiners, but none whatever to have a voice in the
curriculum of study for any but their own institutions, or the
conditions of a degree even for those. These are things to be decided
only by the State. If necessary, the subjects of examination ought to be
fixed, not by the body which confers degrees, but by the government, or
even by act of parliament.

You are quite right to point out the bad consequences which are likely
to Edition: current; Page: [1095] follow the present concession,5 even
if it cannot be with propriety refused. But the great point is, to
insist that the particular scheme of education which the British nation
has instituted because it thinks that (for Ireland) it is the best,
shall continue to have fair play; and that the enemies of the scheme
shall have no voice in deciding how it shall be carried out. This is
also the utmost which there is any chance of obtaining; for the ministry
cannot retract after the general election what they promised before it.
They must either keep their promise, or resign.

I am Dear Sir
 yours very truly

TO GEORGE GROTE1

Aug. 22. 1865

My dear Grote

I am sorry to say that this present day is the first time since I left
Avignon on which I have been able to resume Plato. The whole time here,
since I got clear of the election, has been occupied in preparing a new
edition of the Logic;2 which I had hoped to be spared until December and
January, when the article for the Edinburgh3 would be finished. But
Longman came down on me unexpectedly with a peremptory demand; which I
should not be much surprised, after all, to find had been premature.
From this pressure, I have been obliged to get through the revision of
the Logic in a more summary manner than I had hoped to do, and to
content myself with alterations and additions to several chapters which
I had once thought of rewriting altogether. I have limited myself to
what was indispensable, but have given references to the book on
Hamilton on points into which I could not enter at length. I read
Professor Grote’s4 book carefully, but found speculations and criticisms
much more vague and less tangible than I expected. Bain seemed to think
that Edition: current; Page: [1096] the objection to Noumena was
important, and merited notice, but, as I understand it, it amounts to
little. It is very well to say, why suppose an unknowable entity as the
substratum of everything knowable, but the truth seems to be that the
Professor merely, with Reid and Hamilton, believes this unknowable
entity to be the knowable. Altogether I could make no use of the
Exploratio for the improvement of my Logic, and have merely touched upon
it briefly in a note.5

I have also (but this was a very slight business) revised the two
articles on Comte for republication by Trübner as a small volume. I need
hardly say how glad I am that you like them. The parallel which struck
you between Comte in his old age and Plato in his, had impressed itself
forcibly on my own mind.

I was very happy to infer from Mrs Grote’s letter to Helen, that the
visit to Baden was benefitting her health. It is hardly to be expected
that her recovery should be rapid from the state of prostration she
seems to have been in. All will depend upon her being surrounded for a
considerable time with the most favourable circumstances attainable. We
are not likely either to see you and her before our departure or to
encounter you on the Continent, as we go first to North Germany, and
shall make a long though very rapid circuit before settling down to
Avignon and Plato. There is now no other heavy work hanging over me
before the meeting of Parliament, and the worst that can happen is that
I may have to ask Reeve6 for an additional three months, so as to have
the whole time up to February available.

Your doubts whether the new employment of so much of my time will on the
whole be a good thing, answer to corresponding misgivings of my own. It
will depend on what I find myself able to do in Parliament in the way of
promulgating useful opinions and adding to improving influences. How
much this will be, neither I nor anyone else can know beforehand, but it
will be a positive duty for me to try my utmost. On the other point you
speak of, the new influences brought to bear on the tone of my writings,
I feel quite easy. Those new influences will have no effect at all. I
consented to be elected on the footing of not modifying or keeping back
a high opinion on account of its being unacceptable to the public or the
electors. As much to my own astonishment as to that of others, I
actually was elected on that footing, and nothing else that I said or
did, had so much success at all the public meetings as that had. As for
the social influences which so often corrupt or tame men when they go
into Parliament, I shall protect myself against those by keeping out of
their way.

An intelligent correspondent of mine in Greece, Mr Leonidas Sgouta,7 has
Edition: current; Page: [1097] sent me the inclosed appeal from the
Archaeological Society of Athens to those in the Western countries who
are interested in Grecian antiquities. You are at the central point of
all such, and I cannot better promote the object than by sending the
papers to you. I should be very glad to join with others in any
subscription for the object.

Ever my dear Grote

.

Dear Sir

I am sincerely obliged to you for giving me an opportunity of reading
the letter of General Cox,2 and your excellent paper in reply.3

You ask me for an opinion. I should hesitate very long before obtruding
upon any American, and still more upon the American public, any mere
opinion of mine respecting their internal concerns. But it is the
concern of all mankind, almost as much as of the United States, that the
conquests achieved by your great and arduous struggle should not be, in
the very hour of victory, carelessly flung away: and the opinion which
you do me the honor to ask is one which I share with so many of the
noblest and wisest Americans, that I need have the less scruple in
expressing it.

It is certainly some gain to the negroes, and to the principle of
freedom, that they have been made even nominally free. I do not pretend
that it is nothing, that they can no longer legally be bought and sold.
But this is about the amount of all they will have gained, if the power
of legislation over them is handed over once more to their old masters,
and to the mean whites by whom they are despised as much, and probably
hated more, than even by their masters, and who have been fighting these
four years to retain them enslaved. If it were not for your State
institutions, the case would not be so pressing, for those who have made
them free could keep them so. But, once the war power laid down, and the
regular course of State government restored, what is to prevent a State
legislature chosen by their enemies from making laws under which, unless
they resist by force, they will have as little the control of their own
actions, as little protection for life, honor, and property, will
Edition: current; Page: [1099] in short be, except in a few of the
outward incidents of slavery, almost as much slaves as before? To bring
this about, it would not even be necessary to enact new laws. It would
suffice to leave the old ones unrepealed, by which the testimony of a
negro cannot be received against a white. Nay, even were these laws
abrogated, nothing more would be needed than partiality and prejudice in
the white courts of justice. And would it be consistent with ordinary
human nature that such partiality and prejudice should not exist? All
this is so evident that even the candidate to whose letter you so ably
replied, is quite aware of it; and can suggest no means of averting the
evil, except what I agree with you in regarding as the chimerical
project, of effecting a local separation between the two races,
excluding the negroes from the jurisdiction of the States, and giving
them a territorial government apart. It is not to be believed that the
President or Congress will entertain such a scheme as this seriously.
If, then, they allow the Southern States to reorganize themselves and
resume all their constitutional rights without negro suffrage, what is
to be done? To abandon the negroes to the tender mercies of those from
whom, at so terrible a cost, you have so lately rescued them? No party
or set of men in the Free States are so shameless as to propose this
combined turpitude and imbecility. But the freedom of the negroes and
the self-government of the Southern States as at present constituted,
cannot coexist: and if it is determined that, come what will, the former
shall be a reality, it must be intended that the latter should be a mere
pretence. A censorship will have to be exercised over all the acts, both
legislative and administrative, of the State governments; the Federal
authorities will by military coercion prevent or set aside all
proceedings calculated to interfere with that equality of civil rights
which they are bound by every consideration both of duty and of interest
to secure to the freed race. And this military dictatorship will have to
be continued for a very great length of time; for it is speaking within
bounds to say that two generations must elapse before the habits and
feelings engendered by slavery give place to new ones; before the stain
which the position of slave master burns into the very souls of the
privileged population can be expected to fade out.

This is the state of things which the policy now apparently acted on by
the Federal Government leads to; but I have too high an opinion of the
intentions and feelings of the President, and the practical good sense
and determination of the American people, to believe that such a policy
will be persevered in. It would be nothing less than electing to rule
tyrannically over the whole Southern population, in order to avoid
depriving the white half of that population of the power of tyrannizing
over the black half.

Instead of restoring to the States lately in rebellion a nominal
self-government which, unless you are willing to sacrifice all that has
been gained by four years of civil war, can not be suffered to be real,
would it not be better Edition: current; Page: [1100] to make the
self-government real, but to grant it only to a mixed community, in
which the population who have been corrupted by vicious institutions
will be neutralized by black citizens and white immigrants from the
North?

And what is the hindrance to this in the minds of the President and his
cabinet? Is it scruples about legality? To be scrupulous about exceeding
his lawful powers, well becomes the first magistrate of a free people.
But in this case the scruple seems wholly out of place. We are told that
the rebel States must be assumed never to have been out of the Union,
and therefore to be unconditionally entitled to all their original
liberties and powers the moment they condescend to accept them. Reason
would say, on the contrary, that by declaring themselves independent of
the Union, they could not indeed, divest themselves of its obligations,
but certainly forfeited its privileges. A state of civil war suspends
all legal rights, and all social compacts, between the combatants.
Except under the terms of a capitulation, defeated rebels have no rights
but the universal ones of humanity. The Southern people, their lives,
bodies, and estates, were by the issue of the war, placed at the
discretion of their conquerors; but of conquerors whom both the general
law of right, and the special principles of their own social and
political institutions, forbid to exercise permanent dominion over any
human beings as subjects, or on any other footing than that of equal
citizenship. It would, however, be on the part of the Free States a
generosity partaking of silliness, were they to give back to their
bitter enemies not only power to govern themselves, and the negroes
within their limits, but (through representatives in Congress,) to
govern the Free States too, without first exacting such changes in the
structure of Southern society as will render such a relation between
them and the Free States rational and safe. If you have not a right to
do this, you had not a right to impose the abolition of Slavery.
Consider what an element you are going once more to admit into the
supreme government of the Union. Think of this one thing—it is but one
of many. Every Southern member of Congress, elected without negro
suffrage, is a sure vote for that blackest and most disgraceful breach
of faith, which would brand American democracy and popular government
itself with a mark that would endure for generations—the repudiation of
the war debt. The Southern representatives, in fact, would be the only
members of Congress who could honestly vote for this; since to their
minds, unless the Confederate debt is recognised too, it would seem only
equal justice. This is of itself a sufficient reason why no community,
composed exclusively or principally of those who have been engaged in
the rebellion, is fit to have a voice in Congress. Of course the States
have to be readmitted: to keep them out, and govern them as subjects,
would be in contradiction to all the principles of the American or any
other free constitution. But the future history of America perhaps for
ages to come, depends (I cannot but think) upon your requiring them,
before admission, to give Edition: current; Page: [1101] guarantees to
freedom, by admixture with fellow citizens whose interests and feelings
are in unison with justice and with the principles of the Free States.
Migration from the North will do this in time and in part, but only
negro suffrage can do it sufficiently.

I have no objection to requiring, as a condition of the suffrage,
education up to the point of reading and writing; but on condition that
this shall be required equally from the whites. The poor whites of the
South are understood to need education quite as much as the negroes, and
are certainly quite as unfit for the exercise of the suffrage without
it.

Dear Sir

The “middle course” which you seem to think not feasible2 would, I
think, consist in making the Board which confers degrees totally
distinct from any of the Colleges, and depriving it of all authority
over them. Perhaps the best mode would be to place the whole affair
under the University of London,3 appointing, as you suggest a few
persons in the confidence of the Ultramontanes4 to seats in the Senate.
If this is objected to, it seems to me that a similar body, named by the
Government, and in which the Ultramontanes should be represented but not
to the extent of half, should be created for Ireland. They are not
entitled to half. The Catholic religion is entitled to half, but not any
particular section of the Catholic body. The Government would merely in
appointing Catholics take care to appoint some of the Ultramontane
party, instead of taking care to exclude that party.

But I am afraid there is little chance of getting this, or anything like
it, Edition: current; Page: [1102] assented to by the Government or
Parliament. Jacta est alea5 I fear. But there must be a stir made in the

Dear Sir

I thank you sincerely for your letter and its enclosures.2 Your details
are of importance by shewing that a strike, when extending to an entire
trade, or even to a great part of it throughout the country, is
sometimes remarkably successful. But you seem to argue that the benefit
to the operators is not at the expense of the employers, being, I
suppose, reimbursed to them by the increased price of the article in
which they deal, being, in the present case, houses. Now this might, and
often would, happen in a single trade, but you have not, perhaps,
considered that it could not happen if the rise of wages extended to
all, or the generality, of trades. I could shew that there could not
possibly be, in that case, an equivalent rise of general prices. But I
content myself with saying that even if there was, it would not
compensate the employers, since a rise of price extending to all things
is merely nominal. Besides, a rise of wages accompanied by an equivalent
rise of all prices would be no benefit to the labouring classes.

I think you will find, on consideration, that though a partial rise of
wages may be at the expense of the consumer, a general one is always at
that of the employer; which however is far from being, with me, a reason
for not desiring it. I am Dear Sir

Yours very sincerely

TO JOHN BOYD KINNEAR1

Munich

Sept. 25. 1865

Dear Sir—

Many thanks for your long & interesting letter. It is well that those
who agree as much as we do shd occasionally discuss their points of
difference, if only for the sake of suggesting to each other matter for
further thought. I will therefore add a few words by way of rejoinder
confining myself at present to your third point, the extension of the
suffrage.2

My experience agrees with yours as to the greater mental honesty, &
amenability to reason, of the better part of the working classes,
compared with the average of either the higher or middle. But may not
this reasonably be ascribed to the fact that they have not yet, like the
others, been corrupted by power? The English working classes have had no
encouragement to think themselves better than, or as good as, those who
are more educated than themselves. But once let them become the
ascendant power & a class of base adventurers in the character of
professional politicians will be constantly addressing them with all
possible instigations to think their own crude notions better than the
theories & refinements of thinking people, & I do not deem so highly of
any numerous portion of the human race as to believe that it is not
corruptible by the flattery which is always addressed to power.

The vertical divisions of opinion which you speak of seem to me to
belong to the past, & to be almost wholly the effect of bad laws, now
mostly removed. Who ever thinks of opposition of interest or feeling
between the agricultural & the trading classes now that the corn laws
have been repealed?3 But the division between labourers & employers of
labour seems to me to be increasing in importance, & gradually
swallowing up all others, & I believe it will be always widening &
deepening unless, or until, the growth of Cooperation practically merges
both classes into one. And if either of the two powers is strong enough
to prevail without the help of an enlightened minority of the opposite
class, it seems to me contrary to all experience of human nature to
suppose that it will not abuse its power. There is no considerable
opposition of apparent interest among the different kinds of manual
labourers. Even if there be any kind of them whose wages do not admit of
being raised, which I for one do not believe (much less would they),
they would still, I apprehend, vote for a law which they thought would
raise the wages of others, since the rise would not be at their expense.
Neither is it only on the question of wages, or hours of labour, that
the poorest & most Edition: current; Page: [1104] numerous class would
feel a common interest as against the propertied classes; might they not
be tempted to throw all taxes on property—or even on realised property—&
to make the taxes heavy in order, by their outlay, to benefit as they
might think, trade & labour? Does anyone think them sufficiently
enlightened to have outgrown these fallacies? I am expressing all this
very crudely for want of time & space, but “I speak as to wise men—judge
ye what I speak.”4

I heartily wish you were in the H. of C. to speak there the whole of
your book5 & many things besides. But perhaps the wish will appear to
you like that of the fox who had lost his tail.

There has lately been forwarded to me from Blackheath a note from Mr
Walford,2 one of the editors of “Once a Week”, saying that he had been
asked to suggest a proper person to go out to India to edit a daily
paper, with a good salary guaranteed for three years certain, a
knowledge of commercial politics being one of the requisites. He wished
to know whether I thought you qualified for such a post, as if so he
should like to recommend you for it. I was in some difficulty in giving
a distinct answer to Mr Walford’s question, from not knowing exactly
what he meant by commercial politics, nor knowing completely what
commercial questions you had attended to. I stated to him this
difficulty, but said that I thought you quite competent to the editing
and much of the writing of such a paper as he mentioned. I did not,
however, say anything leading him to suppose either that you would, or
that you would not, be likely to accept such a position, not knowing
whether it would be more agreeable to you than your present one. I have
heard nothing further from Mr Walford, but I think it as well to mention
to you what has passed on the subject. It is at any rate an additional
instance of a favourable impression made by you.

TO MONCURE DANIEL CONWAY1

Oct. 23. 1865

Dear Sir

I cannot thank you enough for Mr Wendell Phillips’ admirable speeches.2
I was not aware that he was so thorough an adherent of not only
representation of minorities, but what is much more, personal
representation—the Edition: current; Page: [1106] representation of
every elector: that great idea of which the credit, though Mr Phillips
seems to give it to me, is exclusively due to Mr Hare. It is hardly
possible to state the merits of the principle more forcibly, or with a
more thorough understanding of all its importance, than Mr Phillips has
done. It is indeed at once a direct corollary from the first principles
of democracy, and a most powerful corrective of all evils liable to
arise from the forms of democratic government hitherto in use. That Mr
Phillips should have taken it up, and in the manner he has, is most
cheering and auspicious. I was not aware of the publication he mentions,
and should like very much to see it.

I beg that you will express my warmest thanks to Mr Phillips for his
correction of my unintentional misrepresentation of the Abolitionists—to
whom, I hope I need not say that I meant no disparagement, having always
regarded them as the élite of their country, not to say of their age. I
have been much gratified by receiving so strong a confirmation, from
such authority, of my opinion concerning Tocqueville, which I shall now
hold with increased confidence.

I have not, however, been convinced by Mr Phillips’ argument against an
educational qualification.3 It is very true that intelligence, and even
a high order of it, may be formed by other means than reading, and even
(though, I think, rarely) without the aid of reading: but not, I think,
intelligence of public affairs, or the power of judging of public men,
save perhaps in exceptional cases, too few to affect the practical
conclusion. At the present crisis, however, the securing of equal
political rights to the negro is paramount to all other considerations
respecting the suffrage. I should be glad to think that you are strong
enough to reject a compromise admitting negroes on an educational
qualification common to them with the whites. As things look now, it
seems as if even that would be a thing to be thankful for.

The author of the article “Enfranchisement of Women” would have been
Edition: current; Page: [1107] well rewarded by the progress which that
question is making, had she lived to see it.4 Nothing would have
gratified her more than to hear on such high authority that a cause to

Dear Sir

I have to thank you for three letters2 which have been reproaching me
ever since they were forwarded from Blackheath. The one on probability I
was obliged to lay by for reperusal. This I have now been able to give
to it and I seem to myself to follow the reasoning and agree with it.
You have probably observed the correction I made on the point in
question in the new edition of my Logic.3 It will probably now require a
supplementary one. If the edition were still unpublished I would have
asked you for a short note with leave to insert it as yours.

I agree with you about the misuse of prepositions, but is “averse to” a
case of it? Undoubtedly we ought to have said averse from; but did
writers in any [era?] of English literature, say so?

When I refer to a former “book,” I always mean liber not opus. The
confusion is only pardonable in conversation where the context usually
clears it up.

Edition: current; Page: [1108]
I have sometimes thought I ought to have some mark for alterations and
additions. But one could scarcely give distinctive marks to all the
successive strata of new matter, and a mere note of distinction from the
edition immediately previous would not answer the [purposes of] those
readers who only possess a still earlier one.

I well remember our meeting long ago, on the occasion you refer to, and
I have retained ever since a vivid impression of your personal
appearance. By the way, the phrenological indications in your letter do
not by any means tally with what knowledge I possess of my own
character; but I refrain from saying in what they differ from it, as I
am not [—?] to shew up my weak points.

Dear Sir—

Your letter dated Sept. 29 has been forwarded to me here. For the good
opinion & good will which it expresses as regards myself I am duly
thankful.2 You will scarcely be surprised that the bitter hostility it
declares against my country & (with a few individual exceptions) against
the whole of my countrymen, produces in me a very different sentiment.

No one disapproves more, or is in the habit of expressing his
disapprobation more strongly than I do of the narrow, exclusive
patriotism of former ages which made the good of the whole human race a
subordinate consideration to the good, or worse still, to the mere power
& external importance, of the country of one’s birth. I believe that the
good of no country can be obtained by any means but such as tend to that
of all countries, nor ought to be Edition: current; Page: [1109] sought
otherwise, even if obtainable. If my country were peopled, as you seem
to think, by the scum of the earth, & if its existence were a standing
nuisance to all other nations, I for one would shake the dust from my
feet & seek a better country elsewhere. But, speaking as one who has
never kept any terms with national vanity nor ever hesitated to tell his
countrymen of their faults & who has especially censured the feelings &
conduct of an influential portion of them on the occasion of your late
glorious contest, I do not admit the charges brought against them in
your letter. England is to the populations of Europe the representative,
by no means perfect but still the representative, of the same principles
of social & political freedom which Americans so justly cherish. Any
weakening of her influence would be simply so much additional
discouragement to popular institutions & to liberty of thought, speech,
& action throughout the old continents, & strengthening of the hands of
despotism, temporal & spiritual, all over the world.

A war between Great Britain & the United States, were such a calamity
possible, would give a new lease to tyranny & bigotry wherever they
exist, & would throw back the progress of mankind for generations. Let
me remind you that what you say about the grasping disposition &
aggressive spirit of the English Government & people, is exactly &
literally what the ignorant and prejudiced part of the higher & middle
classes of Great Britain sincerely think & say concerning America. In
neither of the two cases is the accusation true: but the profound
ignorance of each other which it exhibits in both countries, is a most
serious danger & evil to the world, which all who wish well to mankind
must earnestly desire to cure, & which can only be exagerated by the
indulgence of such feelings as you express.

TO HERBERT SPENCER1

Saint Véran, Avignon

Oct. 29, 1865

Dear Sir:—

I have kept your letter by me unanswered, partly for want of time, and
partly in hopes that the delay might enable something to occur to me
which would throw light on the rather subtle matter of difference
between us which you bring to my notice.2 It is evident that I have
again a misapprehension of your opinion to confess and correct, since
you do not acknowledge it as yours in the mode in which it is stated by
me. We seem to differ on two questions, one a question of fact, viz.
whether it is possible, while looking at the sun, to imagine darkness.
You, and your three friends, think it is not, while my consciousness
seems to tell me that it is quite as possible to imagine darkness in its
absence, as anything else in its absence. Of course the stronger present
Edition: current; Page: [1111] impression of an actual sensation makes
the simultaneous consciousness of a mere recollection seem feeble by
comparison. But it appears to me perfectly real, and as like the
impression of sense which it corresponds to, as most reminiscences are
to their originals.

But, you say, even if I could, under such conditions, imagine darkness,
it would not follow that I could imagine that I am actually at the
moment looking into darkness. To me it seems, that to imagine an object
of sight, is always to imagine myself actually at the moment seeing it.
I think one never imagines anything otherwise than as an immediate and
present impression of one’s own. Indeed, when the object to be conceived
is darkness, there is absolutely nothing else to imagine, than oneself
trying to see and not seeing; for darkness is not a positive thing. It
seems to me, then, that I can, in broad daylight, conceive myself then &
there looking into darkness. Is this the same thing, or not the same
thing, as what you mean by the words “conceive that I am then and there
looking into darkness”?3 It strikes me that this change of the
expression to the form I am, just marks the transition from conception
to belief—from an imagination of something thought as absent from the
senses, to an apprehension of something which is thought to be present
to the senses; of which two states of mind I hold the former to be, in
the assumed circumstances, possible, the latter impossible. It was in
this way I was led to think that you were here using the word conception
in the sense of belief. Even now, I cannot see how the phrase, to
conceive that I am, or that anything is, can be consistent with using
the word conceive in its rigorous sense.

I am, Dear Sir,
 Yours very sincerely,

Though I should like very much to be of service to Count Gurowski, and
really think his book2 well worthy of republication, I should not be
willing to write an introduction to it, or attach my name to it as
Editor. I have abstained hitherto, and prefer still to abstain, from
making myself responsible for other people’s writings; and in this book
there are so many severe things said of individual politicians, that it
would be wrong in me, with no more information than I possess, to make
myself a party to them, and hardly possible to put my name to the book
without seeming to do so.

Your report respecting the work on Comte is very satisfactory.3 A
translation of it into French is in course of being made, with my
concurrence, to be published by Germer Baillière.4 With regard to a
German translation,5 I have no wish except that it should not be done by
an incompetent person. I do not look for any gain from it, and I doubt
if it would be worth the while of a publisher to give anything worth
taking for the privilege: but if it should so happen, I propose that we
should divide equally whatever is obtained.

I do not wish any copies to be sent here; but I should like a copy sent

list I sent you; also to J. S. Storr Esq.6 26 King Street Covent Garden,

TO GEORGE GROTE1

Saint Véran, Avignon

Nov. 10. 1865

My dear Grote

I find myself, from my want of knowledge of the Platonic critics,
ignorant of the merits of a question of some importance and difficulty,
viz. whether the Platonic Apologia is in substance the real defence of
Sokrates. I learn from your book that Schleiermacher and Ueberweg think
so,2 and that you are of the same opinion. But on the other hand, the
Platonic Apologia is almost wholly different from the Xenophontic,3
which latter professes to be the defence actually made by Sokrates and
told to Xenophon by Hermogenes, who is also mentioned in the Phaedon as
one of the friends who were with Sokrates at his death.4 Xenophon says,5
indeed, that many more things were said by Sokrates than are included in
his report; and the things which Xenophon was likely to omit, would be
just those which Plato would relate. But Plato’s report does not profess
to omit anything. If both are genuine, we must suppose that each
reporter left out exactly what the other took, for there is hardly
anything in common to them both, except the allusion to Palamedes.6 Now,
in every other case, you seem to regard the Xenophontic, and not the
Platonic, as the historical Sokrates. Could you, without much trouble,
give me some notion of the reasons for holding the opposite opinion in
this particular case?

If the Apologia is not the real speech of Sokrates I do not know why we
should consider it as authoritative evidence of the point of view of
Sokrates as distinct from Plato. For it seems almost equally unlikely
that Plato would have put anything unSokratic into the mouth of Sokrates
in the affecting narrative of the last day of his life: yet he does,
without scruple, put into his mouth on that day the whole of his own two
doctrines of Ideas and Reminiscence, which, as far as I know, neither
you nor any one supposes to have been held by Sokrates. These things are
a real puzzle to me: an ἀπορια for which I greatly need τον
καταλυσοντα.7

Reeve has very courteously consented to wait for the article till the
April number,8 which gives me the whole time up to the meeting of
Parliament for Edition: current; Page: [1116] completing it. I have not
yet written anything, but have read Plato all through, and am now going
through your book carefully again, not only referring to Plato
frequently, but reading once more quite through some of the most
important of the dialogues which I read last spring: Phaedon,
Parmenides, Theoctetus, Sophistes, Politikos, &c.

The article in the Westminster on your book9 seems to me very good. I am
curious to know who wrote it.

If you have time to answer this, please tell us also how Mrs Grote is,
for it is long since we heard.

Ever yours affectionately

Sir—

To give a proper answer to your question2 would be to write the essay
which you are intending to write. But if you wish for a mere opinion,
expressed in few words, I would say,

1. Severe punishments of some kind are often necessary for boys, but
only when they have been negligently or ill brought up & allowed to
acquire bad habits.

2. Assuming severe punishments to be necessary, any other mode of
punishment that would be effectual is preferable to flogging. In the
case however of certain grave moral delinquencies chiefly those which
are either of a cowardly or of a brutal character, corporal punishment
in that or some equivalent form may be admissible.

Nov. 15. 1865

Dear Sir

I have been a long time without acknowledging your very interesting
letter of July 1. My excuse must be the great quantity of temporary
business (including a vast amount of letter-writing) which has come upon
me lately, and the necessity of finishing off old engagements before the
new and engrossing ones commence.

I hope you at length received the book on Hamilton. I gave a fresh order
for sending it to you, having reason to think that the first had not
been executed. You will have found less than you probably expected on
the Freewill controversy, the object having been, not to give a complete
view of the metaphysics of the question, but merely to reply to some
objections and resolve certain difficulties. I am glad you were
interested by the review of Comte. The remarks on his philosophy in your
letter are just and reasonable from your own point of view. Above all,
they are clear; a merit which your writings possess in a degree not
common with the a priori or spiritualist metaphysicians.

I was happy to find, though it was no more than I expected, that we
think exactly alike on the necessity of giving equality of political
rights to the negroes. What has just taken place in Jamaica2 might be
used as a very strong argument against leaving the freedmen to be
legislated for by their former masters. The legislation appears to have
been just such as might have been expected, and the consequence is what
we see. It seems not at all unlikely that England will have to make a
clean sweep of the institutions of Jamaica, and suspend the power of
local legislation altogether, until the necessary internal reforms have
been effected by the authority of the mother country. How much more
needful, then, is it that America should refrain from giving back to the
rebel states the rights already forfeited by them, except on such
conditions as will secure equal laws and an impartial administration
Edition: current; Page: [1118] of justice between colour and colour;
which will not and cannot be the case unless the Negroes can serve on
juries, and, through the electoral suffrage, have an equal voice in
choosing or controlling the judges, or those who appoint them. I felt
greatly discouraged a short time ago by the turn which events seemed to
be taking; but the published conversation between the President and Mr
Stearns3 has revived my hopes; for it seems to shew that Mr Johnson does
not differ fundamentally from us; that he only hesitates on the question
of time, and is ready even at once to enfranchise the negroes subject to
certain conditions, which he would make applicable also to the
uneducated whites. If he adheres to this, and also to his declared
opinion that non-electors ought not to be counted, even in a fractional
proportion, as part of the population that determines the number of
Federal representatives; the Republican majority in Congress will be
able to act with him, and to prevent any serious mischief.

You must be greatly edified, if you read the English newspapers and
periodicals, by their change of tone on American affairs. Those who, at
the time of the colonization of New England, used to be called “waiters
on Providence,” have changed sides, and are now profuse of panegyrics on
the people of the United States. Their praise is of no more intrinsic
value than their attacks were before; but it is an additional proof what
a great benefit your people have conferred on mankind by shewing what
democracy and universal education together can do—how they make a whole
people heroes when heroism is required, and peaceful citizens again as
soon as the necessity is ended. Most English observers are also much
struck by the total absence of vindictive spirit, even under the
provocation of Mr Lincoln’s murder. I do not share their surprise, my
only fear having been that your people would forgive too easily. But if
they only take care not to be forgiving at the Negroes’ expense, I am
ready to join in the universal chorus.

We often think and talk of you, both at Blackheath and here, where we
first saw you. I hope to hear from you now and then. It is of no
consequence whether you direct here or to Blackheath, as letters are
promptly forwarded.

Dear Sir

I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 30th ulto. It is
needless to send me the North American Review, as I am already a
subscriber to it; but I am always glad to hear from any of the writers
and to be enabled to identify an article with its author. The essay on
American Political Ideas2 I had read the day before I received your
letter. There is a good cause why the Americans are more attached than
the people of other countries to the principles of their Constitution;
it is because their Constitution has principles. The British
Constitution has no principles: it is the unpremeditated and unplanned
result of a secular conflict of opposing forces. There are however,
principles, not laid down in words, but involved both in the English and
in the American institutions, viz. personal freedom; liberty of thought
and publication; and, in America, perfect civil equality between one
person and another. To these principles the people of each country are
strongly attached, but in neither are they thoroughly carried out,
though by you far more nearly so than by us. I hope you are going to
carry the last of them into effect as between white people and black;
after which it will still remain to bring it into operation between men
and women.

I have great pleasure in subscribing to every word of the practical
exhortations in your concluding paragraphs. Society in the Southern
States has to be democratized in law and in fact, on the principles of
the Declaration of Independence, otherwise the sufferings and sacrifices
of these glorious years will be more than half lost. And this will be
easily done if the people of the Northern States do but will it. The
opinions, feelings, and entire civilization of the North have made a
wonderful stride since the war began. If they are not yet quite up to
the final mark, who can blame them? May they reach it before anything
irrevocable has been done in restoring the rebel States to their
constitutional rights. I am Dear Sir

TO GEORGE GROTE1

Saint Véran, Avignon

Nov. 26. 1865

My dear Grote

I am very much indebted to you for taking the trouble to give me such
full explanations in answer to my question respecting the Apologia.2 The
points you mention in Xenophon and Plato are all familiar to me, but I
wanted your appreciation of them, and that you have given me. I had been
much struck with the fact that the two authorities are not agreed even
as to what the oracle was, though unquestionably they must both have
known it. There is also a prima facie objection to the statement of
Sokrates in the Apology, that he first commenced his cross-examining
Elenchus after he had already been declared by the oracle to be the
wisest of men. If the oracle declared this of Sokrates before he set out
on the career which has given him all his fame with posterity, the
oracle must have had remarkable sagacity and wonderfully good
information. However this may be, I understand you to think that
Sokrates spoke the substance of what Xenophon ascribes to him, and also
matters which, idealized by Plato, became the Platonic Apology;3 and
this seems much the most probable supposition which can be made.

I now feel assured how far I can safely build upon the character of
Sokrates which the Apology indicates; and that is what I wanted. I do
not think it possible, without abridging more important matter, to
discuss in the article Plato’s precise relation to Sokrates. His
relation to the Sokratic dialectic is the important thing: and, by the
aid of your book and of the familiarity I have now acquired with Plato
himself, this is not difficult to bring out.

I have written a great part of the article, and see my way clearly to
the end of it. There will never, I think, have been as much said about
Plato in the same space; but there will not be anything both important
and new in it, for you have left nothing to do: except that every fresh
turning over of the ground makes some of the things that are turned up
look new by some new light which falls on them.

We are very happy to hear your favourable account of Mrs. Grote. Pray
give her our kindest regards. I am equally pleased and honoured by your
reviewing me for Chapman,4 and I am glad that you take the opportunity
of Edition: current; Page: [1121] doing justice to my father.5 My own
contribution to his memory is already written in a MS designed for
posthumous publication;6 though if I live more than a few years longer,
I shall very likely publish it while I am alive.

I am fully and greatly enjoying my last weeks of freedom. The chief
occupation of this year has been with Plato, Sokrates, and you: and
there could not have been, to me, a pleasanter one.

not. I however expect a parcel from Blackheath in a week or thereabouts,

writing solely to forward applications which you are quite right in
thinking I should be unable to comply with. I am not surprised at your
not accepting the offer of the Indian Editorship,3 and were I in your
place I would not accept it either. Your present position, like all
others, may have its disagreeables, but they are probably much less than

the remarks mentioned in your letter as made by the Moderate Liberals
must come from very moderate Liberals indeed. If (which I am not aware
of) the Liberal party is “rapidly approaching a state of complete
disorganisation”, the conclusion I should draw would be that it is time
for it to dissolve, and organise itself anew on some better basis. I am
sure no party can deserve to be kept together which is in danger of
being broken up by the accession of two or three persons who are thought
likely to speak opinions freely which are in advance of the rest. But
the Moderate Liberals are always anxious to stop the mouths of the
immoderate ones, and these things are said and printed for the effect it
is hoped they may produce on the supposed marplots themselves. I am Dear

I have this morning had the honour of receiving your letter of the 23rd

At almost any other time than the present I should have felt it a duty
to shew my sense of the distinguished honour conferred on me, by
accepting the office of Rector and endeavouring to the best of my power
to discharge its duties. But it is hardly possible that such a function
could have devolved on me more inopportunely than in the circumstances
in which I am placed at the present moment, when my whole time is

hope to have completed sooner than the commencement of the Session of

le 2 Décembre 1865

Mon cher Monsieur Louis Blanc

Je ne puis m’abstenir de vous féliciter des admirables lettres que vous
écrivez au Temps sur les déplorables événements qui se sont passés en
Jamaïque, et surtout de celle qui a paru le 30 Novembre.2 Rien ne
saurait être mieux pensé ni mieux senti que cette lettre. Souhaitons
qu’il se trouvera dans le parti libéral de la chambre assez d’hommes de
coeur, non seulement pour flétrir dignement les iniquités de la
répression, mais pour exiger la punition exemplaire de leurs auteurs. Le
ministère et la chambre, voire même la nation, veut donner leur mesure.
S’ils laissent faire de pareilles énormités au nom de l’Angleterre, ils
n’auront rien à reprocher ni aux Russes en Pologne—qui n’ont jamais fait
autant—ni aux Carrier3 et Collot4 de la Révolution française.

Vos observations au le Times sont excellentes; mais on pourrait dire de
plus, que dans ce qui regarde les West Indies, ce journal ne représente
pas l’opinion publique de l’Angleterre, bien qu’il entraîne trop souvent
cette opinion. Vous avez pu remarquer qu’en tout ce qui regarde les
nègres, le Times est depuis vingt ans l’organe de l’oligarchie blanche
des West Indies. Je ne sais pas quel est l’intérêt, pécuniaire ou
social, qui le décide à se ranger Edition: current; Page: [1124] sous
cette bannière, mais le fait n’est pas douteux. Le Times n’a-t-il pas
fait, pendant de longues années, tout son possible pour forcer ou
persuader le gouvernement à retirer l’escadre anglaise des côtes de
l’Afrique?5 tentative qu’il n’a abandonnée que lorsque l’impossibilité
de réussir a été pleinement constatée. On sait toujours d’avance ce que
dira le Times dans tout cet ordre de questions: on est sûr qu’il sera du
parti le plus brutalement contraire aux noirs. Il ne serait pas sans
utilité que cette liaison du Times avec les intérêts esclavagistes fût
connue en France, où généralement on voit dans ce journal un organe de
l’opinion anglaise, sans tenir compte des impulsions spéciales et
privées qui agissent souvent sur les écrivains du Times comme sur ceux
de tout autre journal, et modifient sa mauvaise direction générale par
de mauvais caprices particuliers.

Dear Sir—

In answer to your letter of Nov. 29, I would say, that restrictions on
marriage, or on any other human action when so conducted as to be
directly injurious to others than the agents themselves, do not appear
to me objectionable on the principle of Liberty.2 For all our actions
which affect the interests of other people I hold that we are morally, &
may without violation of principle be made legally, responsible. I have
however expressly guarded myself against being understood to mean that
legal restrictions on marriage are expedient. That is an altogether
different question, to which I conceive no universal & peremptory answer
can be given, & in deciding which for any particular case due weight
ought to be given to the probability of consequences of the kind you
mention as well as of any other kinds.

Dear Sir—

I have seen with great pleasure, in the newspapers, the movement which
the St. James’s Vestry has originated at your suggestion for the union
of all London into one body for municipal purposes, with smaller bodies
of the same sort for purposes special to each of the parliamentary
divisions.2 I have long wished that an effort in this direction should
be made. All the more important town-interests are common to the whole
town, and can only be properly attended to by a body representative of
the whole; and I quite agree with you that there should be but one such
body, and that the functions (for instance) of the Board of Trade should
merge into those of the united municipality. I also go entirely along
with the proposal to abolish the jurisdiction of the Middlesex
magistrates in the metropolis, and to have none but stipendiary
magistrates. The only point on which I do not agree with the scheme as
reported is the choice of magistrates by the citizens or the municipal
body. The proposed corporation ought, of course, to have powers equal to
those of other municipal corporations; but it seems to me that the
choice of judicial officers is best placed, not with any corporation,
but with a minister or great public functionary, who can be held
responsible for making a proper choice. As a general rule, skilled
professional officers are hardly ever well chosen by numbers; some one
person must make it his business to find them and judge of their
qualifications. I do not know if this view of the question has been
under your consideration, or that of the vestry; but as I hope to aid in
bringing your plan before Parliament, I am glad to begin already an
interchange of sentiment with you on the subject.3

of it all, not even the Reform Bill, more important than the duty of
dealing justly with the abominations committed in Jamaica.4 If England
lets off the perpetrators with an inadequate punishment, no Englishman

Dear Sir—

Your letter dated Nov 3 has been forwarded to me here. It would be a
great satisfaction to me to be able to give any assistance in the
struggle which the enlightened friends of Free Trade have to maintain
against, I am sorry to say, many Americans whose opinions & feelings on
other matters Edition: current; Page: [1127] command my warmest
sympathies. I do not despair of being able, some time hence, to write
something for the Chicago Tribune of the kind you wish,2 & if so I shall
esteem it a privilege to have it accepted without any payment. At
present however my time & thoughts are so fully occupied by engagements
which must be completed before the commencement of the session of Parlt
now near at hand, that I really am not able to undertake any fresh work.
What you ask me to do is not easy; I hardly know any point in Pol.
Economy which it is more difficult to treat popularly, & so as to carry
persuasion to those who have not studied the subject, than that one, of
the influence of high & low wages on foreign trade. To understand the
matter it is necessary to realize the fact that all trade is in reality
barter—that the question is not whether the home capitalist shall
produce or not, but whether he shall produce one thing or another—cotton
fabrics, for instance, or wheat; & that high wages which must equally be
paid in either case, cannot place one of these two modes of employing
his capital at any disadvantage by the side of the other. If it was only
in cottonspinning that American wages were higher than English, while in
agriculture they were equal, then indeed the high wages being peculiar
to one employment would really make it more difficult, & perhaps
impossible to carry it on without a protecting duty. But in that case it
would clearly be an employment unsuited to the country, since labour
employed in it would require to be remunerated more highly than the
general rate of wages in the country.

It is very difficult to make this argument popular. What one ought to do
is, to ask, If high wages are sufficient to make the American cotton
manufacturer unable to compete with the English, how is it that the same
high wages do not prevent the American farmer from underselling the
English, unless because farming is an industry suited to the
circumstances of the country & cottonspinning not?

You are probably aware of the causes which have so long delayed my

to Edition: current; Page: [1128] have no chance of being able to visit
Saint Andrews’ for the purpose of delivering an address, at any time
when the University will be sitting, earlier than the end of January
1867, I thought it best to make this circumstance known to the students
who had done me the honour of electing me, and to be guided by their
wishes in accepting or declining the Rectorship. Being informed that,
notwithstanding this inevitable delay, it is still the wish of the
Students that I should fill the office of Rector, I beg, accordingly, to
communicate to you my acceptance of that office. I understand that this
intimation should properly be made to the Vice Chancellor.2 I am not
able, where I am, to ascertain who is the present holder of that
dignity, nor the proper form in which to make the announcement; but I
take the liberty of inclosing a communication addressed to him, and of

Dear Chadwick

I received your letter only this morning, so that if you are at Paris
tomorrow as you expected, you will not receive this answer. But as in
that case I shall probably see you at Avignon, it will not matter.

I am doubtful of any good from an inquiry moved for by Lord Elcho.2 The
sole object of its promoters will probably be to obtain such statistics
as may frighten Parliament and the electoral body into restricting the
extension of the suffrage to the narrowest limits possible. They do not
want to have Edition: current; Page: [1129] your, or my, or Mr Hare’s
plans of reform taken into consideration, and they will prevent all such
consideration if they can. Any locus standi for “crochets” and “fancy
franchises” before the Commission will have to be fought for, and fought
for against Tories, Whigs, and such Radicals as Bright. It would
therefore be in my opinion a false policy for any reformer to say to
Government or the public, Do not propose a Reform Bill, but wait for the
result of an enquiry by such men as Lord Elcho. But even if it were
competent to any other reformer to take this position, it is not so for
me. It is for those to call for an enquiry who need an enquiry, before
being willing to take action. I know what reform I want, and am ready
now to do my utmost to get it. An enquiry should be supplementary to,
and not instead of, any measure of reform that the present ministry are
likely to propose.

I am very sorry that you have had so much unpleasantness about the
Newsman, and sorry that Beal had any share in it. I was hoping that you
and he would be able to work together at the local government of London.
It is one of the many questions which incessantly make me regret that
you are not member for Westminster. I shall want to consult with you
about it, and shall miss you if you are in Algeria.3 But if you can
really help the sanitary improvement of the army, it is a thing worth
going there for.

The idea of making the rate book the register, is a good one if the only
qualification is to be one of rating, because it makes the registration
seek the elector instead of the elector the registration. But it will
not be carried, because it would take away the qualifications by
property—freehold, copyhold, and leasehold. If those qualifications are
allowed to remain, there will still be need of lawyers, and registration
associations. The whole of our laws of election from top to bottom
require to be reconstructed on new principles: but to get those
principles into people’s heads is work for many years, and they will not
wait that time for the next step in reform. If they would, all they
would get is to be told that the public is content with the thing as it
is. And perhaps some measure of reform is as likely to promote as to
delay other improvements in the representative system. I am Dear
Chadwick

.

Dear Mr Fawcett

I have delayed long to thank you for your book,2 having been very busy
writing, and unable to read it with proper attention until within these
few days.

I think the essays must have been very interesting as lectures,3 and
will be very useful as a book. The subject of the land laws, and laws of
inheritance, is very well treated, and is one of which few feel the
importance. You have broken ground very usefully on it. The
considerations you have brought forward will be much needed in the
discussions we shall soon have on Irish affairs, and the whole subject
will become much more practical after any considerable parliamentary
reform. One of the most important consequences of giving a share in the
government to the working classes, is that there will then be some
members of the House with whom it will no longer be an axiom that human
society exists for the sake of property in land—a grovelling
superstition which is still in full force among the higher classes.

I need hardly say how highly I approve your chapter on cooperation, and
the restatement of the ideas of your Westminster Review article
respecting Strikes.4 On all these subjects you have strengthened
yourself by new thoughts and illustrations; and the speculations in the
concluding chapter, on the possibilities of the future, open a class of
considerations both new and very necessary to be thought of.

The chapter which on the whole I least like is the one on wages,5 though
it will probably be more praised than any of the rest: but I think I
could shew that an increase of wages at the expense of profits would not
be an impracticability on the true principles of political economy. It
might doubtless send capital to other countries; but we must recollect
that the movement Edition: current; Page: [1131] for higher wages and
shorter working hours is now common to all the industrious nations.

There is one mistake in a matter of fact which I saw with regret in the
book, and which I hope a new edition may soon give you an opportunity of
correcting. You have entirely misunderstood the ateliers nationaux.6
They were not advances to cooperative societies, but direct payment of
wages, for work mostly nominal, from the public purse; and so far were
they from having any connexion with Louis Blanc or his opinions, that he
has always bitterly complained of them, as having been set up, not for,
but against him and his plans. The member of the Provincial Government
principally responsible for them was, he says, M. Marie.7 The advances
to associations of workmen were quite another matter, and did none of
the harm which the ateliers nationaux did—probably even some good: at
all events the Government could not have refused such experimental aid
when the associations thought that they could not get on without it. I
am not certain that such advances (resembling those the Crédit Mobilier8
makes to a richer class) would not sometimes be useful even now: though
it is one of the lessons of the experience of that time that in most
cases the associations which did without subsidies prospered the most.

There are some misprints in the volume, especially ‘married men’ for
‘monied men’ at p.209, and Arsène Haussage for Houssaye9 (p.103).

We shall now soon meet on our common field of battle. The two great
topics of the year will be Jamaica10 and Reform,11 and there will be an
immensity to be said and done on both subjects. I have just seen with
great pleasure that Lord Hobart has come out decidedly in McMillan’s for
Hare’s system.12 It is gradually taking hold of one after another of the
thinking men; of whom Lord Hobart is decidedly one. I shall perhaps
invoke your aid on the Metropolitan government question,13 of the
burthen of which I shall probably have to take a considerable share.

Dear Sir

It is a favourable sign of the impression which the idea of Personal
Representation is making not only on the best thinkers but on thinking
persons of all degrees that I should have received such a letter as the
one I inclose.2 The objections to the plan proposed by the writer, you
will not need me to point out; but he shews that his mind has worked on
the subject, and many minds like his are probably by this time doing the
same.

I was delighted to read Lord Hobart’s complete and most intelligent
adhesion in the new number of McMillan.3 His is about the best
theoretical head in the whole nobility. What a pity that he holds an
office which excludes him from the House of Commons.

In a letter I have just received from M. Morin,4 he tells me that
through the impression made by Naville,5 and in consequence of the
victory of the Independent Party in the late elections, there is some
chance of an actual trial of Personal Representation in the choice of
the four deputies whom Geneva elects to the National Council of
Switzerland.6 This, it seems, can be done by the authority of the
ordinary legislature: while the mode of election of the cantonal
authorities can only be changed by a Constituent Assembly, or by a
general assembly of the citizens. But if the trial is made in the one
case, and succeeds, its application to the other will probably soon
follow. And if made at all, the trial is pretty sure to be a true and
fair one, with Naville to direct it.

I begin to think that you or I may live to see the plan in actual
operation in England, or at all events in America.

There are at least Hughes and Fawcett who I hope will help me to bring
it before the House of Commons in the approaching discussions on reform.

Dear Sir—

With regard to the question of stereotyping the book on Comte, if I
revise the book well before it is reprinted, it is hardly likely that
any further alterations will be urgently required. It may, however, be
desirable after a time to publish a cheap edition; but stereotyping need
not I suppose prevent this as it could be done by merely lowering the
price. If therefore you decidedly prefer stereotyping I have no
objection. In that case I shd be obliged by your telling me what you
would be disposed to give, either in the form of so much a year, or so
much for every 1000 copies sold, or a sum down for a fixed number of
years or of copies. It would be well also to fix some number of years,
or of copies sold, after which the copyright & the stereotype plates
should revert to me or my representatives.

I thank you for your offer of a payment on account, but I should prefer
to wait for any payment till the accounts of the first edition are made
out & the pecuniary result ascertained.

Jan. 6. 1866

Dear Sir

It seems a long time since I either heard from you or wrote to you. As
the time approaches when I shall be taking part in the discussion of
pending questions, I feel an increasing desire to take counsel with you
concerning some of them.

One is the question of the Irish Colleges. I have been drawing nearer
and nearer to your view of that subject,2 practically considered, though
I am not sure that we quite agree yet about the amount of concession
required by equal justice. I shall take my stand against the
denominational system in any form for Ireland—regarding it as a mere
concession to practical difficulties even in England, and in Ireland
inadmissible altogether. I am prepared to maintain that no public
assistance ought to be given in Ireland to any education Edition:
current; Page: [1134] involving more or other religious teaching than
exists in the mixed, or national system. I also think that in Ireland it
is so great a point to bring youths of different religions to live
together in colleges, as will justify almost any encouragement to the
system of the Queen’s University, except that of actually refusing
degrees to those who have studied elsewhere. From what I see in
newspapers and hear, I am in hopes that the Catholic prelacy is shewing
itself so impracticable as to give the Government a fair ground for
withdrawing any offers they may have made, if only they can be induced
to think such a retraction desirable: and it must be the business of
members of Parliament to try to make them think so. Do you know of any
member likely to lead the opposition on your side? What do you think of
M’Cullagh Torrens?3 He, most likely, agrees with you, and he is one of
the few Irishmen in Parliament who are not incumbered with an Irish
constituency. Do you know what views Neate4 takes of the question? Any
tolerable stand made in the House will have powerful support outside,
from the mass of feeling in the country always ready to be called forth
against any new concession to Catholics.

Then comes the Land Question. I have read several of your letters in the
Economist,5 and admired them greatly. The generalities of the question
have perhaps never before been so well stated as in your first letter.
But your conclusion seems to me to fall far short of your premises. It
may be that this is unavoidable. But the remedy of permitting the tenant
to carry away or destroy his improvements, will surely do very little
for him. It is monstrous that the law, at present, should not permit him
to do this. But supposing that abominable state of the law to be
altered, how inconsiderable would be the advantage to the tenant. 1st.
If, as is generally the case, the landlord’s object is to clear the
estate and consolidate the holdings, the tenant by pulling down his
buildings is merely doing the landlord’s work gratis. 2dly. The cases
most of all deserving compensation, are those in which the tenant has
actually reclaimed the land: and how can he put it back into the state
of heath or bog in which it was before? 3dly. Even when the improvement
consisted in putting something on the farm which can be carried away
such as buildings or fences—to remove them would make no return to the
farmer for the labour or cost of putting them up, but would merely give
him the value of the materials; and what are they? earth or rough
stones: seldom worth even the Edition: current; Page: [1135] trouble of
carrying away. It would be his interest to accept the most trifling
offer from the landlord, rather than exercise his right: unless indeed
his motive was a vindictive one; and he would have but little even of
that kind of satisfaction, for he could in general do the landlord as
little harm as he could do himself good.

I am disposed to make a much greater claim for the tenant—to demand for
him, not compensation for his outlay, but a full equivalent for the
additional value which either by his labour or his expenditure he has
given to the land: to be assessed either by a special tribunal or by
arbitration. Justice requires no less than this, and its
impracticability is not, to my mind, made out. But, as I am afraid you
are of a different opinion, I should like very much to compare notes
with you on the subject.

I am Dear Sir
 very truly yours

Jan. 7, 1866

Dear Chapman

Your letter of June 18 reached me just before leaving England for
Avignon, where I have been during the whole time, which, as you
mentioned, Mrs Chapman and your younger children were to pass in
London.2 I consequently have not seen them; but I shall hope to see your
son who is to remain in England,3 as well as his brother who was already
there.4 I have had less intercourse with your eldest son than I had
hoped and intended to have, owing to the great engrossment of my time
when in England by occupations which you can well appreciate: and now
there is more on my hands than ever, and I have so many calls upon every
moment of time that I am obliged to seem negligent of old friends, and
almost to avoid making new ones. But I am not the less desirous to be of
use to any one connected with you, and if I seem inattentive, it is not
owing to indifference.

It must be very interesting to you to renew your knowledge of British
New Zealand after an interval which bears so considerable a proportion
to its short history.5 England has heard much of New Zealand these few
years, and in a Edition: current; Page: [1136] manner far from
agreeable. Thoughtful people have found it hard to make up their minds
on the New Zealand aspect of the universal colonial question—what to do
with the aborigines. It was hoped that this would be a less desperate
difficulty in New Zealand than elsewhere, on account of the higher
qualities and more civilisable character of the Maoris. But the eternal
source of quarrel, the demand of the colonists for land, has defeated
these hopes; and it seems as if, unless or until the progressive decline
of the Maori population ends in their extinction, the country would be
divided between two races always hostile in mind, if not always in
actual warfare. Here, then, is the burthen on the conscience of
legislators at home. Can they give up the Maoris to the mercy of the
more powerful, & constantly increasing, section of the population?
Knowing what the English are, when they are left alone with what they
think an inferior race, I cannot reconcile myself to this. But again—is
it possible for England to maintain an authority there for the purpose
of preventing unjust treatment of the Maoris, and at the same time allow
self government to the British colonists in every other respect? How is
that one subject to be kept separate, and how is the Governor to be in
other things a mere ornamental frontispiece to a government of the
colony by a colonial Cabinet and Legislature, and to assume a will and
responsibility of his own, overruling his cabinet and legislature
wherever the Maoris are concerned? If the condition of colonial
government is, to keep well with the colonial population and its
representatives, there is no hindering the colonists from making their
cooperation depend on compliance with their wishes as to the Maoris. I
do not see my way through these difficulties. Nor do I feel able to
judge what would be the consequence of leaving the colonists, without
the aid of Queen’s troops, to settle the Maori difficulty in their own
way. Perhaps the proofs which the Maoris have given that they can be
formidable enemies may have produced towards them in the colonists a
different state of mind from the overbearing and insolent disregard of
the rights and feelings of inferiors which is the common characteristic
of John Bull when he thinks he cannot be resisted. On all these
questions I am now under a special public obligation to make up my mind,
and I hope to be helped to do so by your knowledge and experience. The
information your letters are always full of, will be often valuable to
me now.

Your account of the Middle Island and its impassable range of high Alps,
is very attractive to me, and if New Zealand were an island in the
Northern Atlantic, would speedily send me on a visit there. The very
idea of anything impassable and impenetrable is almost too charming, now
when every nook and corner of our planet has got or is getting opened to
the full light of day. One of the many causes which make the age we are
living in so very important in the life of the human race—almost,
indeed, the turning point of it—is that so many things combine to make
it the era of a great change in the Edition: current; Page: [1137]
conceptions and feelings of mankind as to the world of which they form a
part. There is now almost no place left on our own planet that is
mysterious to us, and we are brought within sight of the practical
questions which will have to be faced when the multiplied human race
shall have taken full possession of the earth (and exhausted its
principal fuel). Meanwhile we are also acquiring scientific convictions
as to the future destination of suns and stars, and the whole visible
universe. These things must have ultimately a very great effect on human
character. You have read Buckle’s remarks on the effect of the aspects
of nature in different parts of the earth, upon the mental
characteristics, and thence on the social development of the different
nations.6 One begins to see a long vista of effects, of analogous origin
but very different, on the future generations of mankind. Even without
looking to anything so distant, or going beyond the proximate effects of
social and economical causes already in operation, some thinkers are
beginning to speculate on what will happen when the agricultural
labourers of England shall have followed those of Ireland to America;
and are asking themselves whether we shall have to import Chinese to
supply the vacancy. The most certain result that I foresee from all
this, is that English statesmanship will have to assume a new character,
and to look in a more direct way than before to the interests of
posterity. We are now, I think, standing on the very boundary line
between this new statesmanship and the old; and the next generation will

Dear Sir—

When I have disposed of the second edition of any of my books for a
fixed sum, I have always hitherto had more for it than the amount of the
half profit I had derived from the first. I think I might reasonably
look for £70 for the second ed. of the Comte—the half profit on the
first ed. to be Edition: current; Page: [1138] paid when it is all sold
& the £70 on the publication of the second. If you agree to this I
accept your proposal regarding the remainder of the 5000 copies, on the
understanding that the reduced price commences after the sale of the
second thousand.

I have to thank you for sending me a number of the Contemporary Review.2

Will you be so kind as to send Count Gurowski’s book3 to my house,
Blackheath Park, at any convenient time in the course of the month.

TO THOMAS HARE1

Saint Véran, Avignon

Jan. 11. 1866

Dear Sir

It is not so clear to me as it is to you, that we ought to desire that
the Government measure of reform should include nothing but an extension
of the suffrage. No doubt there might be advantage in obtaining that
first, if there were a reasonable prospect of getting anything else
afterwards; but is there such a prospect? I can see none. If Bright’s
doctrine2 is accepted by public opinion and acted on by the Government,
it may be assumed as certain that no other point of parliamentary reform
will be allowed to be discussed this year. No party in the House would
tolerate it: whoever attempted it would speak to empty benches—would
probably be counted out. And it is to my mind equally indubitable that
when any reform has been passed the whole subject of changes in the
representation will be tabooed for years to come. Most of the liberal
members are not real reformers, and only vote for any reform because
they are obliged, and in the hope of getting rid of the question. You
seem to think that while the House is passing a bill confined to the one
point, it might be induced to appoint a Committee to enquire into the
best means of “liberating and stimulating individual thought and
action.” But what is to be the inducement? Are there six persons in the
House of Edition: current; Page: [1139] Commons who think it any
business of theirs to liberate and stimulate individual thought and
action, or who would desire to do so even if they knew what it meant?
How many are there even outside the House, who would support a motion
for such a Committee? The small number who are already converts to your
plan; not a man beside. To nobody else would such a proposal carry any
distinct meaning; still less represent anything that to their minds
would appear sensible or practical. I admit that our prospects are
nearly as bad if Lord Russell does include something else in his bill,
as if he does not. Little as the chance is of an early reopening of
parliamentary reform after the bill has passed, it will probably be
sooner reopened for a readjustment of seats than merely for personal
representation. This I cannot deny; but in the meanwhile we lose the
opportunity of discussing personal representation in the present
session—an opportunity which could not be refused to us if the whole
subject of representation were on the tapis, but which we certainly
shall not have if the question at issue is, by a previous understanding
between the two great parties, confined to the extension of the
franchise. I have given you my impression on the subject; but I cannot
feel complete confidence in its correctness when I see yours to be
different.

I shall be delighted to read your paper in the Fortnightly Review3 when
I return to Blackheath. Were it sent here I probably should not receive
it. The Pall Mall Gazette you kindly sent, never arrived. The Daily News
was stopped four times in the six days of last week; and for about two
months past, we have never received both the Spectator and the Saturday
Review—very often neither. What has happened to increase the rigour of
the French Government to the foreign press, I do not know; but there is
certainly something. You doubtless noticed the interdiction of the
Indépendance Belge,4 and of the principal liberal German papers, and the
principle on which it was rested. If that principle means anything, it
means the exclusion of all my English papers, except the Times which,
for reasons best known to itself, is never seized.

I agree with you about Lorimer’s book.5 It is merely a weaker repetition
of his former one.

I shall be very desirous to discuss with you all the points of London
municipal Edition: current; Page: [1140] reform, in which I shall have
to take an active part. Beal6 told me that you had sent him “a little
work” of your own7 “full of good matter on the question.”

importance of preserving as much as possible of such free space for

of Edition: current; Page: [1141] population and cultivation has still
left to us. The desire to engross the whole surface of the earth in the
mere production of the greatest possible quantity of food & the
materials of manufacture, I consider to be founded on a mischievously
narrow conception of the requirements of human nature. I therefore

par rapport au bois. J’ose encore, messieurs, vous demander la
permission de conserver ces arbres, sans en faire la coupe; mais dans le

I am much obliged to you for sending me your Social Science paper,2 and
the article on Cobden3—the former I had read, Mr. Storr4 having kindly
Edition: current; Page: [1142] given me a copy, but I am glad to have
one from yourself. The subject of it is one of the most interesting and
important of the practical matters now before the public. Many things
are pointing to a strong, and I hope a combined movement for the
improvement of the dwellings of the working classes which will need all
our exertions to forward it. I agree with you as to the necessity of
some legislative measure to facilitate the procurement of sites; and I
attach the same importance as you do to enabling working classes to be
proprietors of their own dwellings. I hope you are on the Committee
appointed by the Social Science Association, and are in communication
with Mr Hare who has, as you know, given great attention to the subject,
and who [has] a particularly strong opinion on this point.

My constituents have hitherto been very forbearing with me, but those
who have exerted themselves in the manner you and others have done for

improvements, have the best possible claim on my time and attention when
they have any improvements to propose. I beg that you will never scruple

I regret that Mrs Austin should have had any annoyance or anxiety on the
subject of the missing Notes of Lectures.2 They never were in her
possession, having unfortunately been lent by me and lost by the
borrower within a year or two after the Lectures were delivered.

The Notes were written next day from memoranda made by myself in the
Lecture Room; and Mr Austin’s slow delivery and splendid articulation
made it easy to report all the important passages nearly in his exact
words. By these means I had the good fortune to preserve many valuable
oral elucidations. Edition: current; Page: [1143] There was only one
lecture (I forget which one) at which I was unable to be present, and in
that case Mr Austin kindly lent me his manuscript to enable me to fill
up the vacancy. I never saw the MS of any of the others, nor did he see
any of the Notes.

Unless I write now to thank you for your admirable article in the
Westminster Review,2 I do not know when I shall be able to do so, as my
time is already taken up, to a degree which you can very well understand
both from theory and experience, though my constituents have hitherto
given me very little trouble of any kind, and that little only for
important objects. I write, then, while I can, to express some part of
the pleasure it gives me that one whose good opinion and good feeling I
value more than that of any other living man, should be able to write
about me in the way you have done.3 I thank you, too, most heartily, for
the justice you have done to my father.4 When your Kleine Schriften come
to be collected, that passage will remain as one of the weightiest
testimonies to his worth, and to the place he filled in his generation.

As to the points of difference between us on some minor matters of
opinion, which occur in the course of the article, it will be a pleasure
to talk them over with you some day. There is only one of them on which
I yet see myself to have been wrong, viz. when I spoke of a beginning
without a cause as being inconceivable by us. Of course, however, I did
not mean inconceivable by a law of the mind, but only by an acquired
association.

Edition: current; Page: [1145]
Have you seen Mansel’s critique (for I am told it is his) in Nos 1 and 2
of a new publication called the Contemporary Review?5 I should like much
to know what you think of it, if you have read it.

My article on the Plato6 is in Reeve’s hands and accepted by him; which
is a relief to me, as its length so much exceeds the usual Edinburgh
Review dimensions, that I feared he might be unwilling to insert it
without an impossible curtailment. I have seldom given so much time and
pains to a review article, but it has been well employed if I have done
any tolerable justice to the subject.

Dear Sir:—

On arriving here last week, I found the December livraison of your
Biology, and I need hardly say how much I regretted the announcement in
the paper annexed to it.2 What the case calls for, however, is not only
regret, but remedy; and I think it is right you should be indemnified by
the readers and purchasers of the series for the loss you have incurred
by it. I should be glad to contribute my part, and should like to know
at how much you estimate the loss, and whether you will allow me to
speak to friends and obtain subscriptions for the remainder. My own
impression is that the sum ought to be raised among the original
subscribers.

In the next place, I cannot doubt that the publication in numbers,
though it may have been the best means that presented itself at the
time, has had an unfavourable effect on the sale, and that a complete
treatise with your name to it would attract more attention, obtain more
buyers, and would be pretty sure to sell an edition in a few years. What
I propose is that you should write the next of your treatises, and that
I should guarantee the publisher against loss, i.e., should engage,
after such length of time as may be agreed on, to Edition: current;
Page: [1146] make good any deficiency that may occur, not exceeding a
given sum, that sum being such as the publisher may think sufficient to
insure him. With this guarantee you could have your choice of
publishers, and I do not think it likely that there would be any loss,
while I am sure that it could in no case be considerable. I beg that you
will not consider this proposal in the light of a personal favour,
though even if it were I should still hope to be permitted to offer it.
But it is nothing of the kind—it is a simple proposal of cooperation for
an important public purpose, for which you give your labour and have
given your health.

To take your last subject first. I have of late avoided giving my name
to any of the Working Classes’ Exhibitions,2 as it seems to me that the
thing is rather overdone; so many of these Exhibitions are now attempted
that they stand in each other’s way, are apt to be unsuccessful in a
pecuniary sense, and excite but little of the interest which was felt
about the first things of the Edition: current; Page: [1147] kind. If it
would oblige you that I should give my name to the North London
Exhibition I will very willingly do so on that account; but there is
very little chance that my daughter and I can be present at the opening,
or at any time during the exhibition, as we are almost sure to be abroad
at the time.

Allow me to congratulate you on being Editor of the Family Paper,3 both
as a rise in your position, and a great increase in the comfort of your
daily work. I thank you for the pleasant things you have written about
me in the Sydney Morning Herald,4 and for the letter on reform which you
purpose addressing to me: Would it not be worth while to write it so
that it might be published either in the Family Paper, the Working Man,5
or somewhere else? as a statement of the ideas of the best part of the
working classes on reform would be important and interesting to many
persons besides me.

Many thanks for the cuttings. I have seen Mr Conway’s article6 and the

Feb. 13. 1866

Dear Sir

Your news is very important, and the move of the Presbyterian body
promises well,2 if the Government is not yet irrevocably committed.3 I,
on my side, have talked with Mr Grant Duff,4 who said he could hardly
believe that the Government can meditate such a step as the one we
apprehend. Not a single Scotch member (he said) would vote with them,
and (he added) as their enemies are keenly watching to take the first
opportunity of putting them in a minority they would probably be obliged
to resign. The result of this and of much other information that reaches
me, is to make me apprehensive that we may be more successful than we
desire, and may perhaps break up the Ministry and lose the Reform Bill.
This is not a sufficient reason against fighting the question of the
Colleges to the utmost; but I attach great importance to not being
supposed to have the smallest approach to an understanding or concert
with those who will merely use our question as a means of effecting
purposes which we should greatly lament. Nothing can be more proper than
that you should apply to any and every influential politician whom you
can get access to; but I am very anxious not to be held out to any one,
even to sincere liberals, and much less to false liberals or Tories, as
desiring to communicate with them on the subject. I have no objection to
its being said to any person whatever, that I have a very strong opinion
against the proposed changes. If any M.P. (even a Tory) chooses to open
the subject to me, I will tell him my mind. One or two members have
already done so; Mr Lowe5 did so the very day I saw you, and I thought
he seemed disposed to take the initial step (by putting a question to
the Government) without any further parley or consultation with us and
our liberal friends. It is most clear to me that we, meaning myself and
the other liberal members you mention, should endeavour to act directly
on the members of the Government, and should avoid even the appearance
of concert with any Edition: current; Page: [1149] of those who would
like to do them an ill turn. With regard to Sir Hugh Cairns,6 or any one
on that side of the house, whatever they may choose to do should be
quite apart from us. The same political instinct which influenced Lord
Stanley,7 would probably make them feel that they had better appear as
seconders than as originators of a move on this subject.

Many thanks for the pamphlet, which will be very useful to me.

Feb. 26, 1866

Dear Sir—

I have to acknowledge a letter from you dated Feb. 15 asking me to
explain a passage of my Principles of Pol. Economy2 in which I express
the opinion that a protecting duty, for a limited space of time, may be
defensible in a new country, as a means of naturalizing a branch of
industry in itself suited to the country but which would be unable to
establish itself there without some form of temporary assistance from
the state. This passage you say has been made use of by American
protectionists as the testimony of an English writer on Pol. Economy to
the inapplicability to America of the general principle of free trade.
The passage has been used for a similar purpose in the Australian
colonies,3 erroneously in my opinion but certainly with more
plausibility than can be the case in the U. States; for Australia really
is a new country whose capabilities for carrying on manufactures cannot
yet be said to have been tested: but the manufacturing parts of the
U.S., New England & Pennsylvania, are no longer new countries; they have
carried on manufacturing on a large scale, & with the benefit of high
protecting duties for at least two generations; their operatives have
had full time to acquire the manufacturing skill in which those of
England had preceded them; & there has been ample experience to prove
that the inability of their manufactures to compete in the American
market with those of Great Britain does not arise merely from the more
recent date of their establishment, but from the fact that American
labour & capital can in the present circumstances of America be employed
with greater return & greater advantage to the national wealth, in the
production of other articles. I have never for a moment recommended or
countenanced any protecting duty except for the purpose of enabling the
protected branch of industry, in a very moderate time, to become
independent of protection. That moderate time in the U. States has been
exceeded, & if the cotton or iron of America still need protection
against those of the other hemisphere it is in my eyes a complete proof
that they ought not to have it, & that the longer it is continued the
greater the injustice & the waste of national resources will be.

I confine myself on the present occasion to the one special point which
you have referred to me & do not enter into the fallacies of
Protectionism generally Edition: current; Page: [1151] or of American
Protectionists in particular. But since you pay me the compliment of
thinking that what is said on the subject in my Pr. of P.E. is read &
listened to by some Americans, I beg to recommend to your notice the
further explanations which I have added to the passage quoted by you in
the last published (the People’s) edition of that work.4 I have directed
the publisher to send you a copy & if the important journal with which
you are connected, is pleased to attach any value to my opinion on the
subject, that opinion will be found much more completely stated, with
additional replies to Protectionist arguments in pp. 556 to 558 of the
People’s edition.

Dear Sir—

Your idea of a collected edition of my writings has much to recommend
it, & I have sometimes thought of such a thing myself, but was inclined
to think that the most suitable time would be after my death, as I am
likely, so long as I live, to make material improvements in every new
edition of my larger works. This objection however might be got over.
But do you not think that the publication of such a series—each volume
of which would of course be obtainable separate from the others—would
almost entirely stop the sale of the current library editions of which,
in the case of the Logic & Pol. Econ. the greater number of the copies
are still on hand. Would it not, therefore, be best to adjourn the
project of a collected edition until these editions are nearly sold?

It is satisfactory to find that the People’s Editions have not so much
damaged as might have been expected the sale of the library editions.
But the Edition: current; Page: [1153] edition you propose would
probably compete with the library editions much more successfully.

me much satisfaction to find that so great a number of them are in the
habit of giving intelligent attention to the foreign policy of the

encumbered with great difficulties; and though if Mr. Gregory2 had
divided the House I should have voted against him, I am not satisfied
that the immunity of private property from capture would not on the
whole be for the advantage if the Declaration of Paris3 must be
maintained.

I agree with you in thinking this last the really important question,
and I am decidedly of opinion that the relinquishment by the naval
Powers of their most powerful weapon of defence against the great
military Powers,4 can only be defended if it be true that the change of
circumstances has made that weapon one which could no longer safely be

Reform Bill I shall hold myself ready to return at a day’s notice in
order to take part in it.

Probably however it may be thought that the first day after the recess,
Monday 9th April, will be as good or even a better day for a political

Whatever may be determined on this point, I am in the hands of my

TO JOHN CAMPBELL1

Avignon

April 4, 1866

Dear Sir—

The supposition that I approve of the bill empowering Govt to make loans
for the improvement of the dwellings of the working classes is quite
correct.2 If I thought that such a measure would injure the independence
of the working classes or encourage their improvidence I shd strenuously
oppose it. But the case seems to me to be one of a class of cases in
which people require artificial help, to enable them afterwards to help
themselves. The taste for better house accommodation has still to be
created: & until it is created, private speculation will not find its
account in supplying that improved accommodation. The aid of Govt is
often useful, & sometimes necessary, to start improved systems which
once started are able to keep themselves going without further help. I
support loans from the public for the purpose in question (which is
still more important morally than even physically) as I would support
similar loans for the purpose of creating peasant proprietors, or (if
necessary for the purpose) in aid of colonization. I think however that
the loans ought not to be accessible only to Town Councils, but Edition:
current; Page: [1156] also to building companies or private capitalists
under strict conditions & on proper security; and the Bill introduced by
the Govt gives, I believe, the power of making such advances.

Dear Sir

Your note of the 29th reached me at Avignon, but I could not answer it
until my return here enabled me to tell you if Mr Sullivan’s pamphlet2
had been sent to me or not. I find that it has, and I have lost no time
in reading it. After doing so, my opinion decidedly is that it requires
an answer. It is written with some ability, and knowledge of detail; it
does not manifestly exhibit want of candour, and as it makes some points
on matters of fact, with apparent success (though none which are
essential to the question) it will be largely used in the discussions,
and will be represented as a complete answer to you3 and Whittle.4 There
should, I think, be a reply to it in print if only to supply those who
fight the battle in Parliament with answers to what will be brought
against them. The fight will be a more arduous one than we thought; for
several of the leading Tories, in the debate on Tests,5 shewed a
disposition to adopt denominational instead of mixed education, and
exhibited a decided sympathy with the movement of the Catholic bishops.
If you reply, I have not the least objection to its being, as you
propose, in the form of a letter to me.6

I am obliged to stop short, being very busy, as you may suppose at such

My answer to your note respecting Dr Löwe2 has been delayed by the
necessity of finding time to rummage old papers in order to ascertain
whether an impression I had of having already consented to a similar
proposal from some other quarter, was well founded or not. I now find
that in December 1861 I gave my assent to a translation of my book on
Repr. Govt by a Dr F. A. Wille,3 who like Dr Löwe, had been engaged in
the political events of 1848 & had for ten years afterwards been living
in Switzerland. Dr Wille then informed me that his translation was
partly printed & I am almost sure that it was published in the course of
the following years. If a copy was sent to me I have it not at hand, but
Dr Löwe could probably inform himself on the subject without difficulty.
Dr Wille’s address at that time was Mariafeld (sic), Meilen, Zürich.

Please thank Mrs Carlyle for her remembrance of me. I have been sorry to
hear a rather poor account of her health4 & to see by your Edinburgh
address5 that your own is not quite satisfactory.6

On my return to England I did not forget the promise in my letter of
Dec. 21, but addressed myself to one of the highest statistical
authorities in this country, Mr Newmarch, the associate of Mr Tooke in
the later volumes of his admirable History of Prices,2 and a man of mark
among our economists; that he is a warm freetrader I need not say. Mr
Newmarch has furnished me with some publications in which you will find
a great deal of the information Edition: current; Page: [1159] you want
respecting the operation of free trade in this country, and with a full
review of the commercial history of the last year, forming a Supplement
to the Economist newspaper of March 10,3 and written by himself. These I
will immediately send (probably through Mr Trübner) to the New York
address you gave me. I fear the unsatisfactory state of the
reconstruction question, and the differences between Congress and the
President, may delay for some time the progress which might otherwise
have taken place more rapidly on the freetrade question. But every
awakening of the national mind is sure to be favourable to the removal
of prejudice; and I have no doubt that, if not a complete, yet a very
considerable reform of the legislation on this subject, will before many
years reward the exertions of yourself and the other enlightened men who
have taken up the cause.

greatest success I could hope for was to throw in a sufficient number of

repetition of them to have in some small degree the value of a
confirmation by an independent inquirer.

Was I not lucky in being able to quote so capital a Platonic passage
from Max Müller?2

I suppose you have read the review of your book in Fraser which was
unfortunately the last production of Dr Whewell.3 So far as he differed
from you he always seemed to me to be wrong; but it was very pleasant to

Your report of the sale of the books is extremely satisfactory—in the

preparation for a third, whether this is published separately or as part
of the collected edition you propose.

In regard to the collected edition the difficulty occurs to me, that it
cannot at present be complete in consequence of the interest which Mr.
Trübner has in the reprint of the essays on Comte. This seems to be a
reason (in addition to others) for at least postponing the project until
the sale of the book on Comte has considerably slackened, which it is
sure before long to do; I am at present inclined to put off the subject
& to take it into consideration a year hence with a view to Jan. 1st

Madam,—

I am happy to hear that you and other ladies are disposed to assert your
just claim to be represented in the body that taxes you, and I recommend
to you to lose no opportunity of doing so. When men who wish to remove
the invidious distinctions under which you labour offer arguments
founded on the evident justice of your cause, we are constantly met by
the reply that ladies themselves see no hardship in it, and do not care
enough for the franchise to ask for it. I am glad to be able to say that
I know several members of Parliament who wish to grant the franchise
without distinction of sex, but I know many more who would be ashamed to
refuse it if it were quietly and steadily demanded by women themselves.
I am sorry to find that you disclaim being strong-minded, because I
believe strength of mind to be Edition: current; Page: [1164] one of the
noblest gifts that any rational creature, male or female, can possess,
and the best measure of our degree of efficiency for working in the
cause of truth. But such mental powers and energies as we any of us do
possess, ought to be employed in striving to remove the evils with which
circumstances have made us acquainted; and a woman who is a taxpayer is
the most natural and most suitable advocate of the political
enfranchisement of women. I hope, therefore, that you will endeavour to
strengthen the hands of those (and I know more than one) who have
devoted their lives to working in your cause, by protesting against the
injustice you suffer, whenever and wherever you can, both in society,
and when occasion offers in public. If you could yourself write a
petition (almost in the terms of your letter to me), and procure as many
signatures to it as you can, I should be happy to present it to
Parliament.2

Dear Sir,

I am afraid you must have thought hard things of me for being so slow in
answering your very friendly and most interesting letter of February
1st. Had your introduction to Mr. Holmes2 not already been sent, but
depended on my answer, I should have written at once, if even only a
line, to say how glad I should be both to see and know him, both as his
father’s3 son, as your friend, and as one whose personal history has
already been such as your letter intimates. Among the countless and
inexhaustible blessings which you, from your national struggle, will in
the end bring forth for the human race, it is one of the greatest that
they have behind them so many who, being what your friend was, have done
what he has done. Such men are the natural leaders of the democracy of
the world from this time forward; and such a series of events, coming
upon minds prepared by previous high culture, may well have ripened
Edition: current; Page: [1165] their intellects, as it cannot but have
fitted their characters, for stepping into that vacant post and filling
it with benefit to the world.

The new struggle, in which you are now engaged, that of reconstruction,
is well fitted to carry on the work of educating the political mind of
the country. I have learnt to have great trust in the capability of the
American people at large (outside the region of slavery) to see the
practical leanings of a political question truly and rapidly when the
critical moment comes. It seems to me that things are going on as well
and as fast as could be hoped for under the untoward accident of getting
an obstinate Southern man, a pro-slavery man almost to the last, in the
position of President.4 But the passing of the Civil Rights Bill5 over
his head seems almost to ensure the right issue to the contest. If you
only keep the Southern States out of Congress till they one by one
either grant negro suffrage or consent to come in on the basis of their
electoral population alone, they may probably then be let in in safety.
But the real desideratum (in addition to colonization from the North) is
the Homestead law which you propose for the negroes.6 I cannot express
too strongly the completeness of my agreement with all you say on that
point. Compared with these great questions, free trade is but a
secondary matter; but it is a good sign that this also has benefited by
the general impulse given to the national mind, and that the free
traders are raising themselves for vigorous efforts. I am not anxious
that this question should be forced on while the others are pending; for
anything which might detach the Western from the Eastern States, and
place them in even partial sympathy with the South, would at present be
a great calamity.

I have often during the years since we met in Vienna7 wished that I
could talk with you, but always found something more urgent to do than
to resort to the unsatisfactory mode of communication by letter, and
this is still more the case now that I have allowed new and onerous
duties to be placed upon me. They are not nearly so agreeable to myself,
and it remains to be seen whether they will be as useful as that of
writing out my best thoughts and putting them into print. I have a
taller pulpit now, but one in which it is impossible to use my best
materials. But jacta est alea, I must make the best I can of it; and I
have had thus far much more of what is called success than I could have
hoped for beforehand.

May 21. 1866

My dear Lord

The Reform Bill of the Government is no doubt a kind of makeshift which
it would be difficult for persons of my opinions to defend as being the
best thing in itself, and in the detail of which many improvements might
be suggested, if it could be done without damaging the chance which the
Bill has of getting through Parliament. Among other things,
representation of minorities would be an immense improvement in this, as
it would in any other scheme of representation. But supposing it
desirable that such a proposal should be made in the House of Commons, I
am not the right person to make it, in the shape to which you give the
preference.2 If I were to originate any move for representation of
minorities, it could only be in the form which alone, as I conceive,
carries out the principle, that of Mr Hare’s system; which I believe to
be practicable, though I am aware that you are of a different opinion.
My inability to originate a proposal for the cumulative vote plan (which
I regard as the next best) would be no hindrance to my supporting it if
proposed by others. But I could only do so in the cases in which the
constituency returns three members. There is, no doubt, much truth in
your remark that where the two parties are of nearly equal strength,
there is less injustice in giving one member to each than two members to
the one which is slightly the most numerous, and none at all to the
other. But it seems to me indispensable in the future interest of the
principle of representation of minorities (which is particularly liable
to be misunderstood and misrepresented) that a broad line should be
drawn between it and any plan which makes a minority politically equal
to a majority; and that this last should be absolutely disclaimed, as
going beyond and in opposition to the principle. Unless this is done,
the democrats of the old one-sided school3 will succeed in making the
principle unpopular as an aristocratic contrivance to neutralise the
extension of the Edition: current; Page: [1170] franchise: though in
truth it is exactly as much democratic as aristocratic, its effect being
to limit the tyranny of the strongest power, whatever this happens to
be.

I do not see, therefore, how I can in any direct way promote the object
you have in view. I am

My dear Sir

Your letter found me yesterday at the further extremity of Somersetshire
where I was wandering about the woody and heathy hills, to the great
benefit of my health, and had arranged to continue doing so the whole
week; not without having ascertained from Mr Brand2 that in his opinion
a vote more or less would be of no consequence on Thursday or Friday.

I go entirely along with nearly the whole of your paper:3 on a point or
two I need some further explanation which you could probably give in
five minutes conversation at any convenient opportunity. It is quite
clear that the objection made to the plan has no application, so long as
we do not require to borrow a sum greater than the whole surplus on our
Banking Account: since the extra million of charge occasioned by the
plan, will not absorb any part of our surplus either on the Exchequer or
on the Banking account, but will be provided for like the other expenses
of the year, by the ways and means voted by Parliament.

On the other hand, if we at any time require to borrow a larger amount
than our banking surplus, or in other words, than we can borrow from
ourselves, it does seem to me, as at present informed, that the plan is
pro tanto liable to the same objection as the old Sinking Fund. But this
contingency, if we keep out of wars (or even if we have wars, but only
short ones, at considerable intervals) will be altogether exceptional,
and will, I think, be greatly outweighed by the advantage of tying down
the nation to keeping up an extra revenue of a million for the express
purpose of paying off debt.

In time of war, Operation B4 might, and probably ought to be suspended.

I have received the invitation I expected from Lord Taunton’s
Commission2—and shall be much obliged by any references you can give me
to sources of information, or by any intimation of views of your own.
When your proposal came about visiting the Limehouse schools, we were in
Somersetshire; and at present it is extremely difficult for either of us
to find time for it. I think I should learn more about the schools from
any good account of them (if there be one) which you could refer me to,
than I should pick up from a flying visit.

I read both the articles you sent with great interest, especially the
conclusive and highly effective one from the Examiner.3

I should be very glad of a walk and talk with you as you propose, but it
is difficult to fix a time for it just now.

I thank you very much for your note. The report of my speech in the

have lost nothing by not being able to substitute my own report for it.
If I understand your note correctly it would not be open to you, if you
took a speech from myself, to give slips to the other papers. I am
afraid, if this is so, that it will generally prevent me from availing
myself of your obliging offer to receive such communications from me. It
is of much more importance to be well reported in the Times than
anywhere else, but one is so much more certain of being so, that if one
has to choose between sending one’s notes to the Times or to the other
papers one would rather do it to the others.2 I am

I am happy that, as I infer from your note of yesterday’s date, you are
not indisposed towards the extension of the electoral franchise to women
within the limits expressed in the petition.

The notice which I gave in the House yesterday2 goes as far as I think
it prudent to go, on this subject, in the present session. As there is
no chance that we can succeed in getting a clause for admitting women to
the suffrage introduced with the present Reform Bill, it seems to me and
to other friends of such a proposal desirable merely to open the subject
this year, without taking up the time of the House and increasing the
accusation of obstructiveness by forcing on a discussion which cannot
lead to a practical result. What we are now doing will lay the
foundation of a further movement when advisable, and will prepare for
that movement a much greater amount of support in the country than we
should have if we attempted it at present.

Dear Mr Plummer

It is most mortifying that we were beaten last night on the Gas Bill.2 I
thought when the Government took our side we should be successful, but
the influence of the Gas Companies, and the unwillingness of many
members to set aside the decision of the Select Committee, were too much
for us.

I found your letter at the House, but not your own petition, and I could
learn nothing about it. But it would have made no difference.

I obtained several votes for the right side. But some who would
otherwise have voted with us [said?] that the manufacturers are a still
worse nuisance, and that the ground now given to the Gas Company would
have been sure to be occupied by manufacturers.

The House will be very impatient of an attempt to renew the contest on a
subject of this sort after a decision, and will probably defeat us, in
consequence, by a greatly increased majority.2 Nevertheless, if Mr Tite3
and the others who led the opposition to the Bill the other night are
willing to oppose it again, I will join with them. Without their
concurrence it would be a mere waste of time attempting it. I think our
best hope now is the House of Lords, where the private pecuniary
interests are not so powerful. In that House the demonstration you
intend to make may have a considerable effect. I recommend a direct
application to Lord Derby4 for his support.

I am very sorry that I shall not be able to see you next Sunday, as I am

Dear Sir

Immediately on receiving your letter I wrote to Mr Gladstone, and I
inclose his answer,2 which I have only this morning received. I wrote
also to Mr Fortescue3 giving him notice that I should ask him a question
publicly in the House yesterday; but did not do so, since the private
explanation which he gave me in the House shewed me, as his memorandum
sent by Gladstone will shew to you, that all the mischief which could be
done by the Government without passing a Bill through Parliament has
been consummated.4 Edition: current; Page: [1178] The supplemental
charter received the Queen’s signature weeks ago. It empowers the Senate
to give degrees to all comers. In order to enable these graduates to
have any voice in the Government of the University, and to enable the
Govt to enlarge the Senate, a Bill is required which Fortescue was on
the point of introducing when the resignation took place.

You are better able than I am to judge whether any breach of faith has
been committed. Fortescue maintains that the expression of intention
given in their speeches was the notice promised, and a sufficient
warning. We, who were holding back on account of the Reform Bill,
certainly were led to expect a further notice: otherwise we should have
brought the matter before the House at once, which would have been very
disagreeable to the Govt. Whether treachery or misunderstanding, the
fact is most unfortunate both in its direct and its indirect
consequences. When you have made up your mind what is the best thing
that can now be done, please let me know. I suppose the next step will
be to put a question to the incoming Ministry.

The conclusion of your pamphlet which you sent to me in proof, is
excellent.5 It adds new and good arguments to the old ones. But I
suppose you will have to add a supplement to it now. In haste

My dear Sir

Many thanks for your note and its inclosure.2 I saw Mr Fortescue in the
House on Monday, and he gave me substantially the same explanations,
differing however in one point from what seems to be your impression,
for according to his statement the authority to the University to grant
degrees to all comers is a completed fact. The admission of the new
class of graduates to Convocation, and the increase of the numbers of
the Senate, require the Edition: current; Page: [1180] previous
authority of Parliament; but these are, in the eyes of opponents, only
secondary points, since the Government for the time being can, though
more gradually, infuse any element into the Senate by the process of
filling up vacancies. There has been an unfortunate misunderstanding in
this matter, on one or on both sides. Whose fault it was I am unable to
say; very probably ours. But the fact is that many Liberals who were
opposed to the changes fully believed that the speeches to which Mr
Fortescue refers were not the promised notice, and that in some shape
(such as a notice of the introduction of the intended Bill) they should
be otherwise warned before the last moment arrived; being anxious not to
stir until the last moment, on account of the Reform Bill. I am afraid
that the consciousness of having, or being thought to have, partly
themselves to blame, will not tend to soften their feelings, or
disincline them to blame others. I am

Dear Sir—

It would be very discreditable to any Englishman who watches the
progress of opinion, & is capable of understanding the vast importance
of speculative philosophy, to have remained ignorant of your
contributions to Edition: current; Page: [1181] it or of the influence
you have exercised over the mode of thought of a considerable proportion
of the few & scattered metaphysical students in this country. It would
always give me much pleasure to bear testimony to your knowledge both
special & general, your abilities, & your candid appreciation of
opponents, of which I have had a striking instance in my own case.2
Unfortunately, however, if I were to volunteer that testimony on the
occasion of the vacancy in University College,3 & if when given it were
of any value to you, it could only be so by being prejudicial to another
candidate4 who, though I have no reason to think his claims superior to
yours in any other respect, would certainly teach doctrines much nearer
than yours to those which I myself hold on the great philosophical
questions. Now though this in itself is far from being a paramount
consideration with me, the opportunities are so few & unfrequent of
obtaining for opinions similar to my own their fair share of influence
in the public teaching of this country that if I myself had a vote in
the disposal of the professorship, I shd think myself bound, in the
general interest of philosophical thought no less than of my own form of
it, to give the preference to a candidate (otherwise sufficiently
qualified) who would teach my own opinions, in one of the very few
chairs from which those opinions would not be a peremptory exclusion.
You are perfectly capable of entering into this feeling even if you do
not approve of it, & I can only add that I do not think I have ever in
any instance regretted so much my inability to support a similar
candidature.

Dear Sir—

I have read attentively your letter, and the printed correspondence
which you sent, and which contains many things having an important
Edition: current; Page: [1182] bearing on the question to which it
relates; but it seems to me to avoid a point which cannot be excluded
from consideration, viz., how far a nation is bound by the unauthorized
act of its representative when it has not disavowed that act at the
proper time.2 You say, “the way to recal the undue words of a
plenipotentiary would be to punish him for exceeding his powers.”3 But
whether we ought or ought not to have done this, we did not do it; on
the contrary, the few words of modified disapprobation which were
uttered by a few public men, only brought into stronger relief the
general assent, or at least acquiescence, which the Declaration of
Paris4 received from our all constituted authorities. Surely if there
ever was such a thing as a tacit recognition and confirmation of the act
of an ambassador, we have it in this case. I am far from giving this
consideration as conclusive; for, indeed, I hold the right of a nation
to bind itself and its posterity permanently, even by an express treaty,
to be much more limited than I believe it is generally deemed to be by
those who share your opinions. But there is surely a difficulty here
which I do not perceive that you have in any degree taken into account.

Dear Mr Plummer

I have read the essays which you sent,2 and I am glad that I was able
(though not without some inconvenience) to find time for doing so, as
they Edition: current; Page: [1189] were very interesting and
encouraging reading. All the seven essays deserve honourable mention,
and if they were printed together in a volume, it would be a really
valuable one, both for sound views and for arguments well worth
considering in support of what I think unsound ones. But the only one to
which, if I were the judge, I could conscientiously award a prize would
be the one numbered 160, with the motto, “Knowledge is Power.” This, I
think, is very decidedly the best, both in matter and style.

The one numbered 137, with the motto “Free Competition,” though by no
means equal to 160, shews a remarkable degree of mastery over some not
very obvious principles of political economy proving that the Sheffield
artisan by whom it professes to be written, has studied that subject
diligently and intelligently. If the writers were pupils in a school or
students in an University, this one would perhaps deserve the second
prize for his personal merits: but as an essay on the subject, and as a
composition generally, I do not think it [superior?] if even equal, to
several of the others. If the second prize is divisible, I should
suggest divid[ing] it among the six: if not, I cannot venture to
recommend any one of them as preferable to the rest. But if it is
necessary to select one, you can hardly go far wrong.

Dear Sir—

I am sincerely obliged to you for sending me your book on Democracy2
which I will read as soon as I can find time for any reading not
required by an immediate exigency.

The other subject of your letter, the possibility of an organization of
the middle class reformers,3 is very important but I am afraid very
difficult, as Edition: current; Page: [1190] it is hardly possible for
the advanced reformers to agree on a common creed & it would not be
desirable that each shd put in abeyance the special points of his own.
This observation applies to myself even more than to most reformers
since my particular scheme has probably very few adherents as a whole,
though almost every separate point of it has many. I can only say for
myself that I shd always be eager to cooperate with all other reformers
when I agree with them, & to go forward if necessary alone on those
convictions of my own with which others may not agree, or to which they
may not attach so much practical importance as I do.

I am very deeply impressed with the absolute necessity of maintaining
intact the convertibility of all bank notes; but whether payment in gold
at ten days sight might not be a sufficient protection against the evils
involved in inconvertibility, is a question fairly open to discussion,

however, inclined to rate highly the positive advantages of such a

published Edition: current; Page: [1192] with the signatures of some of
those members of the Committee whose names would have a favourable
influence on any part of the public.3 You are, in virtue of your
subscriptions, a member of the General Committee, and your name, as one
of those appended to the letter, would be of very great value, as it
would add, to a great intellectual and moral weight, that of a position
aloof from all the personal part of politics, and a character which no
one would think of calling intemperate or fanatical. Merely in the list
of subscribers your name is of great value, but if you would not object
to allowing the use of it for the other purpose, please communicate with
Mr. Chesson,4 the Secretary, 65 Fleet Street. He will send you the
letter and the list of those who have given, or hereafter give, their
names: the officers of the Committee of course, together with Bright,
Goldwin Smith, Samuel Morley (probably) and several other members of
parliament and liberal notabilities in the North of England.

Sir

You have probably thought me unfeeling, since your letter of July 17th
seemed to me to deserve an answer, in having so long delayed it. The
delay was not solely owing to the manner in which all my time was
engrossed during the latter part of the session, for if I could have
seen my way to any mode of helping your struggles, though only by
advice, I would not have omitted to do Edition: current; Page: [1194]
so. But I felt as if any time would be soon enough to say no, while by
waiting there might always be a faint chance of being able to say
something better. There is but little, however, that I can say, and
hardly anything that I can do. I have no power of obtaining government
appointments, and little or no influence with those who can give
literary employment. I am afraid, in the circumstances of the case, your
chance of obtaining employment as a teacher is small. Translating is one
of the most wretchedly paid of all kinds of literary work, and the
market is so overstocked with translators (very bad ones, but few
publishers know the difference) that it is almost impossible to get
employment even at that wretched pay. I see only two things of much
promise, in a literary capacity, open to those who are situated as you
are, and in neither of these would your opinions be much of an obstacle.
You might be able to form a connexion with some newspaper as subeditor,
correspondent, or writer, ultimately perhaps leading to editorship; or
you might be able to earn a subsistence by writing in periodicals. In
the former I have no power of helping you, unless you had already done
something which could be adduced as proof of your capabilities. In the
second it is barely possible that I might be of use to you; that is, if
you write an article and send it to me, then may be some review or
magazine which if I think well of it, would take it on my
recommendation, whereby the foundation might be laid for your becoming a
habitual contributor. After a good deal of thinking, I can find nothing
else to propose to you. Manuscripts can be sent here (Avignon, Vaucluse,
France) by book post, or if sent to my house (Blackheath Park, Kent)
they are sure to be forwarded, but possibly not in less than three or
four weeks.

You mention having been favourably recommended to Professor Key.2 From a
former slight acquaintance with him, I should not think him likely to be
prejudiced against you on account of your opinions; though what his
power of being of use to you might be, I do not know. I am

Sir—

The great occupation of my time in the latter part of the session has
prevented me from more promptly acknowledging your letter of April 14. I
Edition: current; Page: [1195] am glad to find that a student & thinker,
such as you evidently are, finds so much in common between me & himself.
The author of the article in the W. R. from which you quote (who is not,
as you suppose, Mr Lewes2) is quite right in saying that I have thrown
no light on the difficulty of reconciling the belief in a perfectly good
God with the actual constitution of Nature.3 It was not my business to
do so, but if I had given any opinion on the point it would have been
that there is no mode of reconciling them except the hypothesis that the
Creator is a Being of limited power. Either he is not all powerful or he
is not good, & what I said was, that unless he is good I will not call
him so nor worship him. The appearances however of contrivance in the
universe, whatever amount of weight we attach to them, seem to point
rather to a benevolent design limited by obstacles than to a malevolent
or tyrannical character in the designer & I therefore think that the
mind which cherishes devotion to a Principle of Good in the universe,
leans in the direction in which the evidence, though I cannot think it
conclusive, nevertheless points. I therefore do not discourage this
leaning, though I think it important that people shd know that the
foundation it rests on is an hypothesis, not an ascertained fact. This
is the principal limitation which I would apply to your position,4 that
we shd encourage ourselves to believe as to the unknowable what it is
best for mankind that we shd believe. I do not think it can ever be best
for mankind to believe what there is not evidence of, but I think that,
as mankind improve they will much more recognise two independent mental
provinces, the province of belief & the province of imaginative
conjecture, that they will become Edition: current; Page: [1196] capable
of keeping them distinct, & while they limit their belief to the
evidence, will think it allowable to let their imaginative anticipations
go forth, not carrying belief in their train, in the direction which
experience & the study of human nature shews to be the most improving to
the character & most exalting or consoling to the individual feelings.

I do not know enough of N. Zealand politics to enter on that subject
with you. I think most people in England are now of opinion that the
colony shd have perfect freedom to manage its own affairs, paying the
expenses of its own wars. There is some fear that you will not be just
to the aborigines, but a still stronger belief that if you are not we
cannot effectually protect them. I hope you are not wrong in saying that
there is no disposition to be unjust to them. But if so the New Zealand
colonists are I believe the only “Englishmen under new conditions” who
do not think any injustice or tyranny whatever, legitimate against what
they call inferior races, at least if those races do not implicitly
submit to their will. I will hope better things for New Zealand, but in
this as in the other & greater matter my belief will depend on the
evidence.

P.S. I have not forgotten Mr. Revans,5 to whom pray make my
remembrances.

Dear Sir—

Ever since the functions of a member of parliament have been added I may
say almost in spite of myself, to my other avocations, my time has been
so completely engrossed that I was obliged to postpone even the duty &
pleasure of thanking you for the second volume of your most interesting
& valuable Herculanean series.2 You will not be surprised that I have
not yet been able to give to the new volume more than a cursory
inspection. I am indeed reduced to wondering whether I shall ever be
able to resume those quiet studies which are so prodigiously better for
the mind itself than the tiresome labour of chipping off little bits of
one’s thoughts, of a size to be swallowed by a set of diminutive
practical politicians incapable of digesting them. One ought to be very
sure of being able to do something in politics Edition: current; Page:
[1197] that cannot be as well done by others, to justify one for the
sacrifice of time and energies that might be employed on higher work.
Time will show whether it was worth while to make this sacrifice for the
sake of anything I am capable of doing towards forming a really advanced
liberal party which, I have long been convinced, cannot be done except
in the House of Commons.

Meanwhile what a change in Germany!3 &, it may be said, in Europe: a
change of which it is hardly possible for any foreigner or perhaps for
any German, to divine the consequences. I am amazed at the confident
omniscience of English journalists, periodical writers, & members of
parliament, every one of whom thinks he perfectly sees all the
consequences that are to issue from what has happened, forgetful that
they themselves were mostly, when the war began, indignant denouncers of
Prussia & sympathizers with Austria while they have now quite passed
over to the other side. Rien ne réussit comme le succès. All the faults
of Austria are now seen & people have ceased to care for the flagrant
immorality of the contest on the Prussian side. They do not see, or they
do not care, that the struggle was between an expiring feudality & a
powerful Caesarism & that to wish success to the last even against the
first is to cast out devils by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.

I am very anxious to know what you think of all this. Few Germans are so
impartial both by position & by character as you are. What is now likely
to become of your country? It might be a greater country yet than it
ever has been, but there seems to me a want of practical good sense, &
comprehension of the situation in the counsels of the Court of Vienna
which give little ground of hope. Are the Hapsburgs capable of learning
from experience or of really fitting themselves into the circumstances
of a new age? The abolition of the Reichsrath4 which many European
liberals foolishly praised because it seemed a concession to Hungary,
has proved to be the most fatal step that could have been taken,
because, as might have been foreseen, it destroyed all faith in the
durability of a concession once made. It shewed that the Imperial family
did not deem itself bound by a Constitution once granted. The hopes I
had begun to form for Austria sunk to a very low ebb from that day.

I expect to be at Avignon till the end of this year & shall be very
happy if you have time & inclination to write to me.

Dear Sir,—

Your letter of Aug. 30th, did not reach me until too late to send a
letter which could be read at the meeting in favour of a Testimonial to
Mr. Beales. I think it quite right that reformers should make
compensation to Mr. Beales for the pecuniary loss to which he has been
subjected in consequence of the prominent part he has taken in urging
the claims of the working classes to representation in Parliament.2 I
see no force in the reasons assigned as a justification of this
treatment of Mr. Beales. Strong political convictions are not considered
a disqualification in much higher judicial offices than that of Revising
Barrister,3 nor are ever likely to be so considered except when the
opinions are on the side opposed to the ruling powers. To exclude from
the seat of justice all who are decided politicians would be to keep out
all the fittest men, for who in the present state of the world is
without strong political opinions of some sort, except because he is
wanting either in the mental cultivation or in the public spirit
requisite for taking due interest in the subject. And to say that the
opinions shall be an exclusion because they are known and avowed would
be still more absurd, since it is precisely when they are known to the
world that there is least danger of their exercising an improper bias on
the judgment. Besides, even if the reason were good against appointing
an active politician for the first time, it cannot hold against
retaining him who having been appointed has, by the acknowledgement of
even adversaries, proved his impartiality by his conduct.—I am, dear
sir,

Dear Sir,—

I thank you for your interesting and valuable letter of the 23rd ult.2
The considerations brought forward in the latter part of it are much to
the purpose, and will materially assist me in making up my mind on the
question to which you justly attach such high importance.

If, as you seem to have shown, Russia has, in the matter of Circassia,3
violated the provisions of the Declaration of Paris,4 it remains to be
seen whether France, the only other great naval Power which was a party
with us to the Declaration, is willing to join with us in getting rid of
it. You and your friends seem to anticipate no difficulty on this point;
and I certainly think that the Right of Search may, under many
circumstances, be valuable to France as well as to England. But I cannot
share your confidence in this matter, remembering how French
Governments, and especially the first Napoleon, have inveighed against
England for exercising this right, and have prided themselves on
vindicating against us what they called the liberty of the seas.

Mr. Disraeli’s statement,5 referred to in your postscript, seems to me,
as it does to you, to give ground for hope that this great question is
not closed.

I am, dear Sir, yours very truly,

Dear Mr Plummer

Many thanks for your note of Aug. 14 and the article from the Working
Man inclosed in it.2 The writing is that of one whose praise is worth
having, but he rather overstates the share I had in getting the
Industrial Societies Act passed.3 Mr Hughes, in his generosity, had
already given me too much of the credit which justly belonged to himself
and his friends. My evidence certainly helped them, but I was not
examined for “a whole week”: my examination only lasted a day,4 and the
transaction is altogether too highly coloured.

If you thought the parliamentary papers so bulky, what would you have
said if you had had the whole? A much greater bulk than what I sent to
you had unluckily been otherwise disposed of before you spoke to me on
the subject. But you will probably find some of them useful.

Will you kindly send me by post the biographical notice of me which you
wrote for Messrs Cassell?5 I have been asked by a Geneva editor for

sending to him as your paper, but I have no copy of it here.

TO JOHN MORLEY1

Sept. 26. 1866

Dear Sir—

I am much obliged to you for your article2 though I do not altogether
agree with it. I presented the petition,3 not because I concurred in its
sentiments, but because it came from people who were entitled to be
heard, & on the last day of the session they could not find any other
member whom they thought suitable. I approved of all Lord Dalhousie’s
annexations,4 except that of Kerouli which never took effect, having
been at once disallowed from home & indeed Lord D. himself gave it up
before he knew of its having been negatived. My principle was this.
Wherever there are really native states, with a nationality, &
historical traditions & feelings, which is emphatically the case (for
example) with the Rajpoot states, there I would on no account take
advantage of any failure of heirs to put an end to them. But all the
Mahomedan (Rampore excepted which descends from Fyzoola Khan the Rohilla
chief) & most of the Mahratta kingdoms are not of home growth, but
created by conquest not a century ago5 & the military chiefs & office
holders who carry on the government & form the ruling class are almost
as much foreigners to the mass of the people as we ourselves are. The
Scindia & Holkar families in Central India are foreign dynasties, & of
low caste too, Mahrattas who have usurped provinces from their native
dynasties of Jats, Goojars, Boondelas &c. The home of the Mahrattas is
in the South, & there is no really native Mahratta kingdom now standing
except Kolapore. In these modern states created by conquest I would make
the continuance of the dynasty by adoption not a right nor a general
rule, but a reward to be earned by good government & as such I would
grant it freely.

All this however was changed by Lord Canning’s promise,6 which I thought
Edition: current; Page: [1203] at the time, & still think most ill
advised. And even if right otherwise I think it ought to have excepted
states actually created by our gift, as Mysore was.7 In such cases we
are by right the sole interpreters of our own deed of gift. All
arguments grounded on vague phrases of that most plausible and
successful of political humbugs Lord Wellesley,8 count with me for
nothing. He would have taken the whole country outright had he dared,
but Parlt had then very recently made a solemn declaration against
territorial acquisitions in India & his object was to throw dust in the
eyes of Parlt & take the country as far as it could be done while
pretending not to do it. The only practical question with me is, does
Lord Canning’s promise to the native princes which waived our right of
escheat, fairly & reasonably include this particular case? Opinions
among experienced Indians are divided on this point & I have not yet
thoroughly examined the documents. I therefore have not made up my mind
though I much fear our faith is committed beyond recal[l].

In one thing I fully agree with you: that whenever we sanction an
adoption we ought to undertake the education of the young successor &
train him to public business under a judicious and experienced Resident.
This has been done in a good many instances & often with very
considerable success. Travancore which you mention is only one of a
number of cases in point (if we did educate the chief himself, which I
forget)9 & though the princes so trained usually degenerate more or less
in the lapse of years, they almost always remain much better than the
miserable creatures brought up in the zenana.10 One native chief within
a recent period before succeeding to his inheritance filled responsible
offices in our territories & he immediately commenced introducing the
best parts of our system into his own.

TO CHARLES GAVAN DUFFY1

Saint Véran, Avignon

Oct. 2. 1866

Dear Sir

I feel it a very high compliment that you should wish to know my opinion
Edition: current; Page: [1204] on a point of conscience, and still more
so that you should think that opinion likely to be of any assistance to
you in the guidance of your own political conduct.

The point mentioned in your letter is one which I have often and
carefully considered, for though my own course in public matters has
been one which did not often call on me to cooperate with anybody, I
have reflected much on the conditions of cooperation, among the other
requisites of practical public life. The conclusion which I have long
come to is one which seems rather obvious when one has got at it, but it
is so seldom acted on, that apparently most people find it difficult to
practise. It seems to me, in the first place, that a conscientious
person whose turn of mind and outward circumstances combine to make
practical political life his line of greatest usefulness, may, and often
ought to, be willing to put his opinion in abeyance on a political
question which he deems to be, in the circumstances of the time and
place, of secondary importance: which may be the case with any question
that does not, in one’s own judgment, involve any fundamental principle
of morality. But, in consenting to waive one’s opinion, it seems to me
an indispensable condition that he should not disguise it. He should say
to his constituents and to the world exactly what he really thinks about
the matter. Insincere professions are the one cardinal sin in a
representative government. If an Australian politician wishes to be in
the Assembly for the sake of questions which he thinks much more
important, for the time being, than that of protection, I should hold
him justified in saying to a constituency “I think protection altogether
a mistake, but since it is a sine qua non with you, and the opposite is
not a sine qua non with me, if you elect me I will not oppose it”. If he
conscientiously thought that the strong feeling of the public in its
favour gave them a right, or made it expedient, to have its practice
tried, I should not think him wrong in promising to support it; though
it is not a thing I should lightly, or willingly, do. He might even, for
adequate public reasons, consent to join a Protectionist ministry, but
only on condition that protection should be an open question—that he
should be at liberty to speak his mind publicly on the subject.—The
question of expediency in these matters, each must decide for himself.
The expediencies vary with all sorts of personal considerations. For
instance, if he has considerable popular influence, and is, in all other
respects than this, the favourite candidate, it will often be his most
virtuous course to insist on entire freedom of action, and make the
electors feel that they cannot have a representative of his quality
without acquiescing in his voting against some of their opinions. The
only absolute rule I would lay down, is not to consent to the smallest
hypocrisy. The rest is matter of practical Edition: current; Page:
[1205] judgment, on which all that can be said is, Weigh all the
considerations and act for the best.

It is a real pleasure to me to find you & myself in thorough & hearty
cooperation, even were it only on one subject. But the principle which
actuates both of us on that subject is progressively important, &
extends far beyond the particular case. You approve of my speech5
because you see that I am not on this occasion standing up for the
negroes, or for liberty, deeply as both are interested in the
subject—but for the first necessity of human society, law. One would
have thought that when this was the matter in question, all political
parties might be expected to be unanimous. But my eyes were first opened
to the moral condition of the English nation (I except in these matters
Edition: current; Page: [1206] the working classes) by the atrocities
perpetrated in the Indian Mutiny6 & the feelings which supported them at
home. Then came the sympathy with the lawless rebellion of the Southern
Americans in defence of an institution which is the sum of all
lawlessness, as Wesley said it was of all villainy7—& finally came this
Jamaica business the authors of which8 from the first day I knew of it I
determined that I would do all in my power to bring to justice if there
was not another man in Parlt to stand by me. You rightly judge that
there is no danger of my sacrificing such a purpose to any personal
advancement. I hope I shd not be so base even if I cared for personal
advancement, but as it happens, I do not.

When I last heard from the Cm they had raised £3200 though no appeal had
yet been made to the general public. It must be considerably more now; &
I have good hopes that we shall be near enough to getting the £10000 we
ask for, to bring the Jamaica question within the reach of those of us
who are most in earnest. The paper which I enclose contains only the
first subscriptions. I am glad that our manifesto has raised your
opinion of Goldwin Smith. I do not by any means agree in his practical
conclusions as to the colonies,9 though many of his premises are too
true. But he is a man of strong moral convictions which he is not afraid
to act upon & has a decided power of leading others—provided they do not
require to be conciliated first.

The Preston10 Cm did send me the placard which is excellent.

Dear Sir

I agree with you as to the importance of consulting the case of Governor
Wall,2 and I doubt not that our law advisers have made themselves well
Edition: current; Page: [1207] acquainted with it. I presume, and think
I remember, that it is in the State Trials. If so, that is by far the
most convenient place in which to study it.

The expensiveness of the attempt to get justice done in the Jamaica
matter, arises from the necessity of bringing a number of witnesses from
Jamaica to London, and maintaining them there until no longer required.
Our lawyers’ bills will doubtless be heavy, but will, for aught I know,
not exceed as many hundreds as we are obliged to ask for thousands. We
may possibly not require the whole £10000, but we thought, after
consideration, that it would not be safe to ask for less.

Dear Sir—

I could hardly have received any invitation of a public kind which I
should have had so much pleasure in complying with as that in your
letter of the 4th instant, which has only just reached me. I feel as
grateful as if I were myself an Irishman to whoever does any service to
the cause of Ireland, and there is no one who has better earned the
gratitude of Irishmen than Mr. Bright, were it only by his noble speech
on the Habeas Corpus Suspension Bill.2 I regard the honor which you are
paying him3 as an important step Edition: current; Page: [1208] towards
establishing that sympathetic co-operation between the English and the
Irish liberals, a beginning of which was happily made in the last
session, and which is not only essential to the early attainment of the
legislative improvements, required by both countries, but is in itself
of the most auspicious promise for the permanent well-being of the whole
empire. Ireland does not, however, stand in need of such a voice as mine
to assist her in doing honor to her eminent friend; and I am prevented
from availing myself of your invitation, not merely by distance, but by
the much more serious obstacle of pressing occupations, which require
the devotion of all my time up to the reassembling of Parliament.—I am

TO DAVID URQUHART1

S[t] V[éran]

Oct. 26. 1866

My dear Urquhart—

I thank you sincerely for your letter. The actual experience of one who
has had so much of it, & of so unusual a sort, is sure to be worth
having & worth meditating on.

Your letter makes me wish to give you an equally explicit statement of
my own way of thinking, so far as it is different from yours. And I
think I can trust myself sufficiently not to be afraid that my having
done so will raise any obstacle of amour propre in my own mind to
prevent me from changing any part of that way of thinking which can be
shown to be wrong. I feel as strongly as you the absence of control over
the executive in matters of foreign policy, & the absolute inutility &
nullity, as far as that is concerned of any change of Ministers. I shd
never dream of telling the working or any unrepresented classes that
they have no power unless they can get the suffrage, & I do not ascribe
the prodigious superiority of their moral sentiments on such matters as
Eyre, the Indian Mutiny,2 &c. over the classes socially above them, to
any intrinsic superiority of moral excellence. But I do not believe that
the bad feelings, or absence of good feelings, in the others, arises
from their having votes. I ascribe it to the sympathy of officials with
officials & of the classes from whom officials are selected with
officials of all sorts. I ascribe it also to the sympathy with authority
& power, generated in our higher & upper middle classes by the feeling
of being specially privileged to exercise them, & by living in a
constant dread of the encroachment of the class beneath which makes it
one of their strongest feelings that resistance to authority Edition:
current; Page: [1209] must be put down per fas et nefas.3 I do not
believe that feelings of these kinds would exist where there was no
privileged class, & where no one had more political influence of a
direct kind than his mere vote gave him. There is much in American
politics that is regrettable enough, but I do not observe that there is
a particle of the English upper class feeling that authority (meaning
the persons in authority) must be supported at all costs; & American
foreign policy is all above board & in broad daylight. So, I believe
would that of England be, if the working classes had votes. I am no
worshipper of those classes & they know it. I have written & published
harsh truths of them,4 which were brought up against me in meetings of
the working classes during my election & I never was so much applauded
by them as when I stood to what I had written & defended it. They are
not yet politically corrupted by power. I doubt not that they would be
corrupted like other classes by becoming the paramount power in the
country, though probably in a less degree because in a multitude the
general feelings of human nature are usually more powerful & class
feelings proportionately less so than in a small body. But I do not want
to make them predominant. I see the country under the leadership of a
higher & a middle class who, by long disuse of attempting or wishing to
do their duty as managers of the national affairs have become incapable
of doing it, & I am hopeless of any improvement but by letting in a
powerful influence from those who are the great sufferers by whatever
evil is done or is left uncorrected at home & who have no personal or
class interests or feelings concerned either in oppressing dependencies,
or in doing or conniving at wrong to foreign countries. I could write at
great length on all this, but it is not my object to defend my view of
existing English politics, my object is to enable you whom I respect, to
understand the source from which that view proceeds in my own mind. As
for those whom I do not respect, a category which includes the great
majority of public men & public writers, I should never take the trouble
to give any other explanation of myself to them, than that which I hope
my conduct will give.

I return, with thanks, the answer to Mrs Urquhart’s letter on Jamaica.

TO GEORGE GROTE1

Saint Véran, Avignon

Nov. 12. 1866

My dear Grote

Were I to be appointed to the Council of the University of London, the
chief advantage which I should anticipate would be that there would be
an Edition: current; Page: [1210] additional vote and voice to support
you on critical occasions. That I could, in case I survived you, be to
any effectual purpose your successor, is very improbable. Such an
influence as yours is, can only be acquired by many years of assiduous
devotion, such as you have given, to the business of the institution.2
Moreover, influence over such people as your colleagues in the Senate
can, by any one who has no claims to it but personal ones, only be
acquired by keeping constantly working at them, and wearing away by
perseverance the obstacles in their minds. He must not only accustom
them to look on him as a main prop, and the chief working mind of the
institution but must keep himself in frequent personal communication
with them, and bring social influences to bear on them. All these things
would be not only in the highest degree distasteful, but practically
impossible to me; and I do not see any reasonable prospect of doing as
much for our objects as would make it good economy in me to give the
time and trouble that would be necessary for effecting even such good as
might be practicable.

The help, however, which I might give to good objects as an auxiliary to
you, would be a strong inducement to me to accept your proposal; and
were I not in Parliament I would do so without hesitation. As it is,
however, my attending the Senate, even if limited to the two important
days which you mention, would have the effect of exactly depriving me of
the Easter vacation. It is hardly possible for any one who does not
share my life here, to estimate the greatness of the sacrifice that
being detained in England at that time would be to me, or to know in how
great a degree that break in the dreary six or seven months of London,
helps to keep up my health, spirits, and working power for what I have
to do there. I am willing, for any object which would make it my duty,
to add this sacrifice to the great one I have already made. But it is
not clear to me that it is my duty to do so for the amount of good which
I can see my way to effecting by means of it. As long as you are able to
continue your active exertions in the Senate, there is not much danger
that the ground already gained will be lost. And without you I see
little prospect that any influence I could ever have would supply your
place. It is, however, very desirable that there should be some one in
the Senate who would give you a more effective backing than you have at
present. But there are others besides me who could do this. Bain being
unattainable,3 have you ever thought of Herbert Spencer?4 He is as
anti-clergymanish as possible; he goes as far as the farthest of us in
explaining psychological phenomena by association, and the “experience
hypothesis”; he has a considerable and growing reputation, much zeal and
public spirit, and is not, I should think, more Edition: current; Page:
[1211] suspect on the subject of religion than I am. I think he would be
of great use in the Senate on the subjects on which you most need to be
supported, and a very valuable acquisition otherwise. I do not know
whether the duty would be agreeable to him, but from the little I know
of his tastes and habits, I should expect that, rather than the
contrary.

I am very glad that a majority of the Council of University College have
established the principle of confining the Moral Philosophy
professorship to laymen. I wish you had been able to get in Robertson,5
but you may still succeed in this, if the advertisements fail, as they
probably will, to attract any candidate of greater prestige.

When Martineau determined to become a candidate, he wrote to me, asking
for a testimonial. I wrote him a letter in reply,6 saying such
complimentary things as I could say with truth, but declining to give
him a testimonial, on the ground that I did not think it right to aid a
person of his philosophical opinions in getting appointed to one of the
few professorships in Europe that are open to a person of mine. Soon
after, I received a letter from Hutton,7 saying that Martineau, having
gone ahead, had charged him (Hutton) with sending in his testimonials
and asking leave to send in my letter to Martineau as one of them. To
which I answered that this would really be doing what I had declared
myself unable conscientiously to do, and I therefore refused; to his
considerable displeasure.

I hope the Aberdeen students will do themselves the honour of electing
you.8 I am in more need of a model for my own Rectorial Discourse than
capable of affording one to others, for though I have put into it a good
deal that may be useful, I think it is very likely to disappoint
expectation.

I am glad to see the announcement of a second edition of the Plato. I
see, every now and then, traces of its influence both in English and in
French writings.

Nov. 16. 1866

Dear Sir

I am greatly obliged to you for your letter of Oct. 22, and still more
so for Edition: current; Page: [1212] the printed one2 which I
subsequently received. It is a real pleasure to have you for an
antagonist, for you see the true gist of a question, do not trifle on
the mere surface of the subject, and your arguments are real arguments
addressing themselves to the real points in dispute and not to imaginary
ones. If I had more time I might perhaps go into the subject fully, and
answer you at as much length as you have answered me. But being obliged
to economize my working power, I will not go down to the foundations of
our difference, on which we are not likely to convince one another; if
we ever change it will rather be in consequence of the progress of our
own minds. I will merely touch on a few points which drew my attention
in reading your essay.

1. As to your argument, that our knowledge of our own power to move our
muscles cannot be derived from experience, because to obtain that
experience, we must already have voluntarily moved them.3 My way of
meeting that difficulty is this. I believe, with Hartley4 and Professor
Bain, that all voluntary motions were originally automatic, produced by
the stimulus of sensation, without what we call volition. For the
process by which an idea, or reminiscence in the mind, gains that power
over our muscles which was at first possessed only by sensations, I must
refer you to the authors I have named, especially Mr Bain “The Emotions
and the Will”, who is by far the fullest. If you have time to read him,
you will see that experience of the sequence between a thought or desire
and a motion may very well be (and, as we think, must be) complete
before the thought or desire grows into a will.

2. You say that there are only two things to which we attribute power:
viz. intelligence, and matter in motion.5 But there are many cases in
which we regard as a cause of motion, matter which is not in motion, or
(if there be no matter not in motion) which does not produce other
motion by its own motion, but independently of it. For instance, the sun
causes the motion of the earth: but, though the sun is now known to have
a proper motion, it is not by virtue of that motion that it attracts the
earth: if it were immoveable it would do so equally. Just so a magnet
makes iron move towards it by its mere proximity. True the magnet moves
round with the earth’s rotation and revolves with it about the sun, but
it would attract the iron just the same if those movements were
suspended. So, again, heat and light are causes, and active forces: the
modern opinion indeed is that heat and light are matter in Edition:
current; Page: [1213] motion, but they were just as much conceived and
known as active forces before that opinion grew up. I think this
consideration materially affects your theory, for the natural agencies
which have always been conceived as powers, agree in nothing but in
being the observed antecedents of motion or change.

Most of your arguments against my chapter on causation6 I have
anticipated in the chapter itself: but

3. You misunderstand my expression “as long as the present constitution
of things lasts.”7 You do not appear to see that the extinction of the
sun’s light would not be, in my sense, a change in the present
constitution of things. As long as all the properties of matter remain
the same, and are governed by the same laws, no modification which those
laws may produce in the concrete bodies surrounding us is a change in
the constitution of things. Consequently I do not admit that we believe
that “while the present constitution of things lasts night will
invariably precede day”.8 It will only do so if the sun continues to
give light, and if no other body of a similar nature comes into our
region, or we into its region, of the universe. Night, though an
invariable, is not an unconditional antecedent of day.

4. You say “As soon as we find that night can for a time exist without
producing day, we perceive that it cannot be the cause of day.”9 Then
sunrise is not the cause of day either; for the actual sunrise has taken
place for some time without producing day, viz. the time necessary for a
ray of light to travel over the intervening distance.

5. You say “if the whole aggregate antecedents are the cause of any
effect, then, as at each instant the whole antecedents are the same at
every point of space, the effects should be everywhere the same.”10
This, I think, you will see, is an oversight. The whole antecedents are
not the same at every point of space; for, the antecedent condition of
an effect is not the mere happening of an event somewhere, but its
happening in a certain degree of proximity to the scene of the effect;
and antecedents of this sort cannot be the same for any two points of
space.

I throw out these remarks merely as matter for your own mind to work on.
If they do nothing else, they will suggest answers from your point of
view, and will help to render your side of the argument more complete.

It is unlucky that your visit to England should have occurred while we
are away; for we shall not have returned by the time you mention, and I
fear you are not likely to visit this side of the Channel before you
recross the Atlantic: otherwise you would be warmly welcomed at our
little place. Does Edition: current; Page: [1214] the notice prefixed to
your printed letter include me? if so, I will return it through Messrs
Baring.

Dear Mr Hare

I have been in debt to you for two letters, I am ashamed to think how
long: but when one is as busy as I am, and has also so many letters to
write, the Edition: current; Page: [1215] friends one values most are
apt to be last served, if there is nothing in their letters requiring to
be answered immediately. You, also, have been working hard, and with
great efficiency, for and at the Social Science meeting.2 The ignorance
of the very A B C of the subject which was shewn by the speakers on the
other side, struck me even in the newspaper reports, and your letter
shews that this ignorance is accompanied by a false opinion of
knowledge. Lord Robert Montagu’s3 confounding your plans with the mode
of election which is of all others most different from it, and most
opposed to its principle, is very illustrative of the manner in which
English politicians, especially of his class, make themselves acquainted
with new ideas. They just snatch up some one feature—in this case, the
voting for many candidates instead of only two—and then fancy they are
masters of the whole thing. What I most want to say to you is this:
There will, in all probability, be a Tory Reform Bill, and whatever may
be its quality, no moving of amendments or raising of new points will in
the case of a Tory bill be regarded by Liberals as obstructiveness, or
as damaging the cause. Then will be the very time to bring forward and
get discussed, everything which we think ought to be put into a good
Reform Bill. I am anxious, therefore, to hear what, in your opinion,
would be the best way of bringing your plan before the House in the
approaching session. Perhaps the mode you mention, that of moving for a
Committee, would do best; for as Disraeli will be glad to curry a little
favour with the independent liberals, and not sorry to gain a little
time, we have more chance of getting our Committee, than perhaps we
should at a future time. If a Committee is granted, we will get Fawcett
and any other friends put on it, and I will devote myself as much as I
am able to working it, and extorting a real discussion of the plan from
the witnesses. If you think this the best way, should the motion be for
a Committee on your plan alone, or on representation of minorities
generally?

I suppose you saw in how excellent a way Lord Hobart returned to the
subject in his article on Bribery in the November McMillan.4 Mr
Schuyler5 says in a letter I have just received from him, “I have been
carefully reading Edition: current; Page: [1216] Mr Hare’s book, and
yours on Representative Government. For our country, I think Mr Hare’s
plan would have to be modified so far as to confine the choice of
members to districts of the country, like our present congressional
districts—perhaps to States—and this because of the great extent of our
country and the sparse population of most parts of it—” (He probably
means that the people do not know the notabilities of any State not
their own)—“Otherwise I can see no drawback to all the advantages it
undoubtedly would give. I shall do what I can to bring it into public
notice at home.”

On returning home the other day, I regretted to find that you and your
ladies,2 after taking the trouble to come, and staying some time for the
purpose of seeing me, had gone away disappointed: I should certainly
have made an attempt to find you before you left Avignon, if it had not
been already too late. The recollections left by my former intercourse
with your family are too pleasant for me not to have pleasure in
reviving them. I was sorry to hear that your visit to the South was for
the sake of Miss Caroline’s health—I hope only by way of precaution. The
winter climate of the South East of France is, I think, excellent for
chronic weakness or delicacy, but inferior to many other of the resorts
of invalids in case of actual disease, either pulmonary or bronchial:
and whenever there is any facility in taking cold, great care is
required. But Hyères, in the opinion of medical men, has in a less
degree than Nice the defects which are common to both. At all events it
will have, in your case, the advantage of being a very complete change;
for the type of its climate is the very opposite of that of Cornwall.

I am afraid we shall have left this place for England before you turn
your faces homeward; but either in England or here I should always be

you and Bain: and he has the consent of Germer Baillière, the publisher
of the series of Philosophie Contemporaine, to publish translations of
Bain and you by Dr Cazelles. I have formed a very favourable idea of his
capacity; his philosophical opinions are completely of the Experience

My dear Grote—

I am very happy that you think my objection to being proposed for the
Senate fair & reasonable. With regard to Spencer,2 Bain’s judgment will
be a great help to you in the matter. I have not seen very much of
Spencer, but what I have seen adds to the favourable side of the
impression his writings make on me. I am not inclined, from anything I
know, to consider him as on the whole disposed to magnify his
differences from others whose philosophical opinions are allied to his
own. He did so in the case of Comte, whom he knew very imperfectly. But
in his controversies with me3 it is rather I who have magnified the
differences, & he who has extenuated them. With regard to his
reputation, no doubt it has not yet reached its height, but it is
constantly growing. His is the rising philosophical name at the present
& will probably stand very high ten years hence—& it is rather with a
view to the future than to the present that additional thought is wanted
in the Senate.

I have read several of the attacks on the Council about Martineau4 with
much disgust at their extreme unfairness. There was, however, in the
Morning Star of Nov 28th a leading article on the subject,5 as good & as
much to the point as if it had been written by one of ourselves. In case
you have not seen it, I inclose the article. Though the writer has
evidently seen my letter to Martineau, I have no idea who he is. It may
be the editor, Mr. Justin McCarthy,6 who, judging from two articles
which he wrote [long?] ago in Edition: current; Page: [1220] the W.R.,
on Voltaire & on Buckle,7 is a man of very considerable ability & very
good opinions.

TO THOMAS HUGHES1

Dear Mr Hughes

The idea of exhibiting in detail the practical need of reform, and
answering the objections to it, in a volume of short essays,2 seems to
me a very good one. If as well executed throughout, as from the persons
engaged in it, some parts of it are sure to be, there is reason to hope
that it will not only help Parliamentary Reform in the coming session,
but will also hoist the flag of a future party of practical reformers,
in anticipation of the time for following Parliamentary Reform to its
consequences. It is impossible, however, that I should write anything
for the collection, as I have work in hand that will require all my time
up to the opening of Parliament.

With regard to the two departments for which I am asked to recommend
writers, No 4 of the A series will, I think require to be divided. For
Poor Law and Sanitary Reform, Mr Chadwick is the right person, if he can
be prevailed on: if not, he is the person most competent to recommend
some one else. For Municipal Reform, I should propose my constituent Mr
James Beal, who has paid great attention to the subject, and understands
it well: or, failing him, perhaps Mr Horton.3 9 C, “the House of Commons
and Taxation”, I think I would omit altogether. There is no longer much
to complain of in the conduct of the House of Commons, under the
guidance of Mr Gladstone, on this subject; and any one who took it up
with that idea, would probably do so on the wrong principles of the
Liverpool Financial Association.4 The worst things the House of Commons
is now chargeable with on the subject of taxation, are the non-extension
of the Probate Duty to real property, and the levying of the Succession
Duty, in case of settled property, on the life interest only: and these
points, I think, would come in better, à propos of something else.

Edition: current; Page: [1222]
No 1 of the B series, which was destined for me, would be an excellent
subject for Mr Goldwin Smith.

I think you would find Professor Cliffe Leslie a valuable coadjutor. He
is an excellent popular expositor of scientific thought, one of our best
political economists, and has thought much and well on several of the
proposed subjects, the land laws being one.

If I think of anything else worth writing, I will write again. I am

TO GEORGE GROTE1

Dec. 25. 1866

My dear Grote

I am much obliged to you for giving me the history of the struggle which
ended in the appointment of Robertson.2 “Those who exerted themselves to
get the professorship suppressed because their candidate was rejected,
have certainly given their measure by it, and a very wretched one it
is.”3 As Helen said when she read your letter, it is like the Judgment
of Solomon: we see on which side the real case for the institution and
for the subject is; for there is probably not one of us who would not
have voted for Martineau rather than lose the professorship altogether.
I am truly happy that you were sufficiently well supported to avert
either result.

I do not know whether the younger men are, as you think, inferior to
those who were formed between 1820 and 1832; it is hardly possible to
judge until they shew what they are when they reach the same age, for
the Edition: current; Page: [1223] more various culture of more recent
times causes people to ripen slowly. We must not forget either, that
your experience and mine of the older set includes the very best of
them—those who were formed under the Benthamic influence. There was, in
general, Kimmerean darkness then, beyond the region to which that
influence, directly or indirectly, extended.

I have got through fully three fourths of the revision of the Hamilton
for the new edition.4 I have corrected some minor matters; but the wish
you expressed, on Hamilton’s account, that some one might be able to
clear him from a part of the inconsistencies and other errors laid to
his charge, has not been realized to the extent that might reasonably
have been expected. Mansel,5 in particular, is perpetually crying out
that I have misunderstood Hamilton, but the points on which he makes out
even a plausible case of misunderstanding are extremely few and small.
Some of the new matter I have inserted will, I think, add to the
intrinsic value of the book, independently of repelling objections.

Among the books I have had occasion to read in connexion with the
subject is one lately published by Chapman and Hall, called “Inquisitio
Philosophica, an Examination of the Principles of Kant and Hamilton by
M.P.W. Bolton,”6 which is on our side, and attacks Mansel, and which I
think you would like very much. The writer is a scholar, well read in
the history of philosophy as well as in philosophy itself, is
particularly good at stating correctly and clearly both sides of a case,
and though he does not always profess to decide between them, shews
plainly enough that he holds with the inductive school, both in their
philosophy and in its consequences. I have mentioned his book to Bain.

In referring to the article in the Westminster, on Hamilton and me,7 am
I at liberty to speak of it, either directly or by a circumlocution, as
yours, or, as attributed to you? Unless you would rather I did not, I
should like to be allowed to do so, not only on account of the value of
your expressed approval of the book, but for the sake of the opportunity
of expressing my sense of that value.

I hope Aristotle8 is profiting by the termination of your troublesome
and anxious contest.

With our kind regards to Mrs Grote, who I hope is now quite recovered, I
am

Dear Chadwick—

Let me begin by requesting you to thank Miss Chadwick very heartily from
me for the trouble she took in writing to me as your representative. I
am extremely sorry for the cause which rendered her aid necessary; most
of all on your own account. The loss of what you would have written &
done during the interval is also much to be regretted, but on the whole
you, like myself, have had less than the average share of interruption
in your work from ill health.

I have, as you know, always agreed with you as to the importance of
introducing military drill into schools, though I should be a little
frightened at it if I thought it would do what in your present paper2
you say it sometimes does—make the majority of the boys wish to be
soldiers. There can be no doubt also that by this means the purposes of
an efficient reserve would be attained without either the expense, the
loss of productive power, or any other of the evil consequences of
increased armaments. But for that very reason it will not be listened to
by any of the Continental governments except possibly Italy. Those
governments do not want a real defensive force; they want an aggressive
force; they want to have the very largest body of adult soldiers ready
for service anywhere, whom they can afford to pay, & your arguments will
be of no avail except to the French & Prussian liberals to use, against
their governments. In that respect they may be very useful & I think
copies might usefully be sent to the Temps newspaper, to Jules Favre,3
Jules Simon, Carnot,4 Garnier Pagès,5 Lanjuinais,6 &c. and to Twesten,7
Schultze-Delitsch,8 Jacobi,9 & any other of the best liberals in the
French & Prussian Edition: current; Page: [1225] chambers. It was a good
idea sending a proof to M. Wolowski10 for the Institute & if you were to
give him a copy for M. Rouher11 there might be a chance of Rouher’s
reading it. The idea of employing soldiers in civil work is not new in
France, & it has been much discussed. You will find many minds prepared
for it. I do not at present see any service that I can be of in the
matter, at least by writing. I do not understand military subjects & can
carry no authority upon them. But I will most willingly move for your
paper & may take that opportunity of speaking my mind on the matter as a
question of education.12 Hoping for a better account of you before long
I am

Dear Sir

I am most desirous to find out what can be done to relieve you and the
Review from your present difficulties.2 Besides the importance of the
Review to the friends of progress, you have a very strong personal claim
on them, not only by what you are likely to do, but by what you have
already done. Any help in my own power to give, would go but a little
way: and unfortunately my personal connexion does not lie among monied
people. Most of my radical allies in the House of Commons who are men of
wealth, and who are chiefly Yorkshire and Lancashire manufacturers,3
care for little except practical matters and politics: the most
characteristic feature of the Westminster Review, its freedom of
speculation in religion and philosophy, would rather be distasteful than
a recommendation to most of them; while many who like this, do not like
its radicalism. I do not know whether there is any other M.P. except Mr
Stansfeld,4 whom there would be any use in taking into our councils. Him
you probably know. The only other persons I can think of to consult with
are Mr Grote and Mr Herbert Spencer. With both of these, however, it is
likely that you are already in communication. If you give me permission
to consult with them and with Mr Stansfeld, I will write to these three,
and will inclose to Mr Grote your letter to me, with a request to pass
it on. In the meanwhile, if I think of anything else, I will write to
you again; and I hope you will mention to me anything that occurs to
yourself.

I have received your second letter,2 and require a little more time to
consider what is best to be done. In the meantime there are two
questions I should like to ask. The first is—Is it in your opinion
undesirable, or would it be disagreeable to you, that I should consult
on the subject with Mr Herbert Spencer? or do you merely think that it
would be of no use? The other point is this. There is one essential
element of the question about which I should certainly be asked by every
person to whom I might speak on the subject; the present pecuniary
position of the Review. What is now its sale? and do the proceeds
suffice to pay the actual expenses, or is there a fresh deficit every
quarter, to be added to the debt against which you and the Review are
now struggling? If you will do me the favour to answer these questions,
I will then write to you again without delay. I am

Dear Sir

As you kindly leave the question of consulting with Mr Spencer2 to my
judgment, I will do so or not as it may seem to me, from future
circumstances, advisable. Mr Octavius Smith3 I am not acquainted with,
and have no direct access to. Indeed I am acquainted with very few
monied people, well affected to the principles of the Review. Do you
know Mr P.A. Taylor? and what should you think about my consulting with
him?

In any case, I think it advisable not to attempt doing anything by
letter but to wait for personal communication. And I am not hopeful
about doing much, depending, as I must, on only one or two people for
not only subscribing themselves, but getting subscriptions from others.
What occurs to me in the meantime is this. One of your ideas was to
raise £600 on a mortgage of the Review for five years, on condition that
repayment should commence then, at £100 a year. If you are inclined to
try this as an immediate answer, I would propose to take the mortgage
myself, without interest. This would enable you to get rid of the
pressing demands; to save something (I suppose) in interest; and we
should have two years before us in which to look out for the remaining
£500, besides the chances of an increase of your practice in that time.

That is glorious news about diabetes.4 If you can even occasionally cure
such an intractable and fatal disease by your remedy, you will surely
end by having a great practice. That you will leave a great name behind
you as an alleviator of suffering and an improver of the medical art, is
now, I think, almost certain.

idée. Quant à la question de la population, je suis heureux de voir que

Le règlement du nombre d’enfants dans les familles me paraît, comme à

économique, et même, dans les circonstances actuelles de l’humanité bien
davantage; car d’un côté le grand accroissement de la richesse, et de
l’autre côté l’habitude croissante de l’émigration ont fort atténué
l’importance de la question de la population économiquement parlant.

Dear Sir

I have had the honour of receiving your communication of Oct. 21 on the
subject of your plan for promoting a large emigration from Great Britain
to New South Wales. I have, as you are aware, strongly advocated a
national scheme of self-supporting emigration,2 based on the fund
derived from the sale of waste lands in the Australian colonies: but, in
the plan I proposed, no expense, beyond a temporary advance, would have
been incurred by the mother country. In the present altered state of the
labour market in Great Britain and Ireland, occasioned by the great
increase of spontaneous emigration, our politicians have grown more
afraid of under than of over population; and I am convinced that no
scheme for aiding emigration at the public expense would now be listened
to. Whatever is done to promote emigration to Australia, must now be
done from the Australian side: and your plan might very properly engage
the consideration of the Colonial Governments. Of the particular
machinery which you propose, I cannot be so capable of judging, as those
on your side of the water.

Jan. 29. 1867

My dear Sir

On arriving from abroad I found the communication which you have done me
the great honour of addressing to me on the subject of the intended
Royal Commission of Inquiry into the questions connected with Trades
Unions.2 The importance of such an inquiry cannot be overrated; and that
you should wish to include me in the number of those to whom it is to be
entrusted, would be of itself a proof of your desire that it should be
so conducted as to do complete justice to the artisans’ side of the
question, equally with that of the employers.

Were the inquiry by a Committee of the House of Commons (though a much
less efficient mode of investigation) or were its operations likely to
be terminated within the Parliamentary season, I should feel bound in
duty to accept the honourable office of taking a share in them. It is,
however, next to certain that the proceedings of the Commission not only
cannot be concluded before the end of the session, but will be carried
on with much greater activity Edition: current; Page: [1232] during the
recess. And it is extremely important to me to preserve the smaller half
of the year for occupations, other than political, which I do not think
it right to abandon; while I have a strong conviction that to pass some
months of every year in the South is essential to the preservation of my
health.

It seems to me, also, that the greater part (at least in discussions) of
the investigations of the Commission will be of a quasi-judicial
character, for which I am not aware that I have any special aptitude. If
I could be of use, it would rather be in drawing conclusions from the
evidence when taken, than in helping to take it. There are others whose
presence in the Commission would be, as much as mine, a guarantee to the
working classes that justice would be done to their opinions and
objects: for instance, Mr Fawcett,3 who has made the subject one of his
chief studies, who knows the workmen’s side of the question (we all know
the other side) and who is much trusted by them.

You are very fortunate in the President you have obtained for the
Commission.4 It is sure to do much good; and though I am not able to
accept a place in it, no one will more heartily rejoice if its inquiries
lead to more correct opinions or improved legislation on so vital a
subject, and no one will join more cordially in applauding and thanking
the present Government for every step they take in that direction. I am

Dear Sir,

Your question respecting the obligation of veracity on the utilitarian
view of ethics2 seems, if I understand it rightly, to proceed on a
misapprehension of the utilitarian standard. The test of right on the
happiness principle is not the pleasure of doing the act which is
declared to be right, but the pleasurable or painful consequences to
mankind which would follow if such acts were done; & these, in the case
you put, could not be enunciated in any general rule, because they
depend on varying circumstances. There are cases in which martyrdom is a
useless self sacrifice, & a sacrifice of other means of doing real good.
There are other cases in which the importance of it to the good of
mankind is so great as to make it a positive duty, like the act of a
soldier who gives his life in the performance of what is assigned to
him. There are cases again where without being so necessary as to be, on
the utilitarian ground, an absolute duty, it is yet so useful as to
constitute an act of virtue, which then ought to receive the praise &
honours of heroism. The duty of truth as a positive duty is also to be
considered on the ground of whether more good or harm would follow to
mankind in general if it were generally disregarded and not merely
whether good or harm would follow in a particular case.

I agree entirely with the general principles & spirit of your letter

& those parts of the Old which are either poetical or properly
historical, Edition: current; Page: [1236] should be taught as history
in places of education;2 & so far my only difference with you would be
that nearly all teachers, both churchmen & dissenters, being as yet far
short of the enlightened views which you entertain on the subject, would
at present be sure to teach & inculcate all that is contained in those
books not as matter of history but of positive religious belief. There
are, however other parts of the Old Testament viz. those which
scientific knowledge or historical criticism have shewn not to be, in
any proper sense of the word, historical, the book of Genesis for
example; & I do not think it right to teach these in schools even as
history, unless it were avowedly as merely what the Hebrews believed
respecting their own origin & the early history of the world.

I am very happy that you think so favourably of the St Andrews address,

altogether agree with you that the side favourable to it is too strong;2
for I think there is a growing reaction to the opposite extreme,
producing a danger on that side which being the side most in harmony
with modern tendencies has the best chance of being ultimately the
stronger.

I am most happy to hear that there is a chance of reviving the scheme of
the Reader.3 I agree with you as to the desirableness of taking time to

Feb. 14, 1867

Dear Sir—

I have read your article2 with very great interest. You are the clearest
thinker I have met for a long time who has written on your side of these
great questions. And I quite admit that your theory of divine
premovement is not on the face of it inadmissible. Your illustration of
the mice inside the piano is excellent.3 The uniform sequences which the
mice might discover between the sounds & the phenomena inside would not
negative the player without. But you only put back the collision between
the two theories for a certain distance. It comes at last. At whatever
point in the upward series the unforseeable will of the divine musician
comes in, there the uniformity of physical sequence fails: the chain has
been traced to its beginning; a physical phenomenon has taken place
without any antecedent physical conditions. Now what would be asserted
on the other side of the question is, that the facts always admit of, &
render highly probable, the supposition that there Edition: current;
Page: [1241] were such antecedent physical conditions, & that there has
been no ultimate beginning to that series of facts, short of whatever
beginning there was to the whole history of the universe.

We do not pretend that we can disprove divine interference in events, &
direct guidance of them. All our evidence is only negative. We say that
so far as known to mankind everything takes place as it would do if
there were no such direct guidance. We think that every event is
abstractedly capable of being predicted, because mankind are in each
case as near to being able actually to predict what happens as could be
expected, regard being had to the degree of accessibility of the data, &
the complexity of the conditions of the problem.

I cannot perceive in your article any errors in physics. But I am not a
safe authority on matters of physical science. Astronomers now think
that they can predict much more than eclipses & the return of
comets—their predictions reach even to the dissipation of the sun’s heat
& the heaping up of the solar system in one dead mass of congelation.
But I hold all this to be at present nothing more than scientific
conjecture. All that is required by your argument is that the
possibility of absolute & categorical prediction should be, as yet,
confined to cosmic phenomena. This, I believe, all men of science admit,
& I indorse everything on that subject which is said by Mansel in your
note.4 Scientific prediction in other physical sciences is not absolute,
but conditional. We know certainly that oxygen & hydrogen brought
together in a particular way will produce water, but we cannot predict
with certainty that oxygen & hydrogen will come together in that way
unless brought together by human agency. The human power of prediction
at present extends only to effects which depend on a very small number
of causes. Astronomical phenomena do depend on a very small number of
causes, & consequently can be predicted. Most other physical phenomena
can be predicted with the same certainty provided we are able to limit
the causes in question to a very small number. This power of prediction
you have not, I think, allowed for in your Essay. Yet it surely is all
important. For if the effect of any single cause, or of any pair or
triad of causes, can be calculated, the joint effect of a myriad of such
causes is abstractedly capable of calculation. That we are unable
practically to calculate it is no more than might be expected, at least
in the present state of our knowledge, however calculable it may in
itself be.

With regard to free will, you have not said much that affects my
argument. I am not aware of having ever said that foreknowledge is
inconsistent with free will. That knotty metaphysical question I have
avoided entering into, & in my Logic I have even built upon the
admissions of the free will philosophers that our freedom be real though
God foreknows our actions.5 You simplify the main question very much by
your luminous distinction between Edition: current; Page: [1242] the
spontaneous impulse of the will, which you regard as strictly dependent
on preexisting mental dispositions & external solicitations, & what the
man may himself do to oppose or alter that spontaneous impulse. The
distinction has important practical consequences but I see no
philosophical bearing that it has on free will; for it seems to me that
the same degree of knowledge of a person’s character which will enable
us to judge with tolerable assurance what his spontaneous impulse will
be, will also enable us to judge with about an equal degree of assurance
whether he will make any effort, & (in a general way) how much effort he
is likely to make, to control that impulse. Our foresight in this matter
cannot be certain, because we never can be really in possession of
sufficient data. But it is not more uncertain than the insufficiency &
uncertainty of the data suffice to account for.

Thanking you very much for giving me the opportunity of reading your
very able & interesting speculation I am &c.

that it was in practice rather than in theory that his work and his
influence were most beneficial. I look upon the example he set of
friendly intercourse between master and scholars, and of effort on the
part of the teacher to arouse moral ambition in his pupils, as of great
practical value; and if generally followed, sure to produce (as I think
it has already produced) a considerable reform in the whole method and
results of school teaching.

.

Dear Sir—

I am sorry to say that the proceedings at the meeting of Delegates
reported in the Star2 of Feb. 28, a meeting promoted by the Reform
League3 & at which members of its Council were the chief speakers, make
it necessary for me to withdraw the paper which I had expressed my
willingness to sign: because I can no longer say with sincerity that an
agitation conducted in the manner proposed at that meeting would be
beneficial to the cause of Reform.

The speeches delivered at the meeting were characterized by two things:
a determined rejection beforehand of all compromise on the Reform
question, even if proposed by the public men in whose sincerity & zeal
as reformers you have repeatedly expressed the fullest confidence, & a
readiness to proceed at once to a trial of physical force if any
opposition is made either to your demands or to the particular mode,
even though illegal, which you may select for the expression of them.

It is best that I shd express my opinion plainly & unreservedly on both
these points. My conviction is that any Reform bill capable of being
passed at present & for some time to come must be more or less of a
compromise. I have hitherto thought that the leading minds among the
working classes recognized this, & though frankly declaring that nothing
less than the whole of what they think required by justice will finally
satisfy them, were aware that such ultimate success can only in this
country be obtained by a succession of steps, and that a large portion
of the middle and some portion of the higher classes may be carried with
them in the first step, & perhaps in every Edition: current; Page:
[1248] successive step, but would certainly resist a passage all at once
from the present distribution of political power to one exactly the
reverse, the effects of which they feel quite unable to foresee. All
this the speakers at the meeting on Thursday either forgot or entirely
disregarded.

But even if I thought them right on this point I shd think them utterly
& fatally wrong in the course they adopted of directly instigating the
mass of reformers to seek the attainment of their object by physical
violence. One of the leading speakers proclaimed superiority of physical
force as constituting right, & as justifying the people in “riding down”
the ministers of the law; & the speaker who followed him emphatically
expressed concurrence in his treatment. I do not impute to the meeting
the monstrous doctrine of these two speakers. But unless misreported,
the general tone was that of a direct appeal to revolutionary
expedients. Now it is my deep conviction that there are only two things
which justify an attempt at revolution. One is personal oppression &
tyranny & consequent personal suffering of such intensity that to put an
immediate stop to them is worth almost any amount of present evil &
future danger. The other is when either the system of government does
not permit the redress of grievances to be sought by peaceable & legal
means, or when those means have been perseveringly exerted to the utmost
for a long series of years, & their inefficacy has been demonstrated by
experiment. No one will say that any of these justifications for
revolution exist in the present case. Yet unless the language used was
mere bravado, the speakers appear to have meant to say that the time has
already come for revolution.

I do not wish to exaggerate the importance of these things; I believe
them to be the result of feelings of irritation, for which there has
been ample provocation and abundant excuse. But however natural
irritation it may be, things done or said under its influence are very
likely to be repented of afterwards. This, however, is for you to judge
of. I do not claim the smallest right of offering advice to you or to
the League, but you have asked me to express, in a written document,
approbation of the general character & effects of your agitation, & as
it is impossible for me to do this when it has assumed a character of
which I decidedly disapprove, I have thought it best to explain candidly
the reasons why I must now decline to comply with your request.

Dear Sir

Excuse the long delay in answering your letter of the 22nd ulto. I have
really had no time, during the interval, to write anything which would
bear delay.

Edition: current; Page: [1249]
I quite agree with you that in proposing Mr Hare’s scheme, a suggestion
should be made for its tentative introduction on a limited scale. Mr
Hare has himself made several such suggestions, and particularly that of
giving every qualified elector the option of being registered either
locally as at present, or as a member of a national constituency. The
new mode of voting would be applied only to those who chose the latter,
and who in the commencement at least, would probably be a select and not
very numerous body. This suggestion seems to me preferable to that of
trying the experiment on a distinct category of electors composed of the
professional and specially educated classes; on account of the serious
objections that exist to any mode of officially recognising the special
representation of classes. But if such a category of electors were going
to be created, I certainly think that the application of Mr Hare’s plan
to it might usefully be proposed.

I do not at all agree with you that small minorities in the nation have
not a claim to the means of getting themselves specially represented in
Parliament. I regard the maturing of opinions by public discussion as
one of the most important functions of the House of Commons. And as to
the danger of loss of time by the discussion of mere absurdities, there
is a sort of voluntary police in the H. of Commons which is only too
effectual in setting bounds to any discussion that is felt to be a bore.
There are few who would be willing to occupy the position in the House
of Mr Whalley,2 though his follies, I am afraid, are far from being
those of a very small fraction of the public. I do not believe that any
opinion, entertained by very few, would be able to obtain more than an
occasional and rare hearing in the H. of C. unless it had for its organ
some member generally respected & looked up to. I am

TO RICHARD RUSSELL1

March 6th, 1867

Dear Sir—

I do not see that the fact that it may become expedient at some future
time to admit women to the House of Representatives can be any bar to
admitting their claim at present to be electors. Any objections to the
meeting of persons of both sexes for the purpose of legislation are such
as naturally tend to diminish with a higher state of civilization. In
some countries the sexes are still separated at church; in the East the
influence of sex is so strong that even family life is rendered
impossible by it, and brothers and sisters, fathers and daughters, are
separated, and men and women can only associate together in the single
relation of husband and wife. But we have proved by experience that
exactly in proportion as men and women associate publicly together in a
variety of relations not founded on sex, their doing so becomes safe and
beneficial, and raises the tone of public morality. I am disposed to
think that no legislation is needed to prevent women from becoming
members of parlt for that before any woman is likely to be chosen by a
sufficient number of electors, public opinion will ensure sufficient
propriety of sentiment in the House of Commons to make her presence
there perfectly harmless.

Edition: current; Page: [1252]
As to the objection that men & women might on some occasions differ
collectively, and that the women might have their own way, it has much
less force than the similar objection to the working classes, because
men and women are much more likely to be evenly balanced in number than
the poor & the rich. I cannot see how arranging that men shall always
have their own way in everything can in justice be the proper way to
prevent women from occasionally having theirs. There is a more even
balance between men and women than between any other two classes and
therefore the attainment of justice through equal representation may be
more easily trusted to the reason & right feeling of the best among each
acting as a check to violence or party feeling on either side.

I should object to the plan of a subordinate house of representatives
for women just as I should object to any such plan for working men, and
just as I should object to placing the House of Commons in any such
subordination to the House of Lords. I dislike all merely class
representation, and I still more disapprove of all class subordination.
Moreover one of the useful functions of a H. of Representatives is
discussion, and the representation of women’s point of view whether
through male or female representatives is part of what would be gained
by admitting women to the suffrage. And it is not merely in the H. of C.
but also even in the tone of electioneering and popular politics that
the admission of new elements to the national life is of importance. New
topics get discussed and old ones from new points of view. Different
classes of electors are aroused to interest, and to influence one
another. Shutting their representatives up separately, even if with
equal powers, would be to weaken the educational influence of political
contests, and at the same time to intensify their bitterness.

M. Plummer est un homme encore plus remarquable. Il a été longtemps
simple ouvrier dans une petite ville de province. Il a commencé à écrire
sous la stimulation d’une vive indignation contre certains procédés d’un
Trades Union. De là, il a été toujours en progrès; il est maintenant
écrivain et journaliste, et ses écrits, sur toutes les questions qui
intéressent particulièrement la classes ouvrière, sont remarquables par
leur bon sens, par leur philanthropie éclairée, et même par la pureté de
leur style. Malgré les désavantages, non seulement de sa position mais
de sa personne, car il est boiteux et un peu sourd, il a une influence
considérable parmi les classes ouvrières, surtout en matière sociale et
économique, car, quoique radical, il s’occupe moins de politique que des
questions d’éducation et de progrès moral et intellectuel. Je suis sûr
que vous ne le connaîtrez pas sans éprouver pour lui un vif intérêt; et

Dear Chadwick

You will have seen that you were mistaken about what Mr Hardy did on
Thursday,2 and that the [substantive?] discussion in Committee commenced
last night.3 In the course of it, I had opportunities of enunciating
several of the true principles of administration (though I am very
imperfectly reported—the Edition: current; Page: [1255] Star report4 is
the best) and I shall bring out others of them on Monday5 when the
Committee is to be resumed and when it will get to the position and mode
of appointment of the medical officers. None of the reports give (what I
said very emphatically) that, for the executive duties, the only persons
to be relied on are the paid officers, and that the use of boards is to
look after those officers.

Mr Hardy tells me that Miss Nightingale’s paper6 is already before the
House annexed to the Cubical Space Report.

Thanks for your article, which I will return shortly.

Dear Sir

You are evidently a real student and I wish that all who read my books
would scrutinize them with the same strictness.

In quoting the passage from De Quincey2 I did not mean to make myself
answerable for all it contains, but only for so much of it as is
recognized in my own introductory sentences. I thought it in the main
right and well fitted to carry the reader into the very heart of the
subject, and when there to set him looking about and thinking for
himself, which opinion is confirmed by the effect it has had upon you. I
do not think that Mr De Quincey has in this passage given a correct
expression to the whole of the truth, and on the particular point which
is the subject of your letter my opinion agrees with that which, if I
rightly understand your letter, you have arrived at.

Yours faithfully

put it on the notice paper (to the great satisfaction, among others, of
Dr Stallard) to be moved on bringing up the Report.2 I shewed it first
to Mr Hardy, who said that the plan was ‘what we shall certainly come
to.’

What I said is better reported this time than last,3 though briefly.

The Bill is now through Committee, and one of Mr Hardy’s own amendments4
has given the Poor Law Board, to a great extent, the power you want, of
classifying without district restrictions.

able to suggest some other improvements in the draft.3 As I gave my

anything which your letter contains though I should sometimes express

I am glad to find that considering women essentially inferior to men and
therefore requiring that the constitution shall recognise the domination
of men over women, you are yet willing to grant to women a right to
advise men how to govern them; and that you think they ought to be
permitted larger liberty and privileges than they at present enjoy.

Edition: current; Page: [1258]
Your point of view is quite reasonable and complete in itself; I have
only one fault to find with it—I think it a mistaken one. I see no
reason for believing women to be inferior to men, and I do not believe
them to be so. You will of course see that it would be impossible for me
to find time to enter with you into a discussion on the fundamental
equality of the two sexes, it will be sufficient to indicate to you that
this is the true point on which we are at issue.

2nd April 1867

Dear Sir—

I am glad to find that you agree with me in thinking that there is no
sufficient evidence that women are morally or intellectually, or
essentially inferior to men. But in that case I am afraid I no longer
think your theory reasonable so far as it goes, and complete in itself.

I do not think it indisputable that the physically strongest must
necessarily be dominant over the physically weaker in civilized society,
since I look upon it as the fundamental purpose of civilization to
redress as much as possible all such natural inequalities, and I think
the degree to which they have been redressed as one of the best tests of
civilization.

Nor is superior physical strength invariably even at present the ground
of political supremacy, for I suppose there can be little doubt that
negroes are physically stronger than white men. But superiority whether
of physical strength or of intelligence, having once given any
sub-division of humanity an advantage over another it is always
difficult for the dominant class to Edition: current; Page: [1262] see
that their own particular superiority does not justly entitle them to
limit the freedom or check the development of those who chance to be
inferior to themselves in some respects. To see this it is necessary to
admit in some form or other the law of justice or of the general good as
the final test, but I do not at all despair of mankind as a whole
becoming capable of recognising it as such, as I understand you yourself
to do. I must beg you to excuse the brevity with which I am obliged to
write.

very creditable to you, that I advise you by all means to continue
thinking, reading, & studying; but I hesitate to advise you to publish,
because I think you will very probably acquire additional thoughts which
will modify some of those that you have stated with so much vigour, & on
many points with so great a foundation of truth. You will also, by
persevering self culture, acquire constantly greater power of doing

in inspiring that ceaseless activity in working for what they deemed
right, by which in all ages the great victories have been won for truth

From the turn which events are taking, there is now, I think, no

In thinking of the various possibilities of your return to Parliament,
it has occurred to me that one of the most promising might be, to offer
yourself for one of the two Parliamentary boroughs into which the Tower
Hamlets are to be divided.3 One advantage of this is that you would not
displace any existing member, whose friends would oppose you: another
is, that there are no preponderant or commanding local interests in a
metropolitan borough.

Another chance would be to try against Doulton4 for Lambeth. Almost any
presentable candidate standing as a supporter of Reform and of
Gladstone, could probably succeed against Doulton if he were the first
in the field.

It is feared that the University of London will return Fowler,5 the late
Tory candidate for the City, who is an alumnus of University College,
and takes an active part in its affairs and in those of the University.

Dear Sir—

I write now to ask a favour of you, which however I am certain before I

formed a plan for publishing a series of papers on the representation of
women, which she would like to consist of the following:

-   

    1. Mrs Mill’s paper from the Westr on the Enfranchisement of women2
-   

    2. Mr Spencer’s chapter on the rights of women from “Social
    Statics”3
-   

    3. Passages on the same subject from Mr Bailey’s “Rationale of
    Repr”4 with Mr Mill’s speech in the H. of C.5 & passages from “Repr.
    Govt”.6
-   

    4. Miss Becker’s article on Female Suffrage from Contemp Rev.7
-   

    5. Mrs Bodichon’s papers read at the Soc. Science Assn.8
-   

    6. Miss Taylor’s article on the Claim of Englishwomen to the
    franchise.9

If the consent of these different writers can be obtained, she proposes
to get them reprinted in a uniform series & published by Messrs Trubner
at a very low price; probably 1 d. each.10

Can you consent to the publication in this form of your chapter, without
which my daughter says the series would want solidity.

May 26. 1867

Dear Mr Cairnes

We were very happy to hear of the improvement in your bodily state which
you mention in your letter of the 20th.2 I should hope, most earnestly,
that you will not omit any measures whatever that promise a chance of
improvement, nor allow yourself to remain in any circumstances in which
you do not think you find some improvement going on. I know by
experience how much may be done by energetic measures, and while I have
great faith in the power of intelligent medical men over disease, I
would never place faith in any individual one, under whose treatment I
was not progressing. I think one ought to use one’s own intelligence in
seeking for remedies, and to use the advice of the best doctors as a
guide and help to one’s own judgment. It pained me to hear that you were
not making progress at Pau. It is possible that the climate of that
place is not sufficiently bracing for you, and that the keen stimulating
air of Nice, so dangerous in some cases, and so magically beneficial in
others, might be of use in yours. Dr Gurney of Nice is a man of whose
professional abilities I have a very high opinion, and whose long
residence at Nice makes him a very good judge of the cases [in] which
stimulating air may safely be tried, while I know that he sends away
patients who he thinks have been injudiciously sent there by other
medical men. If you should at any time think of trying the effect of dry
bracing air in warm climates, such as that of Nice, Egypt, Malta, &c.
you might perhaps like to hear Dr Gurney’s opinion of it in reference to
your own case, and I am certain that if you wrote to him mentioning that
I begged you to do so, you would get a very intelligent and
disinterested opinion. I am so desirous that you would leave no means
untried that I hope you will excuse me for mentioning this.

As the volume of Dissertations3 has not been forwarded, and as you have
not read the paper on Plato,4 I will send you a separate copy of it by
post. I had already desired that the new and enlarged edition of the
book on Hamilton5 should be sent immediately on publication to the care
of Major Cairnes6 at Pau.

You will have seen the debate on the representation of women.7 The
Edition: current; Page: [1272] minority of 73 (which would have been
near 100 if the division had not taken place unexpectedly at a bad time
of the evening) is most encouraging, and has put its members and many
other supporters in great spirits. The greatest triumph of all is
getting [John] Bright’s vote: ten days before, he was decidedly against
us.

We are not yet safe from the gross blunder as well as crime of shedding
the blood of Fenian prisoners. The Government had decided, by a
majority, to hang Burke.8 About 50 M.P.’s, of which I was one, went as
soon as possible to intercede with Lord Derby,9 and at this time of
writing I do not yet know what is the result. If they have not given in
we shall attack them furiously in the House tomorrow.

As to Lord Naas’ bill,10 it does so very little that nobody seems to
wish it to pass, except, probably, himself: I think, however, that it
had better pass, because it contains the principle of giving
compensation for improvements beneficial to the landlord, though made
without his consent. But there are symptoms of the Government’s giving
way on this point, and if they do, the Bill will be a mere authority to
lend public money, even if ostensibly to tenants, yet really to
landlords, for improvements by which landlords alone will benefit,
except so far as everybody is benefitted by any agricultural
improvement.

I hope you do not depend on the Times or Galignani for all your news.
Probably you see the Daily News. Not only that, but the Star, and even
the Telegraph, are much fairer, have often better reports and contain
much that the Times does not choose to give.

With our kind regards to Mrs Cairnes, whose health we were happy to hear
had improved.

Dear Sir—

I do not anticipate that women would be made less valuable in the house
by having their minds directed to the great concerns of mankind: but
quite the contrary, wherever men’s minds are employed as much as they
ought to be on those great concerns.

Neither do I think that the adaptation of the work of each person to his
Edition: current; Page: [1274] or her special endowments or position is
a thing to be preappointed by society. I believe that perfect freedom
will adjust these things far better than any general regulation can.

Perhaps I do not differ so much from you as you suppose, as to what is
likely to be permanently the main occupation of a very great majority of
women. But I do not think that the majority should give laws to the
individual action of the minority.

I do not undervalue “what teachers of religion can effect”. I rate it
most highly, but what they do effect I rate very low. An example of what
they might do has been given lately by the Independent Church at
Totnes,2 in severely rebuking those of its members who have been
implicated in bribery, and only not expelling them from its communion
because they expressed the deepest penitence, and determination never to
offend in that manner again. This gave me the rare satisfaction of
finding an existing Church, or branch of a Church, who are actually
Christians. I am, Dear Sir, with many thanks for your kind and courteous
expressions towards myself,

yours very truly

In answer to your letter of May 27 I beg to say that the passage you
refer to in my speech at St James’s Hall was correctly reported.2 And I
do not know how anyone could express himself otherwise who believes, as
all Englishmen do, that insurrections & revolutions are sometimes
justifiable. I will only mention, as cases about which there is scarcely
any dispute in this country, the resistance to Charles I; our own
Revolution of 1688; the Polish insurrections; & the Italian revolutions
by Garibaldi & his friends.

I did not mean that all insurrections, if successful, stand exculpated;
the rebellion of the American slaveholders would have been equally
guilty & even more detestable if it had succeeded. What I was arguing
for was that even those revolutionists who deserve our sympathy, ought
yet for the general good, to be subject to legal punishment if they
fail.

Dear Sir,—

The superiority of the qualification, by direct taxation, over that by
local rating,2 has been made still more obvious by the recent
discussions, than it was before; and I have met with many, in Parliament
and out of it, who think so, including one member of the present
Government. But the almost certainty we now have of really passing a
large Parliamentary Reform, depends on our letting the Government have
their way on the point which they have chosen to proclaim as the
principle of their bill, and the only thing they cannot give up. In the
very first session of the Reformed Parliament, the question will
probably be revived, as the parishes will not like to lose the
convenience of collecting the rates through the owner; and the desire to
reintroduce the compound householder, without refusing him a vote, will
probably lead to a movement in favour of some other condition, such as
yours would be. To discuss it, on this Reform Bill, would be to
complicate the subject with a long discussion about taxation and
finance, which neither Parliament nor the country would, at the present
moment, support.—I am, dear Sir, yours very sincerely,

Dear Madam

It is impossible for me to bring forward the Cumulative Vote as a
substitute for Personal Representation, which in my opinion attains the
same specific object far more completely, and has many additional
recommendations, Edition: current; Page: [1278] both moral and
political, which the Cumulative Vote has not.2 The Cumulative Vote,
however, under the necessary condition of three members to a
constituency, is to be proposed by Mr Hughes,3 and I shall vote for it
as the second best proposal: whether I shall say anything on that
occasion will depend on circumstances, but much of what I have said for
Mr Hare’s plan will be argument for the Cumulative Vote.

I am sorry that the Representation of Women has not the benefit of your
support. No doubt, there are plenty of women, as there are of men, who
are at present very insufficiently qualified for the exercise of
political judgment; but their exclusion from the suffrage does more than
anything else to perpetuate that incapacity, by stamping it with the
approbation of Society. The removal of that stamp would make women feel
entitled to exercise their minds on politics, and they would very soon
know quite as much on the subject as men know; which they never will do
while society and the law warn them off the ground.

Dear Sir:

Being one who takes as deep and as continuous an interest in the
political, moral, and social progress of the United States as if he were
himself an American citizen, I hope I shall not be intrusive if I
express to you as the executive organ of the Impartial Suffrage
Association,2 the deep joy I felt on learning that both branches of the
Legislature of Kansas had, by large majorities, proposed for the
approval of your citizens an amendment to your constitution, abolishing
the unjust political privileges of sex at one and the same stroke with
the kindred privilege of colour. We are accustomed to see Kansas
foremost in the struggle for the equal claims of all Edition: current;
Page: [1279] human beings to freedom and citizenship. I shall never
forget with what profound interest I and others who felt with me watched
every incident of the preliminary civil war3 in which your noble State,
then only a Territory, preceded the great nation of which it is a part,
in shedding its blood to arrest the extension of slavery.

Kansas was the herald and protagonist of the memorable contest, which at
the cost of so many heroic lives, has admitted the African race to the
blessings of freedom and education, and she is now taking the same
advanced position in the peaceful but equally important contest which,
by relieving half the human race from artificial disabilities belonging
to the ideas of a past age, will give a new impulse and improved
character to the career of social and moral progress now opening for
mankind. If your citizens, next November, give effect to the enlightened
views of your Legislature, history will remember that one of the
youngest States in the civilized world has been the first to adopt a
measure of liberation destined to extend all over the earth, and to be
looked back to (as is my fixed conviction) as one of the most fertile in
beneficial consequences of all the improvements yet effected in human
affairs. I am, sir, with the warmest wishes for the prosperity of
Kansas,

the Spectator you kindly sent came safe. We2 have, as you see, splendid

my neuralgia, which came on as usual after the first half hour’s walking
and remained much the same as in our bad days in the [Lebern?]3 (bad in
that respect but glorious in all others). And, what is worse, I have it
already this morning before starting, from the mere exertion of
dressing. I am obliged therefore to take a fly today to carry us out a
certain distance and begin our walk from thence though if I had been in
proper condition we would have done it all on foot. We have determined
to remain here the whole time, as none of the other places we wish to go
to are too distant for excursions from hence. So any letters or
newspapers posted on Monday will reach me if sent here. It is
unnecessary to post any on Tuesday. With love to pussy, your ever

The country is not pretty, though it has pretty bits here and there; but
we have thriven well botanically, having found two rare plants yesterday
and two today, being four out of the five we hoped for. We hope to find
the fifth tomorrow. I have been thinking very often of you and puss, and
hoping that the PMG [Pall Mall Gazette] would put in your letter.2 As
for work I have been too tired each evening to do any except reading

Dear Mr Cairnes

Many thanks for your kind and interesting letter of June 10. Since then
we have twice had news of you through Thornton. I should think Barèges a
very desirable place to try, as regards specific influence on your
complaint, though all the Pyrenean climates are moist and relaxing. With
regard to Montreux, I have been there, and remember its situation, which
seemed sheltered, but I should have thought that no place in the Alps
could have a climate mild enough in winter for a weak chest, or dry
enough at any season for a rheumatic patient. However you will doubtless
make all necessary enquiries and only act on the advice of good medical
men well acquainted with the place.

You will have seen that Fawcett did not fail to bring on his motion for
opening Trinity College.2 You will also have seen the amendment which
Monsell moved;3 and I am very desirous to know what you think of it. My
present impression is that though constituting a change for the worse,
it is Edition: current; Page: [1284] less bad than the plan of the late
Government because it is compatible with making the governing body of
the proposed University impartial, and unconnected with the Colleges;
excluding ultramontane Catholics, or at all events greatly diminishing
their influence: and less bad also than the plan to which the present
Government seem inclined, that of giving a charter to the Catholic
University, because that would lead to a bidding for students by
lowering the standard required for degrees in all secular subjects. But
I wait to hear your opinion before forming any decided one of my own.

I never expected any better reception in Parliament or the press for
Personal Representation than it has met with. Considerable good has
notwithstanding been done, and the plan is becoming known, and obtaining
serious consideration from many who had not previously attended to it.
The Women’s question has been a most decided and important success, and
it is truly astonishing how the right opinion is spreading both among
women and men since the debate. We are now forming a Society in London
for the Representation of Women,4 and hope to get others formed in
Edinburgh, Dublin and elsewhere (there is already a most efficient one
in Manchester, which obtained the majority of the 13500 signatures to
this year’s petitions). The proposed Society will probably be composed
of an executive committee of ladies, a General Committee of both sexes
subscribing one guinea a year, which will be the ultimate governing
body, and ordinary members who will only subscribe a small sum per
annum, will receive the reports and circulars, but have no part of the
management. The chief members of the Executive Committee will be Mrs P.
A. Taylor,5 Miss Cobbe, Mrs Stansfeld6 and Mrs Fawcett. My daughter and
I will be on the General Committee. Will you and Mrs Cairnes give us
leave to put your names upon it? and can you give any help for the
formation of a Society in Dublin?

It would have given you great pleasure had you been at the Garrison
breakfast,7 and heard, especially Bright, and Garrison himself. I wished
for you, too, at the splendid Reform meetings at St James’s Hall,8 if
only to see Edition: current; Page: [1285] and hear the admirable
feelings of the people respecting Ireland. A propos, at the last meeting
Mrs Law9 addressed them in favour of the political equality of women,
and was not only loudly applauded but when she asked all who were in
favour of it to hold up their hands, nearly the whole of the multitude
who were present did so. Is not that worth having worked for? I am

his bread studies “the application of science and art to the production
of pottery”: and he asks me to recommend to him the book or books which
would be most useful to him. I need hardly say that I am very ill
qualified to do this from my own knowledge, and I therefore venture to
ask of you what answer I had better give to his question. I only know
him (Wood is his name) from several long letters I have received from

recommending books to him, it is not necessary to adapt oneself to an
inferior capacity; but it is, no doubt, desirable to keep practical
application constantly though not exclusively in view.

July 3rd 1867

Dear Sir

I should certainly endeavour to find time for assisting any movement
among my Constituents which I think of public importance and with which
I am able to sympathise.

But any movement for attempting to interfere with the full liberty of
the Sovereign in the disposal of her private life so long as the example
given is not mischievous, I should look upon with the very strongest
disapproval.

I can conceive nothing more likely to be immoral & mischievous in its
whole influence on society than any attempt to exact luxurious
expenditure as a duty from those placed in high station; and I believe I
am not expecting too much from the morality, the public spirit, & the
patriotism of those tradesmen who make an immediate profit from such
expenditure, in believing that they will be content to live by
ministering to the store of luxury & pleasure which is a strong &
universal principle in human nature, without seeking to stimulate
artificially what if not kept within close bounds, is the ruin of public
& private happiness & morality.

I do not hesitate to say that from the point of view of political
economy, the notion entertained by many that such artificial stimulus is
good for trade, is founded in error. All which it really does is to
transfer gains from some dealers & tradesmen to others; while by
encouraging expenditure which is not reproductive, it tends to diminish
instead of increasing the employment for labour & the general wealth of
the country.

And even if my convictions on these points were different from what they
are, I should still think that the private affections—I will go further
& say the personal tastes—of a Constitutional Sovereign are entitled to
the respectful acquiescence of the people and ought never to be
interfered with until at Edition: current; Page: [1288] least they lead
to conduct which would excite moral disapprobation, or entail legal
penalties on private individuals.

Mon cher d’Eichthal

Je suis honteux d’avoir si longtemps tardé à vous remercier de vos
aimables attentions à M. Théobald2 et à M. Plummer3 et à répondre à
votre lettre du 19 avril. Vous savez, du reste, ce que c’est que la vie
parlementaire dès qu’on la prend au sérieux, et vous concevez jusqu’à
quel point elle nuit à la correspondance. Aujourd’hui même je suis forcé
d’être très bref. D’abord j’applaudis à votre Association pour
l’encouragement des études Grecques en France,4 et puisque vous croyez
que l’adhésion d’un étranger peut servir à quelque chose, je vous prie
de proposer mon nom, et je vous ferai parvenir par la première occasion
la cotisation annuelle. Il n’y a guère lieu, quant à présent, à quelque
chose de semblable en Angleterre, où les études grecques sont
suffisamment encouragées. Il est vrai que les méthodes d’enseignement
ont besoin d’une réforme radicale, mais les savants et les professeurs
les plus éclairés y travaillent déjà, et je crois que nous sommes à cet
égard en voie de progrès, un peu lent à la vérité, comme d’ordinaire
dans ce pays-ci.

Maintenant laissez-moi vous témoigner le plaisir véritable que m’a donné
la noble protestation que vous avez publiée contre la recrudescence de
l’esprit guerrier et des haines nationales dont la France naguère
semblait menacée.5 Vous avez été presque le premier à vous prononcer en
ce moment critique, et ce fut pour moi une grande joie que de voir avec
quelle énergie la voix d’une grande partie de la nation a répondu à cet

July 4 [1867]

Dear Sir:

In acknowledging your letter of Feb. 18, I am ashamed to see how long
that acknowledgment has been delayed. Your letter arrived in the thick
of the parliamentary conflict, and I have ever since been so fully and
engrossingly occupied, that I have had no time to write any letters but
such as are indispensable, nor had I any leisure to write anything which
would have been worth offering to be laid before the anniversary meeting
of the Equal Rights Association.2 Since that time, however, many things
have happened, and among others the debate in the House of Commons on
the motion for giving the suffrage to woman. The unexpectedly large
minority which the proposal obtained, and the thought and discussion
which it excited in quarters where the subject had never been thought of
before, have given an immense impulse to the question. Numbers both of
men and women in all ranks have since given in their adhesion to the
movement; and agreement with it is rapidly becoming a badge of advanced
liberalism.

I need not say with what pleasure I learned, both from your letter and
from many other sources, the great progress which the question is making
in the United States, where the disabilities of women are now the only
remaining national violation of the principles of your immortal
Declaration of Independence; nor need I describe the feelings caused in
me by the assurance of yourself and others that the essay published in
the Westminster Review in 18513 has been in America, as it has been
here, one of the most powerful agents in placing the question in the
position it now occupies.

I am, dear sir, yours sincerely and respectfully,

J. S. Mill

Dear Sir

As I have not myself sufficient knowledge of recent works on geometry to
be able to direct you to the books best adapted for your purpose, I have
consulted my friend Mr De Morgan,2 the late Professor of Mathematics at
University College London, who is not only one of our best
mathematicians but a distinguished thinker on other important subjects.
He was much interested by what I told him of you, and suggests that you
should write directly to himself, stating in some detail both what you
know and what you want. In doing so, you should specify what you know,
whether much or little, of arithmetic, geometry, algebra, and physical
science, as well as anything else you may like to tell him of your
general knowledge and mental habits. His address is Augustus De Morgan
Esq, 91 Adelaide Road, London, N. W.

I am very glad that you have so just and clear an appreciation of the
true character and merits of Mr Hare’s system, and that you are making
it known among your friends and fellow workmen. It is in that way that
truth gets on. I am obliged to be brief, but I shall always be happy to
hear from you at any length. Continue to direct here, as, when I am
abroad, letters are forwarded to me at least once a week. Do not send
stamped envelopes. I am Dear Sir

Dear Mr Fawcett

I entirely agree with you about the unsatisfactoriness of Lord Stanley’s
answer, and I meant to give notice of a further question the next time I
am at the House, which will be on Friday.2

Edition: current; Page: [1291]
I am, on the whole, rather against carrying the subject of the Sultan’s
ball any farther.3 It is by no means the strongest case of charging
India with expenses that if incurred at all, should be borne by England;
and many who might support us in other cases would probably consider the
reason given by Northcote, that the civility is in return for assistance
given to telegraphic communication with India, a sufficient
justification for charging India with the expense. But what weighs with
me more than this, is that, very possibly, Northcote did not tell us
all. The real fact is that the Sultan has done his part in the
telegraphic business very badly; he will not allow English telegraph
clerks, and his Turkish ones perform the duty abominably. Perhaps,
therefore, under pretence of thanking him for what he has done, the real
object is to induce him to do better, and there may be a plan for
coaxing him into concessions by putting him in good humour, which any
further opposition might unwittingly obstruct. What you have already
done has been very useful; the disavowals which it has elicited have
wiped off part of the stain on our character, and it would perhaps be as
well to let the matter rest for the present. I am

I am much obliged to you for your most interesting letter which I have

Irish education question—which question I am sorry to say looks very
ill. I hope soon to write to you about it at length. But my present
object is different. I have heard that you have written to the
authorities at University College expressing a fear that you may be
obliged to resign the Professorship.2 Now even a chance of your being
able to resume its duties is so valuable that I entreat you not to
resign in the present season at least. I am aware that Waley3 declines
going on for another year, but our friend Leslie is ready and desirous
to take the duty as your locum tenens, and if you are willing to go on

substitute, there Edition: current; Page: [1294] can, I think, be no

those who would take it.

for removing the disabilities of women cannot be better stated than in
your words, and in those of Lady Houghton cited in your note. Would it
be too much to ask the benefit of her name along with yours on the
General Committee? I am not uneasy about the future fate of
representation of minorities, for the working men do not share the
indifference of the middle class to superior cultivation, and are much
more willing than the middle class to give full and thorough-going
effect to a principle. Hughes stated at the meeting on Wednesday3 that
the question was debated at the Working Men’s College, and after several
discussions was at last decided in favour of representation of
minorities. The only plan which fully and fairly carries out the
democratic principle is Mr. Hare’s, and that is now rapidly making way
among thinking people.

Dear Sir—

I thank you for your two little books,2 & regret that until within the
last few days I have been prevented from reading them by mere want of
time & by no means through indifference to their contents.

You have not misunderstood my meaning in the St Andrews address though
the very concise manner in which I was obliged to express everything in
that paper may probably have given you a partially incorrect impression
of my opinions on education generally. There is much in your view of the
subject with which I heartily agree. Your strictures on the system of
French schools by which the boys are never for an instant out of the
sight or free from the direct control of a master I entirely agree in &
I have long thought that while French schoolboys, on the average, are
better taught & learn more than English boys, the freer system of
English schools has much to do with the superiority of England over
France in the love & practice of personal & political freedom. I also
agree to the full in your & Dr Hook’s3 principle that real education
depends on “the contact of human living soul with human living soul.”
But I am entirely sceptical as to the possibility of accomplishing this
in any very considerable degree in a numerous school. Even the family if
it consisted of 200 or 300 boys could not possibly accomplish it. A wise
& zealous master may no doubt acquire a certain amount of beneficial
moral influence over the boys & may come into really close contact with
the minds & characters of a few among them. In the former of these
points if not in both, St Mark’s School appears to have been signally
successful; & the principles on which it appears to be conducted are
well calculated to attain whatever Edition: current; Page: [1305] such
success is attainable. But while I applaud both your theory & your
practice I have the less hope of finding my opinion radically altered by
them because you seem to me to regard Eton as a favourable specimen of
what a school can do in the way of moral & religious training; an
opinion from which all that I know of the kind of article turned out
annually from Eton into the higher walks of life in this country leads
me strongly to dissent.

I thank you for the cuttings you kindly sent. Mr Greeley’s notion of two

enough, though there are points in the article which make one feel
indulgently towards the writer. I have met with an Englishman who had a
similar notion.3 I suppose one might search long before finding a third.

I hardly think (to carry on your metaphor) that it is worth while to
fire at such a long range on a position so little formidable. Perhaps to
write against the proposal as a serious thing might be the way to make
it one. Moreover I have too much on my hands at present. I shall be glad
to hear if you find that the suggestion does any mischief. But I am more
inclined to think that whatever leads people to turn over a great

My dear Sir

I give this letter to my friend Lord Amberley, not so much for his sake,
for he would easily obtain abundant introductions to you, as to make use
of the privilege of writing to you which was kindly conferred on me by
the letter I had the pleasure of receiving from you last year.2 Few
Englishmen, especially few Englishmen in political life, are more worthy
of the privilege of knowing you than Lord Amberley3 who, while he is one
of the very best of our rising politicians, is even more interested in
the intellectual movement of mankind than in the political. He is likely
to keep always in the front rank of his cotemporaries, and I fully share
the general hope of his friends that he will be as useful to the coming
generation as his father has been to that which is past.

Edition: current; Page: [1307]
I wish I could share with him the pleasure and benefit of hearing from
your own lips your commentary on the present state and prospects of
mankind. To me it seems that our two countries, on the whole the two
most advanced countries of the world, have just successfully emerged
from a crisis essentially similar, though by much the gravest and most
trying in the United States; which has shaken up and dislocated old
prejudices, set the stagnant waters flowing, and the most certain
consequence of which is that all the fundamental problems of politics
and society, so long smothered by general indolence and apathy, will
surge up and demand better solutions than they have ever yet obtained.
To those who, like me, regard stagnation as the greatest of our dangers,
and the primary source of almost all social evils, this is a very
hopeful and promising state of things; but it will make a most serious
demand upon the energies of all cultivated minds, to obtain for thoughts
which are not obvious at first sight, their just share of influence
among the crowd of notions plausible but false or only half true. I am

with, as I shall require to study them. The addresses you intend writing

I thank you very much for your two letters, and have had great pleasure

women’s suffrage question I agree with so completely, that it is quite
unnecessary for me to say anything more on the subject.

With regard to the projected Society for the encouragement of free
inquiry and discussion,2 those who live in Scotland are the best judges
of the value and seasonableness of the proposal. As far as I can presume
to judge, I should think such a Society very desirable, but I feel some
doubt whether my temporary connexion with one of the Scotch
universities3 would prevent it from being thought a kind of intrusion in
me to occupy so prominent a position in it as you propose. Perhaps you
will allow me to suspend any positive answer at present and will in the

TO DAVID AMES WELLS1

Aug. 18. 1867

Dear Sir

I think that a country can sometimes, by taxing its exports, make
foreigners pay a part or even the whole of the tax. I have discussed
this question in the first paper of a volume entitled “Essays on some
Unsettled Questions of Political Economy”, and have there, as I think,
shewn that even a tax on imports is not, of necessity, wholly paid by
the home consumer, but that a part of it is sometimes paid (not by the
foreign producer, but) by the foreign consumer of the country’s exports.

But these things, though abstractedly true, are too much interfered with
by other agencies to be of much importance in practice. To confine
myself to the case of exports: it is clear that a country can only make
foreigners pay a tax on articles in which it possesses a superiority so
preeminent that it has no competition to fear. Even then, foreign
countries which cannot produce the article at all, or not at such a
price as to compete with the taxed producer, may be able to produce some
substitute for it, or something which will be accepted instead of it. In
the present day, when there are so many exporting countries, and when
the advantage of one country over another in any article is generally
limited to a small margin, the attempt to tax exports almost always
leads to the total or partial loss of that branch of trade. The latest
considerable experiment of this kind that I remember in any part of the
British possessions was in Ceylon. That island was supposed to have a
natural monopoly of cinnamon, and for many years it derived a large
revenue from an export duty; but in the end other nations either grew
cinnamon, or used something else instead: the tax had to be repealed,
and the trade, nevertheless was reduced to comparative insignificance.

I am leaving England for the Continent just when you are returning and
cannot hope to meet you again this season; but I hope that our
acquaintance will not be dropped and that we shall correspond on the
many important subjects in which we feel a common interest. I am

Dear Chadwick

I think you eminently entitled to offer yourself as a candidate for the
House of Commons; and, while I should rejoice to see you elected by any
constituency, I should deem it highly appropriate that you should be
returned by the University of London, one of the few bodies which, being
emancipated from Edition: current; Page: [1311] all local influences,
are peculiarly called on to guide their choice exclusively by the
capability of a candidate to render important public service.

The services you are capable of rendering, are of the precise kind which
will be most needed under our reformed Constitution. It is generally
felt that one of the most pressing occupations of the new Parliament
will be the better organisation of the machinery of government, which at
present, from defects of construction, produces almost the minimum of
beneficial result, at almost the maximum of cost. No one whom I know of
has devoted so great a portion of his life, or so great an amount of
mental power, as you have done, to the study of the scientific
principles of administration. The course of your official life has
continually brought you into contact with the most difficult
administrative problems, and you have so well used the opportunities it
afforded, that among all the administrative questions which you have
touched (and they are both numerous and of the highest importance) there
is hardly one on which you have not originated thoughts and suggestions
of the greatest value; some of which have been carried into effect with
distinguished success, while the merit of others has been manifested by
the consequences which have followed their neglect. On several of the
most important branches of public administration, you add to your
knowledge of principles a knowledge of details which few can rival. I
need only mention the sanitary department, the importance of which, now
so widely recognised, you were among the very first to press upon a
careless public; the various branches of the administration of relief to
the destitute; and many parts of the great subject of the education of
the poor, which is destined henceforth to be one of the most anxious
cares of our public men of all parties, and which it is next to
impossible to make really efficient except by means and on principles
repeatedly pointed out by you.

These are claims which, as it seems to me, are well entitled to
recognition from a scientific body like the University. They correspond
more exactly with the exigencies of this particular juncture, than the
merits, great as they are, of several of the other candidates; who,
moreover, are almost sure to obtain access to the House of Commons
through the ordinary channels. The time requires men who are not merely
willing to adopt, but able to originate and prepare, important
improvements; and when a man of this stamp offers his services, the
consideration of whether he is or is not a graduate of the University
sinks into insignificance.

asked to ask this of them. But, under the increased hope of ultimate
extrication for you and the Review,2 given by the surplus of your

£100 on your personal security, for which I inclose a cheque.

Since I saw you I had some conversation with Mr Grote on your affairs,

Sept. 1. 1867

Dear Mr Cairnes

I have delayed a long time fulfilling my promise to write to you on the
prospects of the Irish Education question, and you will see by the date
of this at what time and place I have first found leisure to do so. Your
long letter from Barèges was quite convincing to me, and therefore
confirmed me in all my bad auguries. The evident intention of the Tory
Government is to charter, if not to endow, a Catholic University. The
very best thing which the Liberal leaders have to oppose to this will be
Monsel’s plan,2 and the choice will lie between these two. The worst is
that I do not see what there is for a true Liberal to do but to lament;
for the only principle of opposition which could be taken up is the one
so clearly laid down in your letter, viz. that no educational
institution should be supported or aided by the State, but those which
are perfectly impartial, as the Queen’s Colleges are, in respect to
religion. But to stand upon this principle is to bind oneself to vote
against all the grants of money by the Privy Council to denominational
schools; and neither I, nor, as far as I know, any other Liberal, would
think it right to do this. The misery is that ninety nine hundredths of
England wish for only denominational places of education, and will not
support any others; & it is not practicable permanently to have only a
denominational system in England and only a mixed one in Ireland. The
denominational principle is not giving way at all in England. The
Manchester party,3 whose Edition: current; Page: [1314] plan was
originally one of purely secular education supported by a school rate,
have been obliged this year to provide in their bill that the
denominational schools might be recognized and paid, provided there was
a conscience clause. Even this, though brought in by Bruce,4 was
resisted and thrown out. The Scotch School Commission, in which Tory,
Whig and Liberal leaders all joined in recommending that schools which
all could attend should be maintained by a school rate, did not go
beyond stipulating for a conscience clause. The denominational feeling
is perhaps not quite so strong about Universities as about schools, and
there is the precedent of the London University. But this precedent only
avails for keeping up the Queen’s University, and not against creating
denominational ones. The appeal of the Irish Catholics is irresistible
by the English, as soon as the No Popery feeling no longer overrides
their principles: “you insist on denominational education for
yourselves; why then deny it to us?” If I made any prediction, it would
be that the present Government would give a charter to the Catholic
University, but that the great strength of Voluntaryism, backed by the
No Popery feeling, would oblige them to give up the endowment. Perhaps,
for the reasons you give, this result would be less noxious than
Monsel’s plan; though it would have the effect which Monsel, to me,
predicted from it, viz. that the priests and prelates who manage the
Catholic University, and who care little about secular instruction,
would compete for students by making the standard for their degrees so
contemptibly low as to degrade education in Ireland.

The (falsely called) cumulative vote in a few constituencies is of
doubtful value in itself; but as a breaking in upon the old humdrum
notions, and as necessitating the reopening of the larger question, it
is of great importance; and the discussions have given a general idea of
Hare’s system to numbers who knew nothing about it before, and have made
many converts to it. The subject is also making great way in America:
there is a Society at New York for “Personal Representation”5 of which
Dudley Field6 is one of the leaders, and I am told that Greeley and
Wendell Phillips are both favourable to the Edition: current; Page:
[1315] principle. That question, as well as women’s suffrage, is now
fairly launched in both countries. The Committee of which you and Mrs
Cairnes kindly consented to be members, now considerably exceeds 100 in
number, including two peers (Lords Romilly and Houghton), thirty members
of the House of Commons (among whom, besides the best of the Radicals, I
may mention Baines7 and Coleridge8 and many other known names, but by no
means exclusively such. Your friend Mr Webb9 joins the Society, but
modestly declines being on the Committee. I hope, however, to overcome
his objection, as such men as he is are very much wanted on the
Committee, and will be most useful as centres of local information and
exertion. Mr Webb is not sanguine about gaining much support in Ireland
at present, but it will come in time. A good many Irish liberal members
of Parliament both Catholic and Protestant have already joined the
Committee.

There is much to be said on the question of the Declaration of Paris10
which must wait till another time. I only just opened the subject in the
House of Commons at the very end of the session, but it must come up for
discussion again and again. Almost every one (except Sir Roundell
Palmer)11 seems to agree with me thus far, that if we do not go back, we
must go farther, and exempt private property from seizure even in the
vessels of the belligerent countries. This last course is advocated by
many. Lord Hobart12 (who by the way has joined the Committee of the
Women’s Suffrage Society), goes farther still, and would abolish
commercial blockades. The consequence of all this, it seems to me, would
be that the naval powers would be unable to defend themselves against
the military; and the independence of our own country could perhaps only
be preserved by our joining the American Confederation as three States,
England, Scotland and Ireland. This would at least have the advantage of
settling the Irish difficulty.

Please write to Blackheath as usual until I write to you from Avignon,
which will not be for some weeks. I hope your health is more benefitted
by Aix than it was by Barèges. I am

Before
September 3, 1867

I have long been convinced that complete justice to Ireland was scarcely
to be hoped for unless by a reform in Parliament sufficiently thorough
to take away the present preponderance of the landed interest, and
transfer a large share of political power to classes who are not under
the influence of landed or Church prejudices. There is considerable
reason to hope that the Parliamentary reform which we have now obtained
may accomplish this. Whatever power has been gained by the working
classes or by the advanced Liberals will, I am convinced, be used for
the complete redress of the grievances of Ireland on the two most
fundamental points—the Church and the land. An era of hope therefore is
opening for Ireland, which, if improved by wise and harmonious action on
the part of your representatives and ours, may make the connection
between the two countries an unalloyed benefit to both.

Je vous dois depuis longtemps une réponse à deux bonnes et intéressantes
lettres, et je dois aussi ma souscription de 10 francs à la Société des
Etudes Grecques.2 Je la comprends aujourd’hui dans un même mandat de
poste avec les cinq francs de la Ligue Internationale de la Paix3 (celle
de M. Frédéric Passy),4 vous priant de vouloir bien remettre les deux
sommes à destination. Le succès de la Société des Etudes Grecques me
fait un bien grand plaisir. Nulle part une pareille société ne saurait
être plus utile qu’en France, sans compter qu’elle réunit déjà les
hommes éclairés de la Grèce actuelle avec ceux qui apprécient le mieux
ce que la Grèce ancienne a fait et ce que les études grecques peuvent
encore faire pour le progrès de l’humanité. Je vous félicite de
l’initiative que vous avez prise dans ces deux mouvements, celui des
Etudes Grecques et celui de la paix. J’espère beaucoup plus de la
Société Passy que de celle qui s’est tant remuée à Genève. Quand on se
réunit pour prêcher la paix, il faudrait savoir se taire pour le moment
sur la diversité de ses opinions politiques.

Vous avez bien jugé le résultat de la campagne réformiste de cette année
en Angleterre. Nous avons fait un grand pas en avant, quand personne ne
s’attendait à un aussi grand. Mais lorsque la tendance générale des
choses est dans un certain sens, les intérêts même égoïstes trouvent
quelquefois leur compte à hâter le mouvement. Vous dites très bien que
“quand les gens ont l’égalité et la responsabilité, ils deviennent tout
autres”: c’est ce qui me fait hâter de mes voeux le suffrage universel,
et lutter pour y faire comprendre les femmes qui en ont certes le plus
grand besoin.

J’espère que le séjour de Trouville aura parfaitement rétabli la santé
de Madame d’Eichthal. Je vous prie de me rappeler à ses souvenirs et à
ceux de votre fils ainé, ainsi que de mon ancien ami votre frère. Je

TO WILLIAM THOMAS THORNTON1

Avignon

Oct. 19.1867

Dear Thornton—

I have just finished reading your Chapter in the Fortnightly2 & I put
down my observations while my mind is full of its contents. In execution
I think it excellent, & of good augury for the success of the book;3
for, beginning with so luminous a statement of principles & going on as
it probably will do afterwards to important practical recommendations,
it bids fair both to make a more than ordinary impression on those who
read it at first, & to be permanently distinguished from other writings
on the subject as a systematic treatise. I expect that the subsequent
chapters will be equally well executed & that I shall agree with all or
most of your practical conclusions. But in its principles the chapter
does not carry me with it. I find in it what I always find where a
standard is assumed of so called justice distinct from general utility &
supposed to be paramount whenever the two conflict, viz. that some other
standard might just as well have been assumed. Not only do I not admit
any standard of right which does not derive its sole authority from
utility, but I remark that in such cases an adversary could always find
some other maxim of justice equal in authority but leading to opposite
conclusions. Edition: current; Page: [1319] A great many rules of
morality of every day application are habitually classed as principles
of justice. You have selected one of these; Louis Blanc4 against whom
you are arguing would select others. You say, the rich are not bound to
give employment & subsistence to the poor because they had nothing to do
with bringing the poor into the world. Louis Blanc would or might say
that the riches and often the very subsistence of the rich would not
exist for them if the poor had not been brought into the world, & that
to return good for good & the product to the producer is a duty of
justice. Again, when he says that the raw material of the earth was not
given to a few or to one generation but to the human race, you answer,
admitting this, the vast majority of the poor could never have been born
if the earth had not been appropriated & compensation is only due to
them for their share of what the earth could have produced if it had
remained unappropriated. To this L.B. might answer, Compensation is due
to them not for that only but for not allowing them to appropriate their
rateable share of the soil and to obtain what they by their labour can
make that share produce. Again you argue throughout that no question of
justice can arise as to the amount for which A hires the labour of B,
because A is not bound to hire B at all. Is not this assuming that what
the jurists call a duty of imperfect obligation, i.e., not owed to an
assignable individual, is no duty? A may not be bound to hire B, but if
he is bound to hire or to benefit some person or persons at his choice,
the amount of the benefit may be an essential condition to his
fulfilment of the duty. You carry your adherence to one particular view
of moral obligation so far as to pronounce a person blameless in point
of duty (however odious otherwise) who refuses to save the life of
another without an exorbitant payment; I conceive on the contrary that
it is a serious question whether a person who can save another’s life &
does not do it even without any hope of reward, ought not to be amenable
to the criminal law. For these reasons I think that the chapter, though
as I said impressive, & though likely to be provocative of thought, will
probably not convince a single person. All who did not already agree
with you will find maxims of justice equally plausible, & in my
estimation quite equally strong in support of contrary conclusions.

What you may perhaps effect is to make some of the poor, or of their
friends, think they ought not to be severe on the rich as men for using
the advantages which their position gives them. But the more they are
persuaded of that the more determined will they be to upset the social
system which gives a few persons these advantages. They may say, it is
not A’s fault that he is rich, but they will be not the less likely to
say, let us oblige him to divide his riches equally among all & start
afresh; & they will never be persuaded by the principles of justice
which you have laid down to think this Edition: current; Page: [1320]
unjust. They would say, it may have been right to allow appropriation as
long as unappropriated land was to be had by all, but when all is
appropriated, & some are left without, there ought to be a redivision,
the γη̑ς ἀναδασμός5 of the Greeks. Nor can they be met as far as I see by
any arguments but those of expediency—which, once let in, would open the
whole question of the rights of the poor & obligations of the rich, &
would I think, lead to consequences very different from those which you
draw from your theory of justice though probably not very different from
what you would practically recommend.

I have stated strongly the fault I find with your Chapter. It would take
me a considerable space to set out all the good I find in it. To mention
only one thing, the book will be very serviceable in carrying on what
may be called the emancipation of pol. economy—its liberation from the
kind of doctrines of the old school (now taken up by well to do people)
which treat what they call economical laws, demand & supply for
instance, as if they were laws of inanimate matter, not amenable to the
will of the human beings from whose feelings, interests, & principles of
action they proceed. This is one of the queer mental confusions which
will be wondered at by & by & you are helping very much in the good work
of clearing it up.

We arrived here a few days ago & I am settling down to the winter’s work
which will not be political or economical but psychological. I am going
to prepare in concert with Bain a new edition of my father’s Analysis of
the Mind with notes and supplementary matter.6 This will be not only
very useful but a very great relief by its extreme unlikeness to
parliamentary work & to parliamentary semi-work or idleness. I hope your
health has greatly benefitted by your holiday & goes on improving.

Dear Sir—

I was glad to receive your letter because it is important to know what
an Eton master (especially one who admits defects in the institution)
says in vindication of Eton. Your defence however is mainly directed to
Edition: current; Page: [1321] other points than those which I have
attacked. I have never I believe expressed any opinion as to the merits
or defects of Eton in comparison with our other public schools. As the
one of highest pretensions I took it as the representative of them all.
Nor in what I said of moral results had I particularly in view the
grosser & more disreputable vices. I look upon the general moral state
of the educated classes of Great Britain, taken in the mass, as
essentially low & mean: a mean standard, & a contemptible falling short
even of their own standard. You will not expect that I shd, in such a
letter as the present, enter into a discussion as to the truth of this
opinion, or shew how it is verified in our whole social state & in the
manifestations which proceed from those classes on all public occasions
on which the moral aspect of the facts is the predominant one. But if
this opinion or anything approaching to it is justified by the fact, I
cannot be wrong, as you seem to think, in visiting the shortcomings or
vices of a class upon the school (or schools) which chiefly educates
that class, not as the authors or primary causes of the evil, but as
having at least been signally unsuccessful in counteracting it. The
teachers, I apprehend, are only entitled to wash their hands of the
“shortcomings or vices” of their pupils when they acknowledge & deplore
them & shew that their utmost efforts are steadily exerted in the
contrary direction.

When you say that so many of your best boys go into the Guards you say
what amounts to an acknowledgment of utter failure in educating them
morally either for the special responsibilities of a governing class or
for the universal duties of a man.

I am not called on to deny that Eton as well as other schools, is far
more successful in individual specimens than it is in the mass: & the
peculiarities which you mention in its system, the less rigid
confinement to a single curriculum & the more intimate association of
every boy with his tutor afford facilities for this which, I have no
doubt, are often taken good advantage of. But the use made of these
facilities depends on what the tutors are & that their general quality
shd [be] high is hardly consistent with what you say in your letter of
the nepotism, favoritism, & general unfitness of the body who possess
“the patronage of the chief school appointments.” From this evil you
call on Parlt2 to relieve you & on me to do what I can to help, & you
may rely on my doing so: The Public Schools Bill has been passed over by
the H of C in the last two sessions not from neglect but from the
incessant occupation of the H with the Reform Bill, & I look forward to
its occupying much of the attention of the House in the session next to
come.3

Dear Sir

I thank you for sending me your valuable Address,2 and Mr Buckalew’s
speech.3 The latter I had seen, and it is one of many signs that the
principle of the representation of minorities, and (as far as the case
admits) of all sections and opinions in proportion to their numbers, is
making rapid way in the United States. The footing, small as it is,
which the principle has obtained in our own legislation by the new
Reform Act, ensures its being discussed and rediscussed with a practical
aim, and, if so, it is sure to be, ere long, understood and appreciated.

I feel, with you, the immense importance of effecting at once all that
can be effected for the restraining of bribery; and the time is
favourable as some of the leading Tories are very much afraid of the
money power, and would now help the Liberals in the attempt to keep it
within bounds. It is true that they do this mainly in the interest of
the local influences; but no matter. The local influences are doomed:
the emancipation of the farmers has commenced; while even the
agricultural labourers are beginning to revolt against their employers.
Within a few years their children will have been put to school, and
after that, they will obtain votes. The real permanent danger now is,
lest when the labouring class become the disposers of their own votes,
they should sell them.

It is very important to get together for the next session all the best
suggestions for the suppression of corrupt practices at elections, with
a view to their being embodied in a bill which the advanced liberals
could in a body support. They might not carry it, but they would
probably be able to force a large part of its provisions upon the
Government. Some of your suggestions should certainly be included;
particularly that of making it the duty of a public officer to
prosecute. I hope you will continue thinking on the subject, and will
put on paper all available thoughts that occur to you with a view to
bringing them into a common stock at the beginning of the session. I am

Dear Bain—

I thank you very much for your letter, & for the promise of matter so
soon for the edition of the Analysis.2 I myself have not begun writing
yet, but see my way more & more clearly to the work; I have been reading
through Laromiguière,3 & Maudslay.4 The first I read chiefly to know
what he makes of the active department of human nature (that being his
strong point) from the psychological side without the physiological. On
that & on other subjects he is meritorious as far as he goes, but too
easily satisfied. In the higher departments he leaves everything
unexplained, or smuggles the explicandum into its own explanation. His
acute remarks sometimes however anticipate the thoughts which others
have worked out. I was surprised to find in him a complete anticipation
of my father’s important remark on the ambiguity of the copula.5 He also
anticipated Hamilton’s view of abstraction as distinct from
generalization,6 & his notion of the substantial identity of Nominalism
& Conceptualism.7 From Maudslay I have learnt more; but (as with most of
the physiologists) his theories seem to me to go far beyond the
evidence. I observe, by the way, that he takes Carpenter’s view,8 that
ideation is the special function of the cerebral hemispheres, sensation
(or rather something ill-defined which he calls a residuum) being packed
up there by nerve force to be manufactured into idea. If I am not
mistaken, you consider this to be obsolete and false theory. Is it not
so? A propos—why does Maudslay charge me with disparaging physiology,
Edition: current; Page: [1324] either in itself or in its application to
Mind?9 It is like Matthew Arnold enumerating me among the enemies of
culture.10

Besides these I have been toiling through Stirling’s Secret of Hegel.11
It is right to learn what Hegel is & one learns it only too well from
Stirling’s book. I say too well because I found by actual experience of
Hegel that conversancy with him tends to deprave one’s intellect. The
attempt to unwind an apparently infinite series of self contradictions
not disguised but openly faced & coined into [illegible word] science by
being stamped with a set of big abstract terms, really if persisted in
impairs the acquired delicacy of perception of false reasoning & false
thinking which has been gained by years of careful mental discipline
with terms of real meaning. For some time after I had finished the book
all such words as reflexion, development, evolution, &c., gave me a sort
of sickening feeling which I have not yet entirely got rid of.

Mansel’s article12 is very poor. It is a satisfaction to know that he
could find nothing better to say. It will cost me only a few sentences
in another edition. It is tolerably good tempered however much more so
than his last.

I am obliged to you for discouraging the idea of my lecturing for Univ.
College.13 I have so little time now that I must keep it for the few
things which it is my special duty to do before the night cometh when no
man can work. I wonder how you find time to do all you do. I look
forward to your new book14 with much pleasure.

Edition: current; Page: [1325]
I am glad that Mr Hunter15 has done so well with the article for
Chambers.16 That question is making way in a wonderful manner. In the U.
States the so called radical party seems to be taking up in a body the
equality of women as it has that of negroes. At least all the leaders
seem to be doing so, Chief Justice Chase among the rest. The Governor of
Kansas17 is said to be actually canvassing the State for the sanction by
popular suffrage of the constitutional amendment which has passed both
Houses admitting women to the franchise.

We are very well & hope to return three months hence in good condition.

Dear Chadwick

Thanks for sending me a bulletin of your progress. What you say about
the effect of your address2 is encouraging; but it is disheartening to
see that in the constituencies generally, the only power which seems
capable of making head against money is local influence. The great
question of next session will be the promised bill against electoral
corruption. The advanced Liberals must have their rival bill, and I am
anxious that all who have thought on the subject, and particularly that
you, should put down, as heads of a bill, all that has occurred to them
as desirable on this subject. When all suggestions have been got
together, the most feasible may be selected, and the best radicals in
and out of the House may be urged to combine in forcing them on the
government.

Whenever you think the time has come to form a Committee and raise a
subscription for your return to Parliament, I beg you to put me down as
I said before, for £50, and I am ready to serve on any London or General
Committee. I suppose that, for the University, the Committee must
consist of members of the constituency, which I am not; but if any
others are eligible, I should be glad to be one.

Edition: current; Page: [1326]
I have read and been duly edified by the paper you mention in the
Journal of the Society of Arts.3 I think there is a chance that Ireland
may be tried as a corpus vile for experimentation on government
management of railways and telegraphs, as well as of other things.
Certainly there is little to spoil there: the worst that could happen
would but be one more failure, and there is no necessity to fail.

Your first paper read to the Academy, I have lately received, and will
read, as well as the one which is yet to come.4 There is no difficulty
of principle in legislating for trades’ unions, but a great deal in
detail. For example on that question of picketting. The principle is
that they may persuade, but must not intimidate. But who is there to be
persuaded, in case of a strike, but those who have accepted work? and
how are they to be got at, except by watching to see who they are? and
if persuasion is permitted, can the persuader be withheld from
expressing disapprobation, and strongly too? while, as we all know, this
expression of disapprobation easily degenerates into illegitimate
intimidation. But how or where is the line to be drawn? Can more be done
than to prohibit threats? and not even that, if the mischief threatened
is not physical, but mere ill will, with its natural expression? Hardly
any one who has written on the practical question seems to me to have
faced this difficulty.

Dear Sir—

I beg to acknowledge your letter of the 23rd ulto.

I do not claim any greater latitude of making exceptions to general
rules of morality on the utilitarian theory than is accorded by
moralists on all theories. Every ethical system admits the possibility &
even frequency, of a conflict of duties. In most cases the conflict
occasions no great difficulty, because one of the duties is in general
obviously paramount to the other. The difficulty arises when the choice
is between a very great violation of a duty usually subordinate & a very
small infringement of one ordinarily of more peremptory obligation. In
such a case the former, I cannot but think, may be the greater moral
offence. When I mentioned, as a case of this kind, the case of stealing
or taking by force the food or medicine necessary for saving a life,2 I
was thinking rather of saving another person’s life than one’s own. A
much stricter rule is required in the latter case than in the former,
for the obvious reason, that there is more probability of self deception
or of dishonesty. But I am far from saying that the rule shd never be
relaxed even when the case is one’s own. A runaway slave by the laws of
slave countries commits a theft: he steals his own person from his
lawful owner. If you say, this is not morally theft, because property in
a human being ought not to exist, take the case of a child or an
apprentice who runs away on account of intolerable ill usage. There is
in the doctrine I maintain nothing inconsistent with the loftiest
estimation of the heroism of martyrs. There are times when the grandest
results for the human race depend on Edition: current; Page: [1328] the
public assertion of one’s convictions at the risk of death by torture.
When this is the case martyrdom may be a duty; & in cases when it does
not become the duty of all it may be an admirable act of virtue in
whoever does it, & a duty in those who as leaders or teachers are bound
to set an example of virtue to others, & to do more for the common faith
or cause than a simple believer. I do not know whether what I have
written will do anything towards removing your difficulty, but I have
not leisure to enter further into the subject.

TO JOHN HENRY BRIDGES1

Avignon

Nov. 16, 1867

Dear Sir—

The question which you put to me is one which, I think, every sincere
reformer of advance opinions, must have put to himself since the
outbreak of Fenianism. The answer which I have given to it for my own
guidance is this: To declare openly on all suitable occasions that
England is bound either to govern Ireland so that Ireland shall be
satisfied with her government, or to set Ireland free to govern herself.
This doctrine I have already publicly professed. At one of the Reform
Union meetings at St James’s Hall last summer I put the question to a
multitudinous assemblage composed in great part of working men, “Do you
think England has a right to retain Ireland in subjection unless she can
make her government satisfactory to the Irish?”2 & the enthusiastic
shout of “NO” from apparently the whole body of the meeting, might have
been heard, I think, outside the building. The time, therefore, is fully
come for holding this language. But having said thus much, I must now
add that I think it would be extremely wrong to say or do anything that
would give fresh encouragement to the Irish to seek separation from
England. I think so, because, for many reasons which to you need not be
stated, G. Britain & Ireland are capable of making jointly a much better
government for Ireland than Ireland alone is likely to make: but still
more because I believe that in the present state of English opinion an
attempt at separation even if supported by the mass of the Irish people
would be put down by the strong hand, would cause immense misery in
Ireland & greatly embitter the feelings between Irish & English &
between the two parties in Ireland. And the Irish of the class which
furnishes separatists Edition: current; Page: [1329] are so excitable &
so devoid of common sense that a very little encouragement from any
reputable quarter in G. Britain might have a stimulating effect on them
such as we cannot limit or calculate. The responsibility therefore of
giving even a single word of encouragement is such as I shd be very
sorry that any English liberal shd assume.

The parallel of Hungary3 seems to me to fail in the most essential
particulars. The Hungarian people have shewn throughout a most
remarkable amount of the esprit de conduite—a good sense, a calm &
judicious appreciation of means & ends, which prove them to be highly
qualified both for acquiring & for preserving national independence &
free institutions. In this respect they are a complete contrast to the
Irish. Moreover, the Hungarians are a full match in military qualities
or resources, for the whole remainder of the Austrian empire & therefore
any terms of accommodation deliberately agreed upon between them & the
other half has a considerable chance of being kept and after all the
success of the experiment of two independent legislatures & governments
under the same crown royal is as yet very doubtful, & it is far too soon
to predict its results. Still less likely is it that this Dualism shd
succeed in Ireland. The question there is not Repeal but Separation.
There is not a Fenian who would be content with a separate legislature.
They all seem to want total separation, & a republic, and total
separation is what I think we must make up our minds to if after having
done full justice to the Irish in church & land matters & done all we
can do for their educational & economical interests we find that their
aversion to union with us remains unabated. But for their friends in
England to begin already pointing to separation even in the distance,
would be the very way to make the Irish separately resolve that nothing
else shd succeed.

At present the Irish members of the H. of C. of the extreme party
instead of “regarding the efforts of English radicals with antipathy,”
are on such terms of cordial alliance & cooperation with them as I do
not believe ever was the case before: they are, apparently for the first
time, convinced that the popular party in England really feels to them
as fellow countrymen, & really wishes to do them complete justice, & are
fixing their hopes more & more on helping that party to acquire the
power of doing so. They seem to dread Fenianism extremely, & some of
them have said to me that if the two countries were separated, there
would be a civil war in Ireland. The only important point on which most
of the advanced liberals differ from the representatives of the Irish
party is the question of denominational education: If we escape
quarreling on that point there is every prospect of a closer & closer
alliance between us. I look therefore with more hope on the cultivation
of that alliance than on any proceeding by English liberals which would
give gain de cause to the Separatist party in Ireland.

Edition: current; Page: [1330]
This is the way in which the subject presents itself to my mind. If it
adds anything to your materials of thought on the question I shall be
very glad that you have done me the honour of writing to me about it.

As I am at present fully engaged upon work in which I think it desirable
to employ all the time of the Parliamentary recess, it is not my
intention to be in England for the short autumn session2 unless it
should be absolutely necessary. My apology for troubling you with this
letter is, that I should consider myself bound by your judgment as to
what constitutes necessity; that is to say, the importance of any
particular point at issue, and the probable closeness of the division
upon it. More especially if the Government should propose to provide for
the expenses of the Abyssinian expedition3 by an ordinary loan, or by
bonds of long date, and you should think it advisable to take the sense
of the House on a counter proposition to raise the whole of the supplies
within the year, or partly by bonds to be paid off in a year or two
years; which would probably be in accordance with your opinions, and
would be entirely so with mine; and if the House were almost equally
divided so that every vote was of importance; I should feel it an
absolute duty to be present. My object, therefore, in taking the liberty
of troubling you with this letter, is to say that if I could receive a
telegram from Mr Glyn4 any day before twelve o’clock (which I believe I
could do if it were sent off from London early in the morning) I could
be in London by eight or nine o’clock of the night of the following day.

Dear Mr Christie

Electoral corruption will, as you say, be the most important subject of
the next session,2 and we should endeavour to induce those who have
thought on it with a view to practical legislation, to bring their
suggestions into a common stock, that they may be sifted, and a
selection made of all which are likely to be efficacious, to be made the
basis of a Bill, such as the advanced Liberals might in a body support.
Few have taken so much pains with the subject as you have, and I hope
you will draw up the heads of such a measure as you would yourself
propose if you were a minister. Those, whether in or out of Parliament,
who have contributed to this stock of suggestions might meet together as
soon as Parliament reassembles in February and produce an outline of a
Bill which might be circulated among the Liberal party. It might be
possible to prevail on Mr Gladstone to introduce it: but whoever may do
so, the Bill will only be a rallying point: the fight will not be on
that, but on the attempt to engraft its provisions on the bill of the
Tory Government. I have already spoken or written to several of those
who have most considered the subject, and I hope we shall succeed in
getting together really good materials for a Bill.

I quite agree with you on the importance, on all accounts, of including
municipal elections in the measure.

Dear Bain—

I have received your letter & the packet of MS. The death of Clark2 is a
painful surprise to me. I had heard from him several times since I left
England & his last letter dated as late as the 15th of November was more
than usually lively & varied, discussing Berkeleianism, the psychology
of the senses, &c. It was very unlike a person so near his end. Of what
illness did he die?

I shall be happy to nominate Mr Findlater as my Assessor for the
remainder of the term,3 if you will be kind enough to ascertain for me
whether he will accept the office & to give me his complete name & the
designation by which I shd describe him to the St Andrews people when
they write to me on the subject. Any probability of a vacancy in the
Moral Philosophy chair during the period makes it extremely important to
have in the University Court a man whose views on that subject are
likely to agree with ours. No doubt you will be on the look out for a
fit person to fill that professorship if the vacancy occurs. I shall
probably have to depend chiefly upon your knowledge of available
Scotchmen for the purpose.

I am very thankful to you for having found, & indeed made, time to do so
much for the Analysis.4 I like all your notes very much & they all
supply valuable matter most of which I could not have made out by
myself. The only case in which we have gone over the same ground is the
case of Association by Resemblance, on which I have also written, to the
same general Edition: current; Page: [1333] effect as you; & I propose
to retain both, as they do not repeat, but enlarge & strengthen one
another. Yours is, I think, one of the very best of the present batch. I
also have been working pretty vigorously, & have exactly got through the
first volume. I have written (as far as regards the rough draft) a great
number of minor notes & several long ones, the two longest being on the
subjects that you particularly recommended to me, Belief & Nominalism. I
have no doubt that I shall get through the second volume in the same
manner by the meeting of Parlt. What will remain for the next recess
will be the rewriting, which will probably involve much enlargement as
well as improvement. But I shall not commence this until your part of
the work is finished & before me. I shall be particularly glad of any
notes on the chapter on Memory as that phenomenon is still to me the
great unresolvable fact of Psychology. It seems to me that it & the
problem of Belief are in fact the same, viz. that which I have stated in
the chapter on the Ego in my book on Hamilton5—the distinction between
recognising something as a mere thought & as an actual fact.

There are two subjects which my knowledge is unequal to, & on which I
hope you will give me further assistance. One of them is the direct
relation between Ideas & states of the nerves. You must have observed
that the source of some of the chief imperfections of the Analysis is
the author’s steady refusal to admit any production of ideas by physical
causes except through the medium of sensations raising up ideas already
associated with them. He carries this so far, as to explain the fact
that chronic indigestion excites feelings of anxiety by the circumstance
that anxiety disorders the digestion. You have just touched this topic
in one of your notes, but in a very summary manner. The other point is
one which I could, if necessary, get up from your Grammar without
troubling you: it is the distinctive characters of the Subordinate Parts
of Speech. Your view of the Adjective I believe coincides with my
father’s, that it serves for making cross divisions. You could however
help me very much if you had time to annotate those sections. There is
one point which I am quite unequal to. The philology of the Analysis on
the subject of prepositions, conjunctions, &c. though right in principle
is now obsolete in detail & I do not know who is the best person to ask
to amend it. Can you suggest the right person?6

I have not found any help in Bailey7 for dealing with Nominalism though
he objects to the same points in my father’s exposition which I object
to. I have however derived some benefit from reading again Bailey’s four
volumes; Edition: current; Page: [1334] but how very, very shallow he
is! He not only cannot seize any of the less obvious applications of the
principle of association, but he is unfeignedly unable to make out what
the writers who speak of such things can possibly mean. Yet at the same
time, how plausible! He has scarcely his equal in skimming over the
hollow places in philosophy, & putting a smooth face on unsolved
difficulties. If he had been in the Forum at the time of Curtius he
would not have leaped into the gulf,8 but would have thrown a platform
over it, by which people might walk across without noticing it. When he
attempts to confute those who are trying to resolve difficulties which
he does not see, he usually does it by formally stating & developing at
great length some elementary truth which he fancies to be all there is
in the matter. As elementary truths are very often lost sight of, these
elaborate enforcements of them are, in many cases, useful, but are
seldom at all germane to the particular controversy. The best thing
about him (except his chapters on the moral sentiments) is that he is a
decided supporter of the “experience hypothesis”: but he is so in a way,
& in a sense, peculiarly his own: What used to be called the mundus
intelligibilis, consisting of all the obscurer notions which have
wearied & divided metaphysicians, he disposes of by maintaining that the
Intelligible world is all perceived through the senses. Why puzzle
ourselves about the necessity of any of our beliefs? Necessity is a
quality of outward facts, & can be seen. We see that the theorems of
geometry are necessary. How absurd to seek for an explanation or a
definition of Cause! We see one thing cause another.

How different Herbert Spencer whose Psychology9 I have been reading for
the third time! The second of his four parts is admirable as a specimen
of analysis. It is a great satisfaction to find how closely his results
coincide with ours. I hope he will not make the book worse instead of
better in the projected rewriting, as I am afraid he is going to do with
his Social Statics.10

The long miscellaneous chapter with which the 2nd volume of the Analysis
commences will give us a great deal of occupation—for under the guise of
explaining names it contains the author’s solutions of most of the great
questions of metaphysics proper. I shall hope by & by for a full note
from you on the Will whether I write one myself or no. The original
generation of Will which Hartley had the first glimpse of11 but which
you have been the first to understand thoroughly, will be much better
treated by you than by me. I may perhaps add something of my own on the
polemics of the subject.

Dear Chadwick

I received your letter and proof2 yesterday afternoon and I read the
proof immediately on receiving it. Like most things you write, it is
full of instructive and important details, but I differ from you on the
point of its being impossible for Trades Unions to raise wages. The only
reason I can find assigned in the article for this opinion is that if
they do raise wages, they increase the cost of production and price of
the product, and thereby lessen the demand and bring wages down again.
But increased wages do not necessarily raise the price of the article
(nor even make competition with foreigners more difficult) so long as
there is any margin of profits to take the increase from. Of course
neither Trades Unions, nor anything else can permanently raise wages so
high as not to leave a rate of profit sufficient to encourage
accumulation. But if they limit their attempt within reasonable bounds,
I do not see why they should not in many cases succeed, both in raising
wages, and in (what is equivalent) diminishing the hours of labour. The
rules laid down by some Unions against piecework, or against machinery,
or against the admission of more than a limited number of persons into
the trade, and so forth, appear to me as noxious as they do to you,
though I do not see how legislation can interfere with people for
annexing these conditions to the acceptance of work, provided they do
not use force, or threats of force, to prevent other workmen from
accepting it. I have marked in pencil, on the margin of the proof, one
or two places where something seems omitted which is necessary to the
grammar.

I infer from the newspapers that the public are half crazy about
Fenianism.3 Gladstone’s Lancashire speeches4 will, however, I hope have
some effect in recalling some of them to common calmness and ordinary
good feeling.

You will find in the Parliamentary reports on Petitions for the session
1867 the statement of the number of signatures to petitions sent up to
Parliament, begging for the extension of the suffrage to women. The
number, as far as my memory serves me, was about 13000. Of these, many
were men; there does not exist, that I am aware of, any statement of
what proportion: probably, however, considerably less than half. A
petition was also presented the year before, for the same object, signed
by 1500 persons, all women.

I am Sir
 yours very faithfully

Dear Sir—

I shd be glad to know at once what proposal you are prepared to make for
a new edition of the Logic2 supposing that no cheap edition is issued;
also on what conditions you would propose to issue a cheap edition3 & in
case of my acceding to them what difference this would make in your
proposals for a new library edition. I shd be obliged if you will be so
good as to send me the sheets of the last ed. of the Logic here as soon
as possible.

Dear Mr Christie

I am glad that your ideas for a Bribery Bill are put on paper, and will
soon be published.2 I quite agree with you as to the importance of
including Municipal elections. Your other point, that of having an
enquiry as a matter of course after all elections, I had not thought of.
One can at once see many reasons in its favour, but it will be a
difficult thing to get carried, owing to the habitual objection to
“fishing” enquiries, and to enquiries when there is no complaint. It is,
however, evident that the absence of complaint is, in such a case, no
evidence of the absence of mischief.

I forget if you have ever expressed any opinion on requiring a
declaration on honour from members of parliament, and if so on the terms
in which it should be drawn up. Other points are, What should be the
punishment of the convicted briber? Should not all persons proved to
have been agents of bribery, be for ever interdicted from acting as
election agents? Should not all monies expended for election purposes
pass through a public officer, so that the mere fact of incurring
expenditure in which he is passed over should be legal proof of an
unlawful purpose? If so, what should be the definition of election
purposes?

Further, it is quite as necessary to deal with what are at present
lawful expenses as with actual corruption. They are as mischievous, and
even as demoralizing politically, though not so depraving privately. The
Liberals ought to force on both subjects in the approaching session.

As Disraeli means to bring in his Bill on the very day of reassembling,3
I think it will be wiser to try to get a conference after than before
that time. If it were tried before, some desirable people would be
absent, and others would say “Let us wait till we see the Bill.” But the
Bill being almost sure to be grossly inadequate, it will then be easier
to get people to join in an effort to extort something better.

Dear Sir:

I am much obliged by your kind offices to Lord Amberley2 and Mr Morley,3
both of whom will, I am convinced, not only derive great benefit from
any knowledge they acquire of America as it really is, but will make
excellent use of that knowledge, and will help to spread it more widely
when they return home.

I am afraid we differ rather fundamentally in our opinions on the
justice and policy of exclusive taxation on what is called realized
property. I have gone very fully into the question in the chapter on
Taxation in the concluding work of my Principles of Political Economy,4
and it would not be possible in a letter to explain myself so fully or
so clearly. But it seems to me contrary both to the rule of equal
justice and to economical policy, to tax one person because he has
saved, and leave another untaxed, because he has spent all his gains on
himself and family, without adding anything to the accumulated means of
further production. The contribution you propose to levy for the payment
of the national debt would be simply taking away from everybody who had
laid by anything for distant purpose, the greater part of the whole of
his savings, while the self-indulgent who have spent all in present
pleasures would escape altogether, though benefitted as much as any one
else by the protection of government. It seems to me a very narrow view
of the purposes of government to suppose that it is only of use to the
possessors of accumulated capital. It protects, or at least is bound to
protect, every body’s life, person and dignity from injury and insult;
and even as regards pecuniary matters, those who spend all they get have
as much objection to its being taken from them by malefactors as those
who save. You say that those who would be left untaxed would, in
consequence, have more means of saving; but being already persons who
are less frugal in their disposition than others of the same means, they
are still less likely to save when a large part of their savings would
not be at their own disposal, but would be taken by the State.

On the mere economic question, “is there any way in which an annual tax
may be collected from capital without leaving to the latter an
opportunity to collect it back from labor?” I should answer that capital
will not have this opportunity. I do not believe that the burthens laid
on the capitalist ever fall on labor, except in one way, viz: if the
burthens are so heavy as to Edition: current; Page: [1339] check the
accumulation of capital, and prevent it from keeping up with the
increase of population; in which case, without doubt, wages would fall,
unless the increased numbers migrated to a less crowded field for the
employment of labor, such as your Western Territories.

The objections to special taxes on capital accumulated by personal
frugality, do not in the same degree apply to inherited property; and I
am quite in favor of some special taxation of all inheritances above a
small amount—and graduated taxation too; a percentage rising with the
amount of the inheritance.

I would also have no direct tax on such incomes as are only sufficient
to give mere necessaries of life and health to an average family; nor
would I have any indirect taxes on the necessaries of life and health;
though I would on the luxuries, even of the poor; especially luxuries
which are apt to be noxious, such as intoxicating drinks. Your cotton
tax comes within the class of taxes on necessaries, and is therefore, I
think, a bad tax; but not knowing in which manner it is levied, I do not
feel certain as to its exact incidence. I should suspect that it is
partly a tax on the laborer; not however by depressing money wages, but
by making them not go so far as they otherwise would, in the purchase of
clothing.

TO MARY CARPENTER1

Dec. 29, 1867

Dear Madam

I have to thank you for your letter of Aug. 112 which a journey of some
length on the Continent and much occupation ever since have prevented me
from answering before now.

If you think that to give your name in aid of the movement for political
enfranchisement of women might be in any degree injurious to the work
you have chosen, I cordially agree that those who are working in another
department than your own for the public good have no claim upon you.
Whether giving your name to our Society would have any such mischievous
effect you are far better qualified to judge than I am, and I will not
therefore Edition: current; Page: [1340] venture an opinion. I will
content myself with thanking you for the pleasure with which I learn
from your letter that you are with us in principle, and with expressing
the hope that the time may not be very far distant when the progress of
events and of public opinion may remove the obstacles which prevent you
from joining us.

There are however one or two points in your letter in which I cannot
agree with you. To take the most important first, most important because
it is a point of moral obligation. You say you do not desire a vote for
yourself. I have too great a respect for you not to venture to say that
in my opinion this is a dereliction of the duty you owe to your fellow
creatures. If your vote could affect only yourself, that is to say if
you only could be the sufferer, materially speaking, from allowing
yourself to be governed by others, it would still be a question whether
unless those others govern you with perfect justice, you are morally
entitled to forego the right and power which a vote would give you to
force them to do justice, and thereby become themselves better moral
creatures. But it is not the fact that the possession of a vote would
enable you only to protect yourself. Every citizen possessed of a vote
is possessed of a means of protecting those who cannot vote, such as
infants, the sick, idiots &c. as well as of a means of helping others
who can vote to do good in every conceivable way in which just and
provident legislation can affect human happiness. I am deeply persuaded
that nothing but a most regrettable absence of thought on this subject
can account for or even partially excuse, for wholly excuse it cannot,
the very common neglect of the power of voting which prevails among
gentlemen and educated persons. I am certain that a time will come when
it will be felt that a man, and I need not add a woman too, because any
rational creature, is committing a most gross dereliction of duty when
he habitually neglects to make use of this power conscientiously and at
any cost of labour to himself. He owes it as a return to the
civilisation to which he owes not only all the security and peace, all
the highest enjoyments of his life, but also the possibility of
attaining refinement and moral elevation. He owes it therefore by the
deepest debt that man can owe to his fellow creatures. Nor is it less
imperative that he should pay it because if the duty of voting is not
fulfilled from virtuous and public motives the power of voting will be
left to people who are induced to exercise it by the spur of selfish
interest or ambition. Thus I can conceive no duty not even the most
primary duties of private and personal morality, that it is more
absolutely essential to the happiness of mankind that every virtuous and
rational citizen should fulfill steadily and carefully. The right of
voting is in my opinion not only a power to be coveted (although it is a
legitimate power which may be honestly coveted by an honourable
ambition) but it is still more essentially an obligation to be dutifully
fulfilled.

You will see from this that I cannot agree in the wish you express that
the Edition: current; Page: [1341] right should rather be “given to
woman by those who deprived her of it than from her own demand.” Because
even if any sentiment of generosity should make one feel that it is a
more beautiful thing to receive a legitimate power unasked than asked,
there can be no generosity and nothing noble or beautiful in waiting to
have a duty thrust upon one instead of asking to be allowed to take it
upon oneself for the good of every one concerned.

In regard to the third point on which you express yourself
uncertain—whether the time has yet come for agitation—there are several
reasons which concur to make me think it has. In the first place to
agitate for the change in the law is not to obtain it; and therefore
even if any of us think that women are not yet prepared to exercise the
suffrage, that will still not be a reason against agitating for it,
because much smaller changes than this can never be obtained until after
the agitation for them has lasted some time, and the agitation itself
will be the most effectual means of preparing people for the change
whenever it comes.

The great change now taking place in the right of voting among men3 is
however the main reason for bringing forward this question at this
particular time. The subject of the right of voting is under discussion,
and people’s minds are comparatively open to receiving new ideas on the
subject. If it is true that women ought to vote, it is wrong to lose the
present opportunity of spreading this truth as far and wide as possible.
By doing so we are only sowing seed to bear fruit in due time if it is
good seed suited to the soil and the climate. We do not dream of reaping
the harvest directly.

I have troubled you, dear Madam, with a very long letter, but I agree
too much with you not to wish to agree still further.

I am, &c.

Dear Mr Hare

It gave me great pleasure to hear from you. The news you give of the
acceptance by the Reform League of the proposed conference2 may turn
Edition: current; Page: [1342] out very important. There are a number of
the most intelligent leaders of the working men in the League, and even
in the Council; men who have not the silly aversion of most of the
well-to-do people to anything new in politics, and who are capable of
understanding, and accustomed to requiring, general principles of some
sort as a basis of their convictions. If you could make an impression on
two or three of these—if you could make a convert of even one such man
as Odger,3 or Cremer,4 or Howell5—the gain would be immense.

I am glad you have seen Dudley Field,6 and I hope your communications
with him will continue. I was asked some time ago to meet him at Paris,
but as I did not go to Paris during his stay, nothing came of it.

Mr Rathbone’s Lecture7 was calculated to be very useful to the people it
was addressed to. Though the philosophy of it is not profound, its
tendency and spirit, and many of its practical recommendations, are very
valuable. It indicates a good kind and type of person: in addition to
which he seems either to hold, or to be much inclined to, many right
opinions, among others the enfranchisement of women, and Personal
Representation. There are a great number of signs, of which this lecture
is one, that the general moral and social condition of the country and
of the world are inspiring many people with serious reflections of a
very novel kind, and especially with an anxious interest about the
future; as a consequence of which we may hope to see a great increase of
efforts to deal with the primordial sources of national evils, and at
all events a far greater willingness to listen to suggestions of
improvement the grounds of which do not lie on the surface.

I was glad to hear about the Philomathic society,8 but I am obliged to
decline all invitations like the one in question.

I should say something about the proposal to change the petition for
women’s suffrage into one for a Declaratory Act, if Helen had not gone
so fully into that question in her letter to Miss Hare. Her reasons seem
to me conclusive, and I quite share her fear lest talking
extrajudicially about a right which Parliament does not wish women to
possess, should lead to removing all doubts by a declaratory Act the
wrong way. I am

TO FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE1

Avignon

Dec. 31. 1867

Dear Madam

You will readily believe that only the pressure of constant occupation
has prevented me from replying earlier to the interesting letter I
received from you in August. If you prefer to do your work rather by
moving the hidden springs than by allowing yourself to be known to the
world as doing what you really do, it is not for me to make any
observations on this preference (inasmuch as I am bound to presume that
you have good reasons for it) other than to say that I much regret that
this preference is so very general among women. Myself—but then I am a
man—I cannot help thinking that the world would be better if every man,
woman, and child in it could appear to others in an exactly true light;
known as the doer of the work that he does, and striving neither to be
under nor overvalued. I am not so “Utopian” as to suppose that bad
people will very readily lend themselves to this programme; but I
confess to considerable regret that good women should so often be almost
as fond of false appearances as bad men and women can be; seeking as
much to hide their good deeds as the others do to hide their bad ones;
forgetting probably the while that they are putting somebody—more or
less willing—in the position of a false pretender to merits not his own,
but belonging legitimately to the lady who delights to keep in the
background.

I know that it often appears, in practical matters, that one can get a
great deal of work done swiftly and apparently effectually, by working
through others; securing perhaps in this way their zealous cooperation
instead of their jealous (or perhaps only stupid) obstruction. In the
long run, however, I doubt whether any work is ever so well done as when
it is done ostensibly and publicly under the direction or at the
instigation of the original mind that has seen the necessity of doing
it. Whether this is the fact or not, I am quite certain that were the
world in general to know how much of all its important work is and
always has been done by women, the knowledge would have a very useful
effect upon it, and I am not certain that any woman who possesses any
talent whatever could make a better use of it in the present stage of
the world than by simply letting things take their natural course, and
allowing it to be known just as if she were a man. I know that this is
not pleasant to the sensitive character fostered by the present
influences among the best women; but it is to me a question whether the
noble, and as I think, Edition: current; Page: [1344] heroic enthusiasm
of truth and public good ought not in this age to nerve women to as
courageous a sacrifice of their most justly cherished delicacy, as that
of which the early Christian women left an example for the reverent love
and admiration of all future time. I have no doubt that the Roman ladies
thought them very indelicate.

In regard to the questions you do me the honour to ask me—first, “Are
there not evils which press much more hardly on women than not having a
vote?” 2dly “May not this, when obtained, put women in opposition to
those who withhold from them these rights, so as to retard still further
the legislation necessary to put them in “possession of their rights?”
3dly “Could not the existing disabilities as to property and influence
of women be swept away by the legislature as it stands at present?”

To answer these questions fundamentally would require only to state
fundamental principles of political liberty, and to reiterate that
debate so nobly carried on in our own history whether social happiness
or dignity, commercial liberty, religious freedom, or any form of
material prosperity, is or is not best founded on political liberty.

It may be granted in the abstract, that a ruling power, whether a
monarch, a class, a race, or a sex, could sweep away the disabilities of
the ruled. The question is, has it ever seemed to them urgent to sweep
away these disabilities, until there was a prospect of the ruled getting
political power? More than this, it is probably a question whether it is
in human nature that it ever should seem to them urgent.

In the same way it may often be a question whether painful symptoms do
not press more hardly upon a patient than the hidden disease which is
the cause of them. And undoubtedly, if the symptoms themselves are
killing, the physician had better address himself to them at once, and
leave the disease alone for a time. But if the oppressions and miseries
under which women suffer are killing, women take a great deal of killing
to kill them. God knows I do not undervalue these miseries; for I think
that man, and woman too, a heartless coward whose blood does not boil at
the thought of what women suffer; but I am quite persuaded that if we
were to remove them all tomorrow, in ten years new forms of suffering
would have arisen; for no earthly power can ever prevent the constant
unceasing unsleeping elastic pressure of human egotism from weighing
down and thrusting aside those who have not the power to resist it.
Where there is life there is egotism, and if men were to abolish every
unjust law today, there is nothing to prevent them from making new ones
tomorrow; and moreover, what is of still greater importance, new
circumstances will constantly be arising, for which fresh legislation
will be needed. And how are you to ensure that such legislation will be
just, unless you can either make men perfect, or give women an equal
voice in their own affairs? I leave you to judge which is the easiest.

Edition: current; Page: [1345]
What, however, constitutes an even more pressing and practical reason
for endeavouring to obtain the political enfranchisement of women,
instead of endeavouring to sweep away any or all of their social
grievances, is, that I believe it will be positively easier to obtain
this reform, than to obtain any single one of all the others, all of
which must inevitably follow from it. To prefer to sweep away any of
these others first, is as though one were to prefer to cut away branch
after branch, giving more labour to each branch than one need do to the
trunk of the tree.

The third question, whether there is not danger of political
partisanship and bitterness of feeling between men and women, is also a
question which I think has been asked and answered in other departments
of politics. It has been asked and answered, too, though the answer has
been different from that which we most of us approve of in politics, in
the case of marriage. To prevent quarrels, it has been thought best to
make one party absolute master of both. No doubt, if women can never do
anything in politics except for and through men, they cannot be
partisans against men. No doubt, where you have death, you have none of
the troubles of life. But if women were to prove possessed with ever so
great a spirit of partisanship, and were they to call forth thereby ever
so intense partisanship on the part of men, and were they, as the
weakest, to be driven to any extremities, I don’t see that the result
would be very different from what it is at present, inasmuch as I
apprehend that the present position of women in every country in the
world is exactly measured by the personal and family affections of men,
and that every modification for the better in women’s absolute
annihilation and servitude is at present owing not to any sense of
abstract right or justice on the part of men, but to their sense of what
they would like for their own wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters.
Political partisanship against the mass of women will not, among
civilized men, diminish the sense of what is due to the objects of their
private affections. But I believe, on the contrary, that the dignity
given to women in general by the very fact of their being able to be
political partisans, is likely to be itself a means of raising men’s
estimation of what is due to them. So that, if men come to look upon
women as a large number of unamiable but powerful opponents and a small
number of dearly loved and charming persons, I think men will think more
highly of women, and will feel less disposed to use badly any superior
power that after all they themselves may still possess, than if they
look upon women as I think men generally do at present, as a few dearly
loved, preeminently worthy and charming persons, and a great number of
helpless fools.

On the whole, then, I think, firstly, that political power is the only
security against every form of oppression; secondly, that at the present
day in England it would be easier to attain political rights for such
women as have the same claims as enfranchised men, than to obtain any
other considerable reform in Edition: current; Page: [1346] the position
of women; thirdly, I see no danger of party spirit running high between
men and women and no possibility of its making things worse than they
are if it did.

Finally, I feel some hesitation in saying to you what I think of the
responsibility that lies upon each one of us to stand steadfastly and
with all the boldness and all the humility that a deep sense of duty can
inspire, by what the experience of life and an honest use of our own
intelligence has taught us to be the truth. I will confess to you that I
have often stood amazed at what has seemed to me the presumption with
which persons who think themselves humble set bounds to the capacities
of improvement of their fellow creatures—think themselves qualified to
define how much or how little of the divine light of truth can be borne
by the world in general; assume that none but the very élite can see
what is perfectly clear to themselves, and think themselves permitted to
dole out in infinitesimal doses that daily bread of truth upon which
they themselves live, and without which the world must come to an end.
When I see this to me inexplicable form of moderation in those who
nevertheless believe that the truth of which they have got hold really
is the truth, I rejoice that there are so many presumptuous persons who
think themselves bound to say what they think true—who think that if
they have been fortunate enough to get hold of a truth, they cannot do a
better service to their fellow creatures than by saying it openly; who
think that the truth that has not been too much for themselves will not
be too much for others; who think that what they have been capable of
seeing, other people will be capable of seeing too, without a series of
delicately managed gradations. I even go so far as to think that we owe
it to our fellow creatures and to posterity to struggle for the
advancement of every opinion of which we are deeply persuaded. I do not,
however, mean to say that there is any judge but our own conscience of
how we can best work for the advancement of such truths, nor do I mean
to say that it may not be right for any of us, endowed with special
faculties, to choose out special work, and to decline to join in work
for which we think others better qualified and which we think may impede
us for our own peculiar province. Therefore, while I have seen with much
regret that you join in so few movements for the public good, I have
never presumed to think you wrong, because I have supposed that your
abstinence arose from your devotion to one particular branch of
public-spirited work.

être morts. En conséquence, j’ai à vous proposer soit de diminuer dans
la même proportion le paiement annuel soit de m’accorder d’autres arbres
pour compléter le nombre primitif. Je préfèrerais que la concession fût
modifiée de manière à la borne à 43 arbres ou même à 42 ce qui donnerait
la pierre milliaire du premier kilomètre du chemin comme borne très

s’opposent à ce que vous m’accordiez cette modification je vous prierais

Dear Sir

I thank you for the opportunity of reading the little pamphlet on
education.2 All that the author says against centralizing the education
of the country in the hands of government is very just, & I entertain
the strongest objections to any plan which would give a practical
monopoly to schools under government control. But I have never conceived
compulsory education in Edition: current; Page: [1348] that sense. What
I understand by it is that all parents should be required to have their
children taught certain things, being left free to select the teachers,
but the sufficiency of the teaching being ensured by a government
inspection of schools & by a real & searching examination of pupils. The
actual provision of schools by a local rate would not necessarily be
required if any schools already existed in the locality which were
sufficient for the purpose or which could be made so by aid from the
local funds & by inspection. Moreover, a mere consolidation of the
already existing school endowments, now mostly jobbed or, at best, very
inefficiently applied, would probably enable good instruction to be
provided in all localities in which it is not already afforded by
private exertions. Of course there must be a Government department to
control the employment of these funds, but it does not follow that the
teachers need be appointed or directly controlled by any public office.
The control might rest in a school committee chosen from the locality
itself, perhaps by a mixed system of election & nomination & entrusted
with considerable latitude as to all details. These are all points for
mature consideration; but a thorough system of instruction for the whole
country we must have; & I do not see anything short of a legal
obligation which will overcome the indifference, the greed, or the
really urgent pecuniary interest of parents.

TO WILLIAM DOUGAL CHRISTIE1

Jan. 8. 1868

Dear Mr Christie

I am very much obliged to you both for your letter and for sending me
your pamphlet2 and the Bill. In order not to delay returning you the
pamphlet (which goes by this post) I have copied out its list of
recommendations. I think almost all of them excellent. Above all, you
seem to me to be right in having everywhere one public officer who shall
perform all the duties connected with elections, and who shall be
specially responsible (as far as it is possible to make him so) for
doing everything that can be done to keep them pure. You have also
perceived the necessity of having an appeal from his decision; since
otherwise he would acquire, in the cases not contested before Edition:
current; Page: [1349] him by the parties, & would carry into the others
a habit of indulgence and laisser-aller which would make him as little
to be relied on as the Poor Law Inspectors have come to be. But do you
not think that the jurisdiction in appeal should be (as the Select
Committee propose that the original jurisdiction should be) with one of
the Judges, rather than with five M.P.’s named by the Speaker, and a
legal Assessor? These M.P.’s would never be impartial. It could not be
hoped that they would be better selected than the present Chairmen of
Election Committees, and the evidence which you quote from the Corrupt
Practices Report shews how confidently parties rely on the partiality of
these.

I am acquainted with the Blue Book of 1860,3 having gone carefully
through it some time ago. I am aware of the failure of the Election
Auditors; but they were sure to be a failure like Railway Auditors,
unless a great deal more was done to ensure their fidelity than was
provided for by the Act which created them. I see that we quite agree on
the subject, as you give all the powers of the Election Auditor to your
Returning Officer, who, if your plan were adopted, would be a very
different sort of person from the Election Auditors, and far more in the
public eye. I am glad that you require all election expenses to pass
through the Returning Officer. I would make him the direct dispenser
even of all charities on the part of the member or candidate; otherwise
these are sure to be so bestowed as to “keep up the . . . interest.”

The Bill, as altered by the Select Committee, has more good points than
I expected. But the £1000 security is a bar to its making much practical
improvement. Some such provision is perhaps necessary on Disraeli’s
plan,4 to prevent frivolous petitions by men of straw who could not be
made to pay costs. But all such necessity would be obviated by your plan
of having an enquiry and scrutiny after every election, by a special
officer whose business it would be to watch over elections.

The Bill provides a better system of penalties for bribery than I
expected. It is perhaps better that the disqualifications (being so
comprehensive and severe as they are) should be for seven years, as
proposed, rather than for life; since if they were for life there would
be much danger that opinion would be indulgent to every excuse for not
inflicting them.

I quite agree with you as to the inutility of the Cobden Club2 unless it
makes itself an instrument for diffusing good opinions, and several
members of the Club have already expressed to me the same feeling. Mr
Potter3 who, I believe, is the real founder of the Club, has told me
that he very much wishes to make it useful as a political organ. I think
it very desirable that your suggestions should be brought before the
managing Committee. This I could do, either by writing them a letter
enclosing yours, or by attending a meeting of the Committee (for I am a
member, though I have never acted as such) as soon as possible after my
return to England, and bringing the subject regularly before them. I
will do whichever of the two you prefer. Some good will be done if the
Club can be prevailed on to take even a small step in the direction of
your proposals. The largest measure you suggest, that of pressing for a
Congress to reconsider the international law of Europe on the subject of
the commencement of hostilities, has not the smallest chance of leading
to anything practical, but the value of the demonstration might be
considerable.

destined to lead the way in this great question, as it has already done
in so many others. I learn with great pleasure the formation of your

subscriptions to your association, and should I have any likely
opportunity I will not fail to mention your association among our
friends in England, but the cause has in this country, as yet, so few
supporters that those among us who are able to give pecuniary help find
all their available means absorbed by the expenses necessary for
diffusing the principles in our own country. You will hear with interest

I have inclosed your two letters to Mr Potter with one from myself,

I have read the extracts from the Medical Mirror, and I quite feel with
you against circulating among the electors, from you or your friends, a
mere attack on Lowe.3 If one candidate puts forth a personal attack upon
another Edition: current; Page: [1353] (a thing it is seldom wise to do)
it should be a weightier, and better considered one than this. But if
any one in no way connected with your candidature chooses to circulate
it, I do not think you need concern yourself about the matter.

I shall always be ready to put in a timely word for competitive
examinations; but I do not know that the present is a particularly
favourable time for a motion in Parliament to extend them, and it is
still more uncertain whether I have not already quite as much on my
hands as I can manage.

Dear Mr Christie

The same post which brought your letter, brought the proof from the Law
Magazine.2 The article will do much good, and I wish it were circulated
widely among the liberal members of Parliament. It does not, however,
remove the few difficulties which your pamphlet had left in my mind. The
Chairmen of Election Committees have been less grossly partial since
they were a fixed body selected on the responsibility of the Speaker,
but they are still believed and expected to lean to their own party. The
corruption which was so flagrant as to cause the disfranchisement of
Yarmouth,3 did not make void the seats of the Conservative members, for
the Chairman of the Committee was a Conservative. At present what I
prefer is the plan you propose, of an investigation after every
election, parliamentary or municipal, by a special officer, with the
addition of an appeal from that officer to one of the Judges. It is
possible indeed, that to make the appeal be to a Committee of the House
with legal assessors, might facilitate the passing of the measure. But
it is our business to demand what is best, and not to propose a
splitting of the difference, though we may accept it if forced.

Edition: current; Page: [1354]
Unfortunately none of the Members you mention as specially interesting
themselves in this subject belong to the advanced Liberal section:
unless Pollard Urquhart may be so regarded, and he does not carry
weight. They may be made useful, but we shall need others. If you have
an opportunity, I think you should try to stir up M’Cullagh Torrens. I
mean to do so, but he should be attacked on more sides than one. He is
clever, and I have found him dependable upon for things requiring work.

With regard to your personal grievance,4 I sympathize sincerely and
heartily in your feelings respecting it, and it is painful to me to say
anything which may look like indifference to the subject. But I think
you will enter into the reasons which compelled me, on going into
Parliament, to lay down a rule not to take up personal cases. My sole
purpose in consenting to be elected, was to do what I could for my
opinions on questions of a purely public nature and on which there is no
one else in Parliament to speak: and for no object but this should I
have thought myself justified in giving up time which was already
usefully employed. Now it is quite impossible for me to give my time and
labour to the many public questions which have a claim on me, unless I
abstain from any other parliamentary business. To get up thoroughly a
subject like that of your conduct of the Brazil negociations, so as to
be invulnerable to criticism, and certain of not being unjust to any
one, would be enough to occupy me almost a whole session. It would not,
I think, be wise or right that I should postpone my own proper business
in Parliament, for the sake of which alone I am there, in order to do
what could be done as well by almost any member of parliament who would
take the pains, and by many much better than by me. But I shall be truly
glad if the subject is taken up in Parliament, and properly discussed
and canvassed so as to bring out all the truth.

Permettez-moi de vous exprimer mes sincères remerciments de l’accueil

arbres en réduisant la redevance annuelle à 21 fr.50.2

Edition: current; Page: [1355]
Il y a pourtant dans votre lettre un petit malentendu, que je dois
probablément attribuer à l’insuffisance de mes explications. La
concession primitive de 50 arbres ne s’arrêtait pas à la pierre
milliaire mais comprenait le premier arbre au delà en sorte que la
modification que vous m’avez accordie ne donnerait pas plus
qu’auparavant comme borne la pierre milliaire. Pour faire de cette
pierre la limite de la concession, ce que serait en effet fort commode,
il faudrait comme je l’indiquai dans ma lettre du 8 janvier, réduire le
nombre des arbres concédés à 42 au lieu de 43, ce qui entraînerait la
réduction de la redevance à 21 fr. par an. Il est vrai que je n’ai tiré
jusqu’ici aucun avantage de mon droit au dernier arbre, dont la ceppe a
été exploitée par le concessionaire voisin, par suite de l’incertitude
de la limite.

It would be a very good thing if you could get into Parliament for
Bristol even for the present session,2 but one of the great evils of the
present mode of election is that a local man is almost always the one
preferred unless some one else is willing to pay a great deal more
money. Even Radical Bradford elects a semi-Tory, because he is a local
man, in preference to Miall.3

I have written to Mr Gladstone expressing in strong terms my sense of
the importance of your being in Parliament, with the reasons of it, and
of the desirableness of your being on Mr Glyn’s list (Mr George Glyn,
the younger of the Glyns, is Mr Brand’s successor as whip).4 I do not
think Mr Gladstone is likely to take the suggestion amiss, and it will
at any rate place the matter before his mind.

Can I anywhere find a summary of your recommendations for a legislative
measure against corruption at elections? and if not, could you find time
to send me one? This subject is to come on, the very day of the

I much regret to hear of the state of your health. But I hope you are

sent me. It is very creditable as the first essay of a beginner, but I
believe it to have no chance of being accepted either by a bookseller or
by the editor of any paying periodical. Its opinions alone would exclude
it from almost every periodical which can afford to pay its
contributors. And the opinions & arguments are presented rather as they
would be written down for the writer’s own satisfaction, than in the
manner of one who is trying to convince or persuade others. I am very

It gave me very great pleasure to see your handwriting once more. But I
greatly regret that you should have had the causes of unhappiness to
which you allude & respecting which you hold out the hope that I shall
hear something from Mr Wessel.

I am truly glad that your labours on the System of Logic will now
produce Edition: current; Page: [1357] fruits.2 I am just now revising
the book for the seventh edition. There will not be many, nor very
important alterations; but I shall be happy to send you the sheets of
the new edition, with the alterations marked if it is possible for you
to receive them in time.

With respect to the Inaugural Address, I have given permission to a
young geologist, Dr Anton Dohrn,3 of Jena, to translate it into German,
& perhaps Mr Grosser would be good enough to communicate with him.

A Dr Sattler4 has just written to me from Madeira to propose translating
the essay on Comte. He refers to Gervinus5 as a voucher. I have referred
him to Mr Grosser.

Dr Wille’s translation of “Considerations on Representative Govt”6
seemed to me when I looked through the first pages of it, to need a good
deal of correction.

With respect to introductory matter I should prefer, on every account,
that anything of the sort should be written by you. It would be sure to
be both valuable in itself and much more fitted to explain and recommend
the series of Works to the German public, than anything I could write.

I am unable to give any opinion as to including the “Essays on Unsettled
Questions of P. E.” but if a new ed. of them were called for here I
should alter the first Essay considerably.7 It is probably prudent to
keep back the book on Hamilton for the present.

I have written a few lines to Mr Grosser8 in answer to his letter, &
have referred him for particulars to you.

I have to thank you for your publications of & respecting the
Herculanean MSS9 which are always very interesting to me.

I am glad to find that the letter I sent2 in answer to yours on the
question of Women’s suffrage is thought likely to have a useful
influence on the minds of those who read it, and I should be glad to see
it printed, as well as more from the same hand, but I should not like to
be a party to its being printed with my name, because it was written (as
is the case with no inconsiderable portion of my correspondence) by my
step-daughter Miss Helen Taylor. Without this help it would be
impossible for me to carry on so very voluminous a correspondence as I
am at present able to do: and we are so completely one in our opinions
and feelings, that it makes hardly any difference which of us puts them
into words. It is often with regret that I see attributed to myself work
which I think good and which is chiefly hers. In this case (by no means
a solitary one) it happened to be entirely hers; what she wrote
expressed so perfectly all I could have wished to say, that I
transcribed it unaltered. I am sure therefore that you will appreciate
the dislike I feel to consenting that it should be published or even
printed under my name. If everything said in a private letter is the
real opinion or feeling of the person who signs it, it is indifferent
whether it is written by him or for him, especially if it is as well
done as he could do it. But anything printed comes into the class of
literary performances, and I should feel (only in a less degree) as if I
were to publish a book written by my daughter with my own name instead
of hers prefixed to it.

TO JOHN VENN1

Feb. 4. 1868

Dear Sir

I am late in acknowledging the gift of your very valuable work “The
Logic of Chance.”2 As I perceived at once, as well as heard from others
who read it, that it well deserved consecutive study, for which pressing
occupations left me at the moment no leisure, I laid it by till the time
should come when I must necessarily take up the subject in revising my
System of Logic for another edition.3 This time has only recently
arrived, and I have availed myself of your criticisms to make several
alterations in the corresponding chapters of the book,4 which
alterations however are rather in the mode of expression than in the
substance of the opinions expressed.

I think your book very important, both as a contribution to the theory
of the subject, and as a corrective to prevalent errors. Your general
mode of viewing this class of questions is by far the best and most
philosophical I have met with; and while there is evidence of a great
agreement between us in our mode of regarding the great problems of
inductive philosophy, you have, on this particular subject, thrown light
upon many more points than space and time had allowed me to enter into.
Your book is one of the highest compliments which could have been paid
to mine; for I have scarcely met with any thinker who seems to have so
completely assimilated the best thoughts and principles of my book,
thereby affording strong indication that your own thoughts had flowed in
much the same direction, independently of any external suggestion.

There are, however, some points on which we differ, and on which your
book has not convinced me.5 For one thing, you seem to go farther in
rejecting Edition: current; Page: [1361] the doctrines of mathematicians
on the subject than even I do. If I understand you rightly, you attach
little value to the rule for determining the probability by which of
several causes a known event has been produced, which rule seems to me
to rest on solid grounds, and to be quite reconcileable with the
principle that all evaluation of probabilities must depend on
appropriate statistics. But our chief difference (not unconnected with
this last) consists in your not recognising what I regard as one of the
fundamental distinctions in philosophy, that between causal and
empirical laws.6 The root of this difference seems to be the opinion you
express that the entire sum of the circumstances which make up the
unconditionally invariable antecedent of any effect, is hardly ever
repeated. This seems to me, if I may be allowed to say so, a less
well-considered opinion than most of yours. If the exact combination of
antecedents that is connected with the effect, did not reappear, neither
would the effect itself ever reappear, except so far as it might be an
effect which had several independent modes of production.

If I had time to enter fully into the subject I should perhaps trouble
you with a detailed examination of the arguments in your chapter on
Causation.7 But, from the general evidence of your book, I shall be
surprised if you do not end by agreeing with me on this point, by the
progress of your own thoughts. On my side, I promise myself that when I
have more time to devote to the subject, I shall have still more to
learn from your book than I have yet learnt from it, and that at some
future time it may help me to expand and improve materially those parts
of my Logic.

Again thanking you for the pleasure and instruction you have given me, I
am

I shd be happy to support almost any feasible plan which would ensure

effecting this is strongly recommended by the close connexion of the
subject with the limitation of our coal supply, & plans similar to it
have sometimes been suggested. For my own part I am unable to see the
force of the strong objection which many public men entertain to any tax
on coals. As for the iron manufacturers, Mr Plimsoll has shewn in his
letters in the Times3 that the coal they waste amounts to as great a
quantity as their Belgian rivals consume altogether & it would do good
instead of harm to compel them by a tax to be more economical. No plan
for reducing the debt has a better claim to consideration than yours,
but until it has been more discussed it is impossible to come to a
positive opinion in favour of it.

of opinion between you & the majority of the Cee as to the mode in which
a struggle like that which they have undertaken, shd be carried on. This
is not like a contest for some political improvement, in which the only
question is whether it shall be obtained a little sooner or a little
later. Ours is, morally, a protest against a series of atrocious crimes,
& politically an assertion of the authority of the criminal law over
public delinquents. This protest & vindication must be made now or
never: & to relinquish the effort while a single unexhausted chance
remains would be, in my estimation, to make ourselves to some extent
participants in the crime. Suppose it to be certain that we shall fail
in bringing the criminal to justice, still there will be a portion of
the nation that will have held out to the last & refused to condone the
guilt, & it is better for the future that even one person should have
done this than that the national judgment shd go in favour of the
criminal with universal, at least passive acquiescence. You talk of
leaving Eyre to contempt. What he would be left to is boastful triumph,
followed by the fruits of victory in the shape of lucrative Government
employment, probably with power to do again what he has done, & with
undiminished if not increased disposition to do it. He has, after years
of skulking, come over & defied us3 doubtless for this express purpose,
& were we not to accept his challenge we shd be justly reproached for

My dear Lord

There are few persons whose complete adhesion to the opinions expressed
in my pamphlet2 could have given me more pleasure and encouragement than
yours. I am truly glad to find the deep sense I entertain of the
necessity of a radical change in the relations of the people of Ireland
to the soil and the formidable and growing danger of the attempts to
palter with the subject by measures which scarcely touch the evil,
confirmed by an equally strong conviction on your part. Though every day
shews more and more the incapacity of our governing classes to use their
minds to any purpose on the subject, there is a hopeful change taking
place in the minds of some other portions of the public; and if the
Reform Act, when it comes into operation, fulfils in other respects the
hopes that have been founded on it, we may hope that it will lead to a
less prejudiced consideration of the measures necessary for Ireland. If
not, I agree with you in thinking that the ultimate issue (after a
period of great suffering, crime, and national disaster) will be
separation.

I am my dear Lord
 very truly yours

Dear Mr Cairnes

I was disappointed that your letter did not report a further progress in
the improvement of your health. It is something, however, that your
letter is in your own handwriting, which it was a great pleasure again
to see.

I thank you for Mr Nesbitt’s paper,2 which I was very glad to have an
opportunity of reading. My opinion on the Education question is exactly
what it was, namely, entirely with you, up to the limits of
practicability. What either Disraeli or Gladstone intend or desire on
that subject will probably appear in the debate on the state of
Ireland,3 which has been, probably with set purpose, staved off till
next week by the adjournment of the House. The question is now getting
involved with that of the endowment or disendowment Edition: current;
Page: [1369] of the churches, and it is impossible to foresee what may
be proposed. But I fear that whatever is done, the change will be for
the worse.

I hope you received a pamphlet of mine on the land question,4 with the
practical conclusions of which I am afraid you will not agree. But all
the public signs, and all the authentic private information I have
access to, tend to shew that nothing short of what I propose would now
tranquillize Ireland, or reconcile the Irish people to the Union. And I
am sure that nothing less than some very startling proposal would have
any chance of whipping up the languid interest of English public men in
the subject, and making them feel the critical nature of the situation,
or exert their minds to understand it. On the whole I have met with more
approbation, and not more abuse, than I expected.

About our relations with the United States, there seems less cause of
uneasiness than there was some time ago. The principal newspapers on
both sides have grown, in comparison, conciliatory, and I do not despair
of a quiet settlement both of the Alabama claims5 and of the
naturalization question.6

Dear Mr. Christie,—

I am extremely glad that you intend to present yourself as a candidate
to the electors of the Stirling Burghs.2 The Scotch burghs have long
supplied the House with some of the best and most to be depended on of
the advanced Liberals, and I believe that you, if elected, would be
worthy of a place among the number. There would, moreover, be a peculiar
propriety in your return to Parliament by a constituency so free from
electoral corruption as those of Scotland have proved themselves to be;
since you have thought to greater purpose on the means of preventing
electoral corruption, and are likely to be of more service in passing
measures for that vitally important end than any other person whom I
could name. Your diplomatic experience, and your knowledge of the mode
in which our foreign affairs are conducted, would be of great value in
Parliament, acquired as that knowledge was in the course of an
honourable service, of the rewards of which you have been deprived for
no obvious reason but that an interested clamour was raised against some
parts of your official conduct,3 the authors of which, by general
admission, failed to make good any imputation against you, unless it be
an imputation to have made yourself disagreeable to those who were
endeavouring to evade the fulfilment of their national obligations.—I
am, dear Mr. Christie, very truly yours,

post. You will not find in it much argument, of a nature to remove any
Edition: current; Page: [1373] difficulties which you are likely to
feel. The object was to strike hard, and compel people to listen to the
largest possible proposal. This has been accomplished, and now the time
is come for discussing in detail the manner in which the plan, if
adopted, would work. I do not share your hopes that anything much short
of what I have proposed, would give peace or prosperity to Ireland in
union with England: but if there is any intermediate course which would
do so, its adoption is likely to be very much promoted by frightening
the Government and the landlords with something more revolutionary; as
even the Saturday Review admits.3

The great Irish debate begins tonight,4 and in the course of it I shall
probably have an opportunity of answering the practical objections to my
proposal.

March 11, 1868

Dear Madam

I must beg of you to excuse my addressing you, which I do on account of
the very great interest I take in the matter on which I write, and the
earnest desire I feel that you may accede to the request I am
commissioned to make to you.

I believe you have already heard that a Society was formed last year for
endeavouring to extend the franchise to women,2 and in this Society I
take a warm interest, and have been glad to see many of my friends join
it.

Looking upon your own justly honoured name as the one which, before all
others, the Society would be proud to include among its members, I was
much gratified when, some months ago, I heard that you had consented to
join it. But I am now informed by Mrs Taylor,3 the Secretary of the
Society (to whose disinterested zeal and energy we are all much
indebted) that on Edition: current; Page: [1374] enquiring of Miss
Cobbe, from whom she received the notification of your willingness to
join us, whether she should put down your name and those of your
daughters as members of the General Committee, or as members of the
Society, she finds some uncertainty on this matter, and that Miss Cobbe
hesitates to say more than that she is certain of your “approval.” In
this uncertainty, I am commissioned by Mrs Taylor to express to you her
deep regret if unwittingly your name has been made use of without your
own full sanction; and at the same time, to beg of you to permit your
name and those of Miss Somerville and Miss M. Somerville4 to be placed
on the General Committee. I greatly regret if there has been any
misunderstanding, but Mrs Taylor tells me that she was under the
impression that you had received copies of the Circular of the Society,
and had given your consent to become a member after having seen them:
and it is only when printing a list of the subscribers that she finds
her friend unwilling to define in which list your name is to be
inserted, though quite certain of your approval of the aims of the
Society.

You will see by the papers I inclose, that the Society consists, besides
the Executive Committee: Firstly, of a General Committee, consisting of
annual subscribers of one guinea, who are not responsible for the
management; who, in giving their names, are considered to give in an
adhesion only to the specific object of the Society, the extension of
the franchise to women. Secondly, of ordinary members, consisting of all
subscribers of one shilling or upwards, less than one guinea. Some of
our most valued members belong to this latter portion, and I beg that
you will allow your name to be included in one of the two: certain as I
am that in doing so you will give the weight and dignity of the living
name to which English-women justly look up with the greatest pride, to
help a movement better calculated than any other to enable women in
general to attain a position more worthy of them than that which they
now hold, and one better fitted to make them of use to the world.

I am Dear Madam with the greatest respect

It is a worthy act on the part of the New England Loyal Publication
Society,2 to resume its operations for the purpose of contending against
the Edition: current; Page: [1376] deplorable doctrines now afloat in
the United States about currency and the obligation of contracts. A
breach of faith with the national creditor by the people of the United
States, under whatever disguise, would be, in my estimation, the most
unfortunate event for the morality of the world, and for the reputation
and progress of free institutions, which at the present time could
possibly happen; and of all modes of defrauding the public creditor,
that of cancelling the debt by handing over to him a vast quantity of
paper depreciated to worthlessness by excessive issue, would be, in its
practical operation, the worst. If, as you do me the honour of thinking,
anything that I could write on the subject could in the smallest degree
aid your exertions to ward off this calamity from your country and from
mankind, I should feel bound in duty to what little I can for the
purpose. Unfortunately, it is impossible for me to write anything
requiring care and concentration of thought during the session of

I thank you very sincerely for your further remarks in illustration of
the matters treated in your book. I shall keep them by me for a fuller
and more deliberate consideration than it is in my power to give them
during the session of Parliament. I will merely, at present, say a few
words on a single point; the flaw which seems to you to exist in the
theory of the predictability of human history, from the influence which
the foresight itself may have in modifying the facts foreseen.2 This
influence is real, but does not seem to me to affect the theory; for the
self-consciousness of mankind, and their foresight of their own future,
is itself a foreseeable and calculable element. It Edition: current;
Page: [1377] might have been predicted by a superior being that at such
and such an epoch in the development of the human mind, mankind would
begin to perceive the law of their own future, and that their perception
would modify the future in such and such a way.

There is an inconsistency though only a verbal one, between the two
passages which you cite3 from my Political Economy.

Your examination papers in Political Economy are very thorough and
searching.

You are most welcome to use any part of my letter4 as a testimonial,
provided it is so used as to shew that it was not written with a view to

TO FLORENCE MAY1

[after
March 22, 1868

]

Dear Madam—

I am much interested by the observations in your letter & by the
evidence it affords of how very deeply you feel the consequences of the
subordination of women although you have not been in the habit of
tracing them to their cause. Women of every age & of every position in
life with very few exceptions suffer from some one or other of the evils
that are the natural results of political subordination. There are some
few women who can scarcely be said to suffer personally from these
evils, & who are even so fortunate that their intellect itself is freed
by happy accident from the numbing effects of the education & position
of women. But that indignation & fervent desire of redress which these
few do not feel on their own account, they will be likely to feel all
the more deeply for the sake of others; and suffering themselves from no
one particular grievance, may be perhaps the Edition: current; Page:
[1378] better qualified to see what is the common root of the many
grievances from which others are suffering.

Those two which you particularly mention, the want of education & the
want of a career,2 are probably those most deeply & pressingly felt at
present in our own country among educated women of the class of ladies.
And although I think it would be easy to trace the still more sad &
bitter sufferings of married women & women among the poor to a political
cause, still these two are among the evils which are most evidently the
consequence of political defranchisement [. . . ?] would be most
speedily & easily removed by opening the suffrage to women.

How very quickly public attention to the education of a class follows
upon opening the franchise to that class we have all of us seen within
the last year in the sudden & universal interest in the education of the
poor which has followed upon our new Reform Bill. It is not going too
far to say that six months have done more with the aid of the Reform
Bill to ripen public opinion in the matter of popular education than 20
years with the aid of all the most enlightened thinkers & writers among
us. On the other side we see how very little extensive endowments will
do if those for whose benefit they have been made have not the power of
insuring their application; since there is scarcely one if one of all
the educational endowments in the country, most of which were originally
made for poor boys & girls, which have not been long ago appropriated to
the boys of those classes which possess political influence. And I am
persuaded that if women in this country urged by a strong feeling of the
importance of the education of women to found magnificent institutions
for that object, and to train women without any votes, a century or two
hence would see them all silently lapsed into the hands of those who
possess by the vote the power of attending to their own interests. It is
not by accident that this has happened hitherto with all our endowments,
nor is it by any extraordinary perversity or wickedness. It is by the
steady & invariable pressure of self interest in all human affairs, for
make what regulations you will, somebody must enforce them; they will
not enforce themselves; & those among the persons affected who have the
power to enforce them will be active in enforcing what concerns
themselves, & will by Edition: current; Page: [1379] mere forgetfulness
& negligence, if from nothing worse, let what does not, lapse into the
oblivion & neglect which have been the fate of the regulations
concerning the poorer scholars in almost all our magnificent endowments
for education. Give to women a vote & it will be worth while to educate
them, as it is now thought worth while to educate the working classes.
Give to women a vote & they will begin to ask what has become of the
funds for the education of girls in our existing endowments & when a
voter asks a candidate a question, the question will not be pooh poohed
as feminine talk. Give to women a vote, & new institutions arising from
the new sense of the importance of women in the world will not be turned
aside from the objects for which they were intended.

The closing of all careers to women is still more obviously the
consequence of their political insignificance. A lady who takes much
interest in this subject3 has taken some pains to point out the many
ways in which the mere fact of having no vote causes women applicants
for employment to be passed over. The daughters & widows of farmers have
the greatest difficulty in inducing, & only can induce a few
philanthropic landlords to permit them to retain the farms of their
fathers & husbands because a woman has no vote & the landlord likes all
his tenants to vote for his own candidates. Postmistresses & other
little functionaries are disappearing to the level at which voters begin
because all these little places are given through the influence of
members of Parlt, who naturally give them to voters. In France some
years ago many hundred women were employed as clerks in telegraph
offices; since the lowering of the suffrage in that country to all the
men, no fresh women clerks have been appointed. I need scarcely point
out to you how all these things throw hundreds of women upon such few
means of earning their bread as men cannot keep for themselves, & make
the pressure of competition greater & the chance of success less even in
these few. But it is evident that these same principles are at work in
all those departments of life which might furnish what may properly be
called a career as distinguished from a mere living. Parliament decides
the rules by which entry into all professions is governed & a parlt
consisting of men elected by men only, either expressly excludes women
or more often leaves the drawing up of those rules to a body of
professional men who shut out women with all the jealousy of rivals.
Thus it is that the medical profession threatens to be closed against
women as well as all public employments.

But I feel sure that as you come to reflect on these subjects you will
be peculiarly able to see the working of several principles, & I will do
myself the pleasure of forwarding some of the papers & publications of
the Society for Women’s Suffrage.

subject of the two or three most important of your suggestions
respecting a bribery bill. I think my doing so has done some good. There
seems so much difficulty in bringing the various MP’s who have been

without reference to any meeting, and have therefore given notice of an
amendment for the prohibition of paid canvassers, and have suggested
several other amendments which I am endeavouring to induce suitable
members to move. I am told that I may expect a good deal of support even
from Tories on the subject of paid canvassers.

members, from various places, great and small; but there will be one,
promoted by the London Branch of the Society, to be presented by myself
in May signed both by women and men which far exceeds in number of
signatures all hitherto presented.3 It has already nearly 14000
signatures, many of them names of great weight, and many more are
expected. Now it would not only be felt a great honour by the promoters,
but would also be of great value to the cause, if you would allow the
first signature to this petition to bear your name.4

will, in that case, be the first sheet of the voluminous document, and I
beg you to return it to me at the address which heads this letter. I am

Dear Sir

Your letter dated March 16 was like all your letters, very interesting
to me. It is a real pleasure to receive them.

I do not happen to have in my possession spare copies of any of the
books in your list but I have little doubt of being able to procure some
of them. Milton’s Prose Works however are not easy to be met with. Some
of the books you mention are French: is it translations that you wish
for, or have you been enabled to learn to read French books in the
original?

The Mr De Morgan2 who died lately is, I am sorry to say, a son of the
eminent mathematician with whom you have corresponded.

I inclose a petition3 which is in course of signature, and as I know you
agree with its sentiments, should be glad if you would sign it or get it
signed by men or women who agree with it and send it back to me. It has
already been signed by 14,000 persons, and it is found that working
women are very often willing to sign it. I am Dear Sir

Dear Mr Christie

Many thanks for your very valuable cautions. I shall not finally draw up
my clauses until I receive your further suggestions. It is only too
clear that we have plenty of time.

Mr Disraeli’s answer to my question was civil but in no degree
satisfactory.2 In fact the enquiring into municipal corruption in any
effectual manner Edition: current; Page: [1384] seems to depend on the
creation of the permanent officers proposed by you which is inconsistent
with the general plan of his Bill. I am afraid this main principle of
your plan will have to wait for the rejection of the Government Bill, or
for the failure of it in practice if adopted. Perhaps you can suggest
some mode of bringing it before the House by way of amendment. I am
quite ready to do so if you think it expedient.

Mr Hibbert,3 who is rather clever as well as careful in framing
amendments will probably propose at least one amendment carrying out one
of your proposals. Mr Fawcett is willing, if wanted, to propose other
amendments besides those of which he has given notice,4 & I have other
members in view. So that, among us, we have the subject well in hand and
shall be able to force on a series of discussions.

Dear Madam

I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 23rd ult. I beg
to express not only my earnest wishes, but my confident hopes for the
success of the efforts which the American Association for Equal Rights
is carrying on to obtain the full rights of citizenship for every
subject of the United States, and especially for that moiety of the
nation who, though the imaginary disqualification of difference of race
and blood cannot be alleged in their case, are denied a voice in those
public interests which concern them in the same manner and in the same
degree as the other moiety. In this country the political
enfranchisement of women is gaining ground rapidly in public opinion,
and if the cause is thus prospering in the old country, which has never
yet professed to ground its political institutions on principles of
equal justice, but chiefly on historical precedent, how much more ought
it to prosper in the United States, the very foundation of whose
institutions is the equality of all human beings in the eye of the law
and of the constitution, and who proclaimed that great devotion in the
memorable document by which they first attested their existence as a
nation. There is no true democracy where large classes of the community
are denied equality of political rights. Every Government which
permanently divides its people into a governing part and a governed part
is an aristocratic Government, by whatever name it may be called, and I
am convinced that the people of the United States of both political
parties are capable of seeing this, and, attached as they both are to
the general principles of democratic government, only need a persevering
appeal to their reason and good feelings to induce them to free their
constitution from the remains of the old system of privileged Edition:

I shall certainly oppose the attempt to reduce the four Scottish

Scotland owes much more to her universities than either England or
Ireland to theirs, and they have been far greater diffusers of a Liberal
education. To treat the people’s universities so much worse than the
universities of the higher ranks is quite according to custom, but ought
to be resisted to the utmost.

Dear Mr Christie—

The Bribery Bill2 stands for Thursday, after the Budget; and as the
Budget is not likely to afford much matter for discussion, it may leave
time for beginning the passage of the Bribery Bill through Committee.
This, however, it will be hardly possible to know till the time comes. I
will endeavour to learn what the Government intend or expect, but I do
not believe they will be willing, or probably able, to tell me. Unless
they do, I can hardly avoid putting my clauses on the paper before
Thursday. But they can be altered or enlarged afterwards, a thing
continually done.

I should be sorry if I thought we really differed about extradition
treaties.3 I am quite in favour of extradition of real criminals, but I
hold strongly the necessity of so defining the crimes for which it can
be demanded, that offences really political may not be included, under
cover of the names of ordinary crimes: e.g. Louis Napoleon’s shooting
the sentinel at Boulogne under the crime of murder.4 I would adopt a
proviso to except cases in which the offence formed part of an armed
insurrection, or of an attempt to excite an armed insurrection for the
purpose of effecting changes in the government. The preliminary enquiry
previous to extradition must of course go fully into this question. I am

Dear Sir—

It is a very difficult thing to find a person competent to edit Hume’s
Philosophical Works2 as the editor ought to be highly instructed both in
the deepest philosophical speculations & in their history & capable
besides of original thinking & writing of a high order of philosophy.
This applies even to the Essays, apart from the Treatise on Human
Nature. But, with a little more time to think about it I may be able to
suggest some one who could perform the work at least not discreditably.

I am much obliged by your answer to my question about my father’s
copyrights. The “Elements of Political Economy” were first published at
the end of 1821 or beginning of 1822: the third edition, (considerably
altered & enlarged) came out in 1826. The “Analysis” was published in
1829 & the “Fragment on Mackintosh” in 1835.

Can there be any unauthorized publication of selections from my
writings, to which the order you have received has reference? or what
can be the nature of the misunderstanding?

I have had an application, which will probably be made to you, for
permission to reprint some chapters or parts of chapters of the P. of P.
Econ to be used in Victoria against the Protectionists. I have answered
that I myself shd be very happy, but it cannot be done without your

Dear Sir—

I beg to acknowledge your letter of the 14th inst.

Your purpose of endeavouring to improve the popular discussion of the
remedies for poverty, by substituting reason & science for vague
declamation, is most laudable & commands my strongest sympathy. You will
render a great service by diverting the attention of thinkers & of the
working classes to the close connexion between the rate of wages & the
ratio of population to the means of subsistence & employment. At the
same time you doubtless agree with me in thinking that this is only one
of several causes which conspire to determine the good or bad material
condition of the labourer. It would not be a correct view of my opinions
to suppose that I think everything wrong in the doctrines of Socialism;
on the contrary I think that there are many elements of truth in them, &
that much good may be done in that direction, especially by the progress
of the Cooperative movement, now so successfully commenced in most of
the leading countries of Europe. Since you do me the honour to be a
reader of my writings, I may be permitted to refer you, on this subject,
to the chapter of my “Principles of P.E.” entitled “The Probable Future
of the Labouring Classes,” which expresses in a sufficiently distinct
manner the position I take up with regard to this class of questions.

Dear Sir—

I beg to acknowledge your letter of the 20th inst. & its inclosures.

Even labourers who have the means of saving from their wages, (which
cannot be said of the first person mentioned in your letter) must if
they Edition: current; Page: [1390] have not done so, be relieved at
times of temporary inability to work; but there ought to be legal means
of recovering the amount from their wages as soon as they are again able
to earn. By the poor law of 1834 power was I believe, given to guardians
to grant temporary loans to persons in distress: certainly this power
was given in the original bill & I am not aware of its having been
struck out though I am surprised at never having heard of its being
used.

I do not think it beyond the competence of a government to compel all
its subjects to insure against the various evils of life—which is the
principle of your proposed National Friendly Society. But I think it
much better simply to afford them facilities for doing so without
employing compulsion, and I do not believe that a compulsory measure
would be carried unless long & thorough previous discussion had led the
working classes themselves to demand it. Neither, I think, would it ever
be felt to be just to take compulsory measures against the improvidence
of the labouring classes, leaving that of all other classes free.

My dear Mr Gomperz—

Many thanks for your letter. All that you have done and are doing in
respect to the edition of my writings2 seems to me highly judicious. I
am most happy in accepting Mr Wessel’s offer to translate the
Dissertations & Discussions & to retranslate the Representative Govt.3
It is a rare good fortune to find a translator with such a union of
eminent qualifications certified by such a witness as you. And it is the
greater satisfaction to me on account of his intimacy with yourself, &
of the sincere esteem which I conceived for him personally during the
short period of our intercourse.

In the case of Dr Sattler4 I hope I did not omit to mention that I know
nothing of his qualifications except that he referred to Gervinus as an
authority for them. I am therefore very glad that you intend to make
corrections if they shd be needed. I hope Dr Soetbeer has brought up his
translation of the Pol. Econ.5 to the latest edition.

With respect to the Inaugural Address assuming that Dr Dohrn6 who holds
my written authority for translating it, waives that authority, I gladly
place it at your discretion as well as the “Utilitarianism” & I inclose
on a separate piece of paper an authority for the translation by any
person whom you select. With regard to the passage you mention in the
Utilitarianism7 I have not had time regularly to rewrite the book, & it
had escaped my memory that you thought that argument apparently though
not really fallacious which proves to me the necessity of, at least,
further explanation & development. I beg that in the translation you
will kindly reserve that passage to yourself, & will remove the
stumbling block, by expressing the real argument in such terms as you
think will express it best.

I am very curious to know your answer to Mr Grote’s arguments about the
Platonic Canon & I hope you will have time to write it out & communicate
Edition: current; Page: [1392] it to himself.8 I am certain of being
very much interested by your researches on the state of Egypt under the
Ptolemies as I was by your “Traumdeutung und Zauberei.”9 I learnt with
great pleasure from Mr Wessel the favourable reception of your labours,
the growth of your reputation & the prospect of your obtaining increased
means of usefulness by being appointed to a Professorship, to which in
the present state of opinion you cannot long remain ineligible while I
most truly sympathize with you on the heavy blows which have fallen on
your family10 & especially on the lady to whom we had so much pleasure
in being introduced at Vienna in 1862. She has indeed suffered two of
the greatest calamities with which human life, full of suffering as it
is, can strike anyone & we can only hope that one of these calamities
may not be lasting & irreparable, as unhappily the other is.

I inclose a few lines to Mr Wessel. With kindest regards,

ever yours truly

a National Friendly Society?2 I am glad that you do not propose making

Dear Sir

From the interest you took in the Reader, and again last year in another
proposal for founding a weekly paper,2 I infer that you agree with me in
thinking that some good might be done by a thoroughly liberal well
written paper. I have now been applied to by Mr Boyd Kinnear, who is
very earnestly desirous of establishing something of the sort, a
prospectus of which I inclose. He tells me that although the
contributions, being signed by the writers, will be allowed considerable
latitude in the expression of opinion, and place is to be given in
“Correspondence” for opinions contrary to those of the paper, yet the
general tendency of the paper is “not to be extreme—only pretty much
mine (J. S. Mill) in politics and philosophy.” It is with some surprise
that I hear I am a model moderate man, but I have no objection to accept
the position, if all my opinions are to be accepted as moderate too.
From what I see it appears to me that Mr Boyd Kinnear and his proposed
associates Edition: current; Page: [1395] have much more definite ideas
on politics than on any of the other topics that interest us; and I have
told them that I think the paper, to be successful either among thinking
working men or really liberal thinkers in any class, must include good
writing with advanced opinions on science and philosophy. He demurred a
little at first to this, apparently disliking to give up much space to
anything but politics, because he proposes that the paper should be
small, about half the size of the Saturday Review, with good print and
paper, and costing only a penny. He seems to propose the pay of
contributors to average about £2 a page. He has got a considerable staff
of young men—such as those who wrote the two volumes of Essays on Reform
last year3—to whom he looks for regular contributions. But he wishes to
have articles from writers of high standing, one or two every week, and
to be able to give their names as regular contributors. He proposes to
be editor himself, but does not make a point of this: but I should
prefer his being so, because I think it would ensure the thing not being
carried on merely as a money speculation. I have recommended to him to
apply to yourself and Mr Huxley and Sir John Lubbock, and he has asked
me to do so. Do you think the plan promises well, and that you yourself,
and those of your friends who were thinking of some such scheme last
year, would be disposed to amalgamate with Mr Boyd Kinnear? For myself,
I will do my best, which is not very much, to help the scheme, if I can
see persons like yourself connected with it, who are likely to keep it
in a good school in philosophical matters: but I do not feel inclined to
do so if it is likely to be, like some of the daily papers, pretty good
in politics, but altogether gone-by in other matters. Among the persons
Mr Boyd Kinnear has mentioned to me as having promised to write are Mr
Roundell,4 the two Trollopes,5 Dean Alford (!)6 Lord Amberley, Baynes
and Masson.

The writer of the article signed L.2 is as profoundly ignorant of
everything that belongs to his subject, as it is possible for a person
who reads newspapers and can write English to be. Being the dupe of all
the most exploded nonsense of the old Mercantile System, he is not one
of those who can have been misled by the passage he quotes from my book
or who could be influenced by any further disclaimer on my part of the
conclusions drawn from it. One of the curious absurdities in his letter
is, that he says he wants protection only for articles which can be
produced cheaper than they can be imported, that is, only for things
which do not need protection. It is a bad sign of the political
backwardness of New South Wales if arguments like his need answering;
but, as it appears they do, I applaud your intention of refuting him.

I am very glad you find the parliamentary papers useful. It will be very

Dear Mr. Christie,

I thank you much for the two numbers of the Pall Mall Gazette,2 which I
will keep for the present and return to you. The latter of them I had
seen.

I find by the annual return of expiring acts of Parliament, that the
Corrupt Practices Prevention Act (1854) expires this very summer. Does
this circumstance affect any of our amendments?3

I found it would be entirely useless to suggest the abandonment of the
Boundary Bill.4

Dear Mr Christie

The “Register of Temporary laws now in force” just distributed states
the duration of the 26 & 27 Vict. c. 29 to be until the 8th June 1868
and the Edition: current; Page: [1400] “end of the next session”; which
I understand to mean the session (if any) then pending.

I yesterday put on the paper Serjeant Pulling’s clauses2 providing for a
scrutiny of all elections before the return of the writ, and extending
that scrutiny to municipal elections, and likewise two of your clauses
(but by some mistake the clerk has omitted one) allowing Election
Committees to inquire into corruption committed at municipal elections
within the two years previous. After consideration I thought this better
than moving an instruction to the Committee. It brings the subject in a
practical way before the consideration of members, which is all we can
hope to do this year on a proposal which deviates so far from the system
of the Government Bill. Next year we must have a Bill of our own, drawn
up on your principles. These particular amendments will serve this year
as a peg for discussion, but our previous efforts had better, I think,
be reserved for the anti-canvassing clauses, which there is no
likelihood of arriving at tomorrow, and on which I shall be very happy
to receive your further suggestions. I am

Monsieur

J’ose espérer que vous voudrez bien ne pas trouver déplacée la liberté
que je prends en vous recommandant le nom de mon ami M. Chadwick pour le
fauteuil d’Associé Étranger à l’Académie des [sciences morales et] Pol.
vacant par la mort de Lord Brougham.2 Vous n’ignorez pas les rares
qualités de M. Chadwick, & les services importants qu’il ne cesse de
rendre à quelques-uns des intérêts les plus importants et jusqu’à lui
les plus négligés de l’humanité.

On peut dire avec vérité que sa vie est consacrée au progrès de
l’administration publique, et qu’il apporte à presque toutes les
branches de cette étude si négligée parmi nous, des pensées aussi
vraies, et fécondes qu’originales. Lié avec lui depuis le commencement
de sa carrière publique, je sais mieux que personne l’ardeur
désintéressée qui l’a de tout temps caractérisé et le rôle qu’il a joué
dans la préparation de tous les importants progrès administratifs qui se
sont réalisés de nos temps en Angleterre, sans parler de ceux encore
plus nombreux qui restent encore à réaliser. Vous savez M[onsieur] les
contributions que M. Chadwick a faites aux travaux de l’Académie3 depuis
qu’il a l’honneur d’en être un des correspondants,4 contributions qui
seraient déjà un titre à l’honneur encore plus grand auquel il Edition:
current; Page: [1402] aspire actuellement. Si l’Académie le jugeait
digne d’une marque si éclatante de son estime, pour lui cette haute
appréciation de la part d’un corps si illustre ne pourrait manquer
d’accroître encore la considération dont il jouait déjà, parmi ses
compatriotes les plus éclairés, et par là d’augmenter ses moyens de
rendre service à son pays et au monde, à quoi il tient beaucoup plus
qu’à toute distinction personnelle quelque honorable qu’elle soit.

Il me serait difficile d’exprimer combien je me sens reconnaissant de
votre lettre. Je vous avoue qu’ordinairement je suis très indifférent
aux honneurs et dignités de toute espèce. Mais je suis déjà fier du
titre de Correspondant de l’Académie,2 et je le serais encore plus de
l’honneur que vous et vos amis m’avez destiné,3 et cela pour une
excellente raison, puisque cet honneur aurait été conféré par des hommes
que je respecte [et] s’il n’y avait aucune chance pour mon ami M.
Chadwick, je regrettrais d’avoir perdu l’honneur d’être même proposé par
la partie de l’Académie qui selon moi consiste des hommes les plus
distingués. Mais s’il y a quelque chance pour mon ami je préférais de
lui céder la place. M. Chadwick est un homme très désintéressé et pas
assez apprécié, et cet honneur en ajoutant à son influence serait encore
une récompense pour ses travaux, la dignité d’associé de l’Académie
étant comme de raison, très hautement appréciée chez nous. Ce serait
donc pour moi un grand plaisir que de la voir obtenir par M. Chadwick,
et aussi d’avoir été pour quelque chose là dedans. Et il me serait de
l’autre côté très pénible d’être moi-même l’obstacle même apparent à son
succès.

Sachant d’ailleurs que mes opinions philosophiques sont mal reçues par
une grande partie de l’Académie j’ai cru que peut-être M. Chadwick
pourrait obtenir beaucoup de suffrages qui ne me seraient pas donnés, et
qu’en ajoutant à ceux-là les suffrages que j’aurais pu obtenir, il
aurait d’excellentes chances de réussir. Permettez-moi de vous remercier
de tout mon coeur de l’extrème bonté que vous montrez pour moi. Il n’y a
que peu de personnes dont l’estime me serait aussi précieuse.
Pardonnez-moi aussi que je ne réponds pas d’une manière plus [illegible
word] à votre lettre. Je crois de vous avoir suffisamment exprimé le
mélange de sentiments que j’éprouve.

Dear Mr Christie

You will have seen the debate on the first amendment,2 which however is
a good deal abridged in the report. The minority of 74 is not
discouraging, as Whitbread,3 Melly,4 and (I believe) many others who
voted against the amendment will vote for it when it is moved in a
separate clause. The bill cannot well be brought on again before next
Thursday, and in the meantime if you would draw up a clause embodying
the purpose of the rejected amendment, I will put it on the paper. I ask
you to take this trouble because you would do it much better than I can
myself.

I send you the full list of amendments as it now stands. I have never
had a spare copy before. Hibbert’s5 is not yet among them, but he
intends to give it in. I shall this evening substitute the clauses you
last sent (with one or two slight verbal changes) for my original notice
on the subject of paid canvassers.

Dear Mr Christie

I propose to bring up the new clause in Committee. As the new clauses
are not discussed until after the bill has been gone through, we are
still a long way from them.

It is probable however that the Government will bring up a new clause
Edition: current; Page: [1404] providing for an easier and prompter
enquiry into complaints of general corruption. But they object to having
this done by their tribunal, viz. the Judges. There can be no similar
objection to its being done by our tribunal: and the reason why we
cannot come to an agreement with them, is that our plan fits into our
general system, but does not fit into theirs.

Many voted against the amendment for the reason which you mention in the
case of Grant Duff: some of them moved by the fact that Ayrton2 (who,
they think, wants to defeat the Bill) supported the amendment. But
Ayrton means to propose an amendment of his own, for the same general
purpose as your and Serjeant Pulling’s plans, though differing from them
in its machinery.

Bain promises to do all he can for your candidature.3 I will take the

Many thanks for your valuable suggestion.2 There will probably be an

the Edition: current; Page: [1405] name of Lamont3 means to move a
resolution that Eyre’s expenses ought to be borne by the public.

It would be difficult to find any one less likely to be discomposed by
the abuse heaped upon him than myself, or, I believe, than Taylor.4 The
worst of all this is the indication which it gives of the spirit of our
higher classes & of a considerable portion of the public.

A propos, I receive abusive letters, at the rate of three or four a

They are all anonymous, and as ineffably stupid as one might expect.

Dear Mr Cairnes

Before receiving your most welcome letter, I had seen the Queen’s
University delegates (of whom Professor Nesbitt was not one) and had
promised them all the help I could give to their application for a
representative in Parliament.2

Fawcett has put off his motion from tonight to this day fortnight,3
there Edition: current; Page: [1406] being no hope of a good discussion
when people were eager to get away for the holidays. McKenna, the Tory
Irishman,4 has given notice of an amendment which would turn the debate
into one between the Catholic project and Fawcett’s; a thing which
Monsell5 was anxious to avoid. But this issue must be faced if need be.
A greater practical difficulty is this: As both Monsell and Pim6 remark,
the parallel case to Maynooth7 is not the Irish Church, but Trinity
College: and there will not be complete religious equality if Maynooth
is abolished, and any Divinity School at all kept up for the Anglican
Church, however Trinity College may be freed from denominationalism in
every other respect. Now it is doubtful if the public are yet prepared
to support a proposal for abolishing the Divinity School altogether at
Trinity College, any more than at Oxford and Cambridge: and they
certainly would refuse to admit a Catholic Divinity School by the side
of it.

You will have heard of, if not seen Provost Lloyd’s pamphlet.8 The
movement in Trinity College itself against his proposal and in favour of
Fawcett’s is very auspicious.

I am glad you at last got my pamphlet.9 Bright’s land plan10 would, like
any plan for creating a class of peasant proprietors in Ireland, do a
certain quantity of good: but I do not believe it would get over the
main difficulty since it would give no security to the actual tenantry
of Ireland.

Laveleye has sent me his book on Holland11 for the sake of an
interesting account it contains of a system of landlords with tenants
under them at a fixed rent, which obtains in the province of Groningen.
It appears to work well there; but the recent rise of general prices is
now enabling the tenants to sublet at a profit to tenants who will not
enjoy the same advantages. This is provided against in my plan.

The cause of women is indeed making progress, and is now, probably, past
all danger of retrogression.

Dear Sir

I have read your speech on the Land question2 with great interest. I
have no doubt that you are right in endeavouring to prevent the sale of
the public lands to mere speculators who buy to resell at a profit: but
it seems to me that the land in the hands of its actual cultivators is a
perfectly legitimate source of revenues. I often think that it would be
much better if a new country retained all its lands as state property,
giving, as we do in India, leases renewable for ever at rents guaranteed
against any augmentation except by a general measure. But perhaps jacta
est alea, and the people of the United States would not take land except
on the same terms of absolute property on which it has been hitherto
acquired. According to my own notions, absolute property in land, even
when owned by the cultivators, is a prejudice and an abuse. I am

Dear Sir—

I regret deeply that any one who has ever done me the honour to vote for
me can disapprove of the course I thought it my duty to take in regard
to Mr Eyre’s proceedings in Jamaica,2 because I have never in the whole
course of my life felt myself called upon to take practical action on
any matter on which I felt more clear as to the course indicated by the
principles which I hold & have always endeavoured to promulgate. In
regard to Mr Eyre personally my feelings towards him, so far as I can be
said to have had any, before I knew of his conduct in Jamaica, were
favourable, inasmuch as I knew of him only as a traveller whose
narrative I had read with interest.3 Neither has anything ever occurred
directly or indirectly in the whole course of my life to arouse the
smallest personal feeling of any sort in me towards Mr Eyre as a private
man. But I cannot say that it is possible to me as a man to regard Mr
Eyre’s conduct in Jamaica without the deepest indignation, or as an
Englishman without a sentiment of humiliation: nor can I pretend that I
can regard without abhorrence & contempt the man who knowing himself to
be guilty in the eyes of many disinterested persons, of the wanton
torture & death of many hundred men & women, can be content to shelter
himself under any shield whatever Edition: current; Page: [1411] against
a judicial examination & does not eagerly challenge and earnestly invite
the closest possible scrutiny into whatever justification he thinks he
can urge. To me it appears that the conduct of Mr Eyre since his return
to England shews a callousness to human suffering & a contempt for his
fellow men which alone go far to shew his total unfitness for any
station of authority over them.

Yet if all human sympathies could be cast aside altogether, the
importance of instituting a judicial enquiry into the proceedings in
Jamaica would still be paramount in the eyes of all thinking persons who
look upon law & justice as the foundation of order & civilisation. If
the majority of any nation were willing to allow such events to pass
unquestioned I have no hesitation in saying that all the ties of civil
society would in that nation be at the mercy of accident. There would be
no principle in the minds of men to bind civilized society together.
Happily I am fully convinced that the great majority of the English
nation does desire judicial enquiry into these events. Were I not so
convinced I shd be ashamed of my country. Nevertheless even if I were
not convinced of this I shd think it my duty to express in the clearest,
the most public & the most practical way in my power my opinion of the
importance of checking the lawlessness of which Mr Eyre’s conduct in
Jamaica appears to my humble judgment a flagrant example. I believe from
a perfectly calm & disinterested examination of the subject that Mr Eyre
has either been guilty of, or has tolerated under his authority, crimes
of violence & cruelty which no man of even ordinarily tender conscience
or good heart could be capable of. The detestation of the right judging
among his fellow creatures might however in some circumstances be a
sufficient punishment for this. At all events, while the world is as
full of crime as it is, I do not suppose that however strong my feelings
about it, I shd have considered myself as peculiarly called upon to
interfere against him. But I do consider myself as an Englishman called
upon to protest against what I believe to be an infringement of the laws
of England; against acts of violence committed by Englishmen in
authority, calculated to lower the character of England in the eyes of
all foreign lovers of liberty; against a precedent that could justly
inflame against us the people of our dependencies; & against an example
calculated to brutalize our own fellow countrymen. Nor would any amount
of declamation, public or private, political or literary, have been to
my mind a proper mode of chastising what I believe to be the offence
committed, so long as it was uncertain whether the laws of England are
not competent to restrain such lawless proceedings for the future, or
punish them in the past. The humblest & obscurest English man or woman,
animated with that respect for law & love of liberty on which the
greatness of England has been founded in past times & depends in the
future, ought in my opinion to contribute his part towards calm & legal
settlement of this question. And it is at once Edition: current; Page:
[1412] amazing & humiliating to me that anyone who has done me the
honour to read, much less to approve, of any of my writings could for
one instant doubt that I shd think so. I can understand that anyone
might doubt what might be my opinion of Mr Eyre’s conduct. I can
understand that those who have not examined it as carefully as I have
done might expect me to approve of it. But I cannot understand that
anyone shd expect me not to desire an examination of it, conducted in
the fairest & most open manner that could be attained. That the real or
supposed crimes of men in authority should be subject to judicial
examination, is the most important guarantee of English liberty, & I am
not aware that any reason has ever yet been brought forward why Mr Eyre
shd be the sole & solitary exception to this liability.

In regard to the petition concerning which you ask my opinion (that of
one of the Foreign Affairs Committees against the Abyssinian war)4 I did
not present it because I agreed in it but because I think members of
parlt shd extend as widely as possible the limits within which they
accept petitions to present. The power of petitioning is very important,
especially to all unrepresented citizens & as it can only be exercised
through members of parlt, I think they shd throw as few obstacles as
possible in the way. Those who approve of my little book on Liberty can
scarcely think me inconsistent in this opinion.

I have always thought & often said that this country was bound to
recover its envoy even by war if necessary & the manner in which the war
has been carried on by Sir R. Napier does honour to him & to our
country.5 Its success is probably owing in great measure to the spirit
of law & order which reduced the sufferings of war to the lowest
possible point amongst the people in whose country it was carried on.
The continuance of hostilities after the prisoners had been surrendered
is the one point which requires, & which will probably receive,
explanation.6

Dear Sir,—

I shd be most happy were it in my power to further your wishes in regard
to independent employment in which I most heartily sympathize: Edition:
current; Page: [1414] but there are few persons less able than myself to
do so, & although I can sincerely say that I shall not forget your name
shd any occasion offer itself to me, yet I cannot hold out any hope that
I am likely to meet with one.

In regard to the points on which you say that the convictions in which
you were brought up have been shaken I fully agree with you that it
would not be right for you to attempt to inclucate those convictions. I
think, however, that you will find them, at least as stated in your
letter, as difficult to disprove as to prove: Except indeed in the case
of prayer. I think you have omitted to mention one effect that prayer
may reasonably be said to have on the mind, & which may be granted to it
by those who doubt as well as by those who admit divine interposition in
answer to it: I mean the effect produced on the mind of the person
praying, not by the belief that it will be granted but by the elevating
influence of an endeavour to commune & to become in harmony with the
highest spiritual ideal that he is capable in elevated moments of
conceiving. This effect may be very powerful in clearing the moral
perceptions & intensifying the moral earnestness. It may be so powerful
as to leave it open to question whether it is produced solely by the
internal action of human nature itself or by a supernatural influence, &
this question will have to be resolved by each individual from his
personal experience. I know of no proof sufficient to entitle
psychologists to assert it as certain that the whole of this influence
is reducible to the known elements of human nature, however highly
probable they may think it. As to the other two points, the existence of
a Deity & the immortality of the soul, it would be still less possible
to bring negative proof to bear upon such questions that would be
conclusive to all minds. You might perhaps find much to interest you on
these matters in Mr Herbert Spencer’s First Principles2 & in Mr Grote’s
work on Plato.

As to the sentence you quote from my “Utilitarianism”;3 when I said that
the general happiness is a good to the aggregate of all persons I did
not mean that every human being’s happiness is a good to every other
human being; though I think, in a good state of society & education it
would be so. I merely meant in this particular sentence to argue that
since A’s happiness is a good, B’s a good, C’s a good, &c., the sum of
all these goods must be a good.

Dear Sir—

I did not receive your former letter until late on Tuesday night & my
reply to it therefore was written very hurriedly as well as without any
view to publication. There are consequently in it one or two expressions
which although I think them perfectly warrantable in a private
communication, I shd not wish to make use of in print, however I think
too great care cannot be taken to avoid what might be felt as violent
language in all public discussions. If however you would kindly erase
the words “abhorrence & contempt” & substitute “profound disapprobation”
for them in one sentence & in another further on would substitute “the

The report you kindly sent had been sent to me already by (I believe) Mr

enlightened views as it expressed are not common among agriculturists
but I think they are in a way rapidly to become so, & the Farmer’s Clubs
are a very valuable means of diffusing them.

Merci de votre lettre, et de l’article de l’Etoile Belge.2 C’est triste

résultat. On ne trouve un sentiment honnête et energique sur des crimes
de cet ordre que dans la classe ouvrière. Cependant la protestation n’a
pas été inutile. Elle est un obstacle à ce qu’on réintègre M. Eyre dans
les fonctions publiques. Et les journaux Eyristes se plaignent que les
gouverneurs n’oseront plus “sauver une colonie” de la même manière.

Dear Mr Fawcett

My daughter has read Mrs Fawcett’s article,2 and is extremely pleased
with it. She says, the two chief feelings that it arouses in her are,
pleasure that so good a new woman writer has arisen, so fundamentally
right in opinions, so judicious in their exposition, and so efficient in
style; and desire Edition: current; Page: [1418] that she should be
induced to write as much as possible. I have also read the article
myself, and quite concur in Helen’s opinion, and we therefore hope that
you will take all possible steps to get it published. I do not suppose
that I am likely to have influence when you have not, for this purpose,
but if you think so you have only to let me know, and I shall be glad to
use it whereever I can.

I do not feel quite sure whether there may not be a distinct use in a
College for the study of midwifery only (which function might be filled
by Dr Edmunds’ College)3 supposing that there really is a need, as he
asserts, for keeping this branch of practice apart from others. If this
is really the case, it might perhaps be worth while to insert some
sentence into the article, to the effect that “space will not allow of
entering into the question whether there should exist a College for
midwifery distinct from other branches of medical science, which may
perhaps prove a useful innovation on established practice; but in that
case the title Female Medical College would be a misnomer, as the
purpose of the College would be to qualify practitioners for one branch
only of medical practice.”4 I do not suggest these words, but I merely
put them to indicate in what direction I think, so far as I am at
present informed, a concession might be made to Dr Edmunds (that is, to
Dr Chapman) without departing from the principles so ably advocated in
the article and which we so thoroughly agree in; for it is not
inconsistent with these to think that midwifery ought to be a special
branch of medical science, and that facilities ought to be created for
enabling women to study it by itself. I do not know whether Mrs Fawcett
takes this view: if she does, it is perhaps possible that a
qualification of this sort introduced into the article might meet Dr
Chapman’s wishes: and if Mrs Fawcett does take this view, it would
perhaps be fair to Dr Edmunds to say something of the sort, and repay
him good for evil.

I return Cairnes’ very interesting letter. I am happy that he speaks
hopefully of some improvement in his health: and if there is some
improvement, we may hope that there will be more. I am

July 5. 1868

Dear Sir—

I hope you will pardon me for the delay in acknowledging your letter
dated as long ago as February. Parliamentary business is so exacting & I
receive such a multitude of letters which require an immediate answer
that I am often obliged to put aside for a time those which admit of
delay.

Your impression is quite correct that I was applied to from Victoria in
consequence of the use made by Protectionists of the passage in my Pol
Econ Edition: current; Page: [1420] which speaks of the occasional
benefit in a young country of aiding the naturalization of an industry
suited to its circumstances. I did, at that time, return an answer,2
which was published in a Victoria newspaper, to the effect that if this
encouragement took the form of a protecting duty, it should be strictly
limited to a moderate number of years & not continued beyond. I have not
altered the opinion that such encouragement is sometimes useful & that
in many cases the most just mode in which it could be given is that of a
temporary protecting duty, on condition that it should be known &
declared to be merely temporary, & of no very long duration. But I
confess that I almost despair of this general understanding being ever
practically established. I find that in Australia, protection is not
advocated in this form or for this purpose, but that the vulgarest &
most exploded fallacies are revived in its support. As far as I can
perceive, those who contend for protection in Australia mean it to be as
permanent as any other legislative arrangements & hold to all the false
theories on the subject, of which Europe is rapidly ridding itself &
which are declining even in America.3 In such a state of opinion as this
I shd resist, with my utmost strength, any protection whatever, because
it is far easier to withstand these false & pernicious doctrines before
they have been carried into practice to any serious extent, than after
powerful protected interests have been allowed to grow up under their
influence.

Allow me to express my high sense of the ability & effectiveness of your
letter, signed H., on this question.4 Such clear expositions of the
principles of the subject are what can alone be trusted to for combating
any natural prejudices in a free & popularly governed country.

I well remember your exertions for the adoption of Mr Hare’s system in
the election of the Legislative Council & the very valuable report in
which you discussed the subject.5 The debates in the British Parlt which
have since occurred may well have struck you by the amount of ignorance
they disclosed; but great & daily progress is making in the correction
of that ignorance, & many political men, including some of the most
active & intelligent leaders of the working classes, are now converted
to Mr Hare’s system, in principle at least, & frequently even in its
detail.6 The doctrine of personal representation is making the same
rapid progress among thinking minds on the Continent & in America. But
as you are probably in correspondence with Mr Hare you have access to
the best source of information on this subject.

Dear Sir

My friend Mr Edwin Chadwick who is looking out for a seat in the House
of Commons, and who would be one of the greatest acquisitions to the new
Parliament that it could possibly receive has been told there might be a
chance for the third seat at Glasgow to a candidate who could appeal as
he can to great services rendered to the working classes (as the author
of the first Factory Acts, a most efficient worker for Short Time, the
great promoter of sanitary measures etc.) and at the same time might be
less obnoxious to the higher classes of electors than a firmly working
class candidate. Mr Chadwick presided at the Health section of the
Social Sciences Association when Edition: current; Page: [1422] it met
at Glasgow and delivered an address there,2 which may have made him in
some degree locally known. There is no person living whom I am so
anxious to be in Parliament as Mr Chadwick, and I know not any one at
Glasgow so likely as yourself to be able to give an impartial opinion as
to the possibilities of the case. It is of no use taking the opinion of
the usual party leaders as to what are the opinions of the working men;
but you, perhaps, have the means of knowing something about them from
the working men themselves. If you have, I should feel it a personal
favour as well as a public service if you would give Mr Chadwick the
benefit of your knowledge, and of your help if he should resolve to
stand.

I thank you very much for your letter. Bouverie is a very doubtful
liberal; he was reckoned an Adullamite2 in 1866, and made a speech early
this session attacking the liberal party and its leaders and reproaching
Disraeli for not having coalesced with the backward Whigs.3 Chadwick
would have no scruple about standing against him if he were invited by a
sufficient number of electors.4 Should you be able and willing to sound
any of your friends in the Kilmarnock boroughs as to the possibility of
a requisition? No words I could use would overstate the value of a
thoughtful and contriving administrative mind like that of Chadwick in

originality or value. The papers I enclose containing information

take place under the patronage and in the presence of the supposed élite

It is very lucky that you have family connexions at Dumfries. The chance
seems better there than anywhere else that we have heard of. Scotch
electors, besides that they have more intelligence, are not open to
bribes, and in the present electioneering, are shewing in many places a
strong feeling against canvassing and election expenses. But I would
suggest to you whether you had not better go down yourself at once.
Already chances which you might have had in constituencies, have been
intercepted by some one else merely by his being beforehand, and the
same thing has happened to other excellent candidates within my
knowledge. For this reason, and because I doubt if the Secretary of the
Reform League at Glasgow would be able to go about to the different
boroughs of the district, I return your cheque; but if you wish it, I
will send £10 to Professor Nichol to be expended at his discretion.

If there is a subscription, the £50 I formerly promised is at your
service; as well as a letter of the strongest recommendation.

I have read your letter with the pleasure your letters always give me,

by it, and presented to the new Parliament as soon as possible after it

Dear Sir

I have heard with much gratification that it is under the consideration
of some of the advanced Liberals to put forward my old friend Mr
Chadwick for one of the districts of Scottish boroughs;2 for not only do
I deem Mr Chadwick eminently qualified for a seat in the House of
Commons, both for the work he would himself do, & for that which he
would be the cause of in others, but I should consider his absence from
the next Parliament as a public misfortune. Any constituency that
returns him to Parliament will in my opinion be doing a public service
of great value & would do itself still further honour if he were to be
returned free of expense.

I have known Mr Chadwick with considerable intimacy from the time when
both of us were very young men.3 He was then quite unknown to the
public, but was already active in a quiet way in standing up against
jobbing & oppression; & it is within my knowledge (for I was aware of
every step in the proceedings) that within a very short interval he had
the principal share in defeating two different attempts to commit great
public and private wrong. He had even then bestowed much thought & study
on the details of administration, & some papers which he wrote on
administrative subjects4 attracted the notice of Mr Senior, who
appointed him an Assistant Commissioner under the original Commission of
Poor Law Inquiry, in which capacity he displayed such superior ability
that he was made a member of the Commission itself,5 for the express
purpose of assisting in drawing up the New Poor Law. No one, except Mr
Senior, had so great a share as Mr Chadwick in originating all that was
best in the Poor Law of 1834; & had his counsel been taken in all
respects as it was in some, had his clauses respecting the education of
Pauper Children not been rejected in the House of Lords—had his plans
been accepted for the separation of the sick, the lunatic, the old, &
the young from one another & from the able-bodied, & their distribution
in different houses with a view to totally different modes of treatment,
not Edition: current; Page: [1432] only would the vast expense of
constructing the Union Workhouses have been in a great measure saved,
but the greatest blots upon our present Poor Law Administration would
have been effectually provided against.

The next of Mr Chadwick’s great public services was as a member of the
Factory Commission6 which proposed & carried the limitation of the
labours of children in factories to six hours. From that time Mr
Chadwick has never ceased to occupy himself with the improvement of the
condition of factory operatives. He was the proposer, & has been the
indefatigable apostle of the half time school system by which the
education of the children of the operative classes has been made
compatible with the necessities of the family. He proposed but did not
succeed in carrying a measure for the protection of the operatives, by
making masters pecuniarily responsible for accidents. He has been, from
the beginning, the leading mind of the sanitary movement,7 which has
done so much, & will do so much more to improve not only the health but
the moral & economical condition of the working population generally &
especially of its most neglected portions. Almost as much of his time &
thoughts has been employed upon the great question of public education
in its most difficult department, its business details, & I know of no
one capable of being of so much use to our future ministers and
legislators in forming an organized plan by which the most efficient
education can be given to the whole people at the smallest sacrifice
either to the public or to individuals. I have touched only on main
points; for, to go through all the minor, but still important matters of
public interest which he has helped forward, would take up far too much
time & space. I may say in brief, that he is one of the organizing &
contriving minds of the age; a class of minds of which there are very
few, & still fewer who apply those qualities to the practical business
of government. He is, moreover, one of the few persons who have a
passion for the public good; and nearly the whole of his time is devoted
to it, in one form or another.

With respect to political questions in the narrower sense of the word, I
may say that Mr Chadwick was highly esteemed by Mr Bentham,8 the father
of enlightened Radicalism; that throughout life I have seldom had
occasion to differ from him on subjects of that nature; & should we be
returned to Edition: current; Page: [1433] Parliament there are few
whose vote I should expect oftener to agree with mine on all subjects
involving the principles of popular government.

I regret that your arrival in England should have taken place just after
I had left for the Continent with no prospect of returning until the eve
of the general election. Should you still be in the neighbourhood of
London at that time, I hope I may have the pleasure of seeing and
conversing with you.

Edition: current; Page: [1434]
The changes in the opinions and feelings of large bodies of Englishmen
and Englishwomen even within the last few years, are as striking to me
as they are to you.2 The old fetters of prejudice and routine seem to be
giving way on all sides, and what is wanted now is clear and well
considered positive opinions. All the great subjects, political, social,
and religious, are brought into question; and there is a preparation
going on in England, as there is in the United States, for a much better
settlement of them than the world has yet had: but, naturally, the
evidences of this are not so obvious on the surface as are those of the
breaking up of old doctrines.

You probably think that I have forgotten my promise3 to write a letter
on the Repudiation question, for publication in America.4 I have always
kept it in mind; but as long as the session lasted, I never found time,
nor was able to turn my mind to the subject with sufficient steadiness.
Since I have been here, I have written the draft of a letter which now
only requires revision, and when it is finished I will forward it to
you, to be made use of in any manner which in your judgment it may be
fitted for. Will you kindly let me know if it should be sent to your

Dear Sir—

I shd be sorry indeed if your election could be perilled, but I do not
think it can be. I understood from Mr Bradlaugh not only that he had no
intention of standing against you, but that he considered your election
certain:2 & I hope you will not allow yourself to be persuaded that one
of Edition: current; Page: [1435] the mere rank & file Liberals can be
as valuable in the H of C. as yourself. But (although for totally
different reasons) I think Mr B. also would be a very valuable member of
Parlt. He also holds opinions not cut after the pattern of some 300 or
so other liberal members of Pt, & I think him able to sustain them with
ability which would give them effect. This is what we want in the H of
C., & while it is most important to uphold honest & honorable men,
faithful supporters of our own party, like Lord Henley3 against Tories &
lukewarm Liberals, I do not think that their claims ought to be allowed
to prevail against the claims of exceptional men. Where there are two
men to sustain one opinion & only one man to sustain another, the one is
a more valuable man than either of the two: & after all, the men willing
to vote against the Irish Church4 are at least 200 to one as against men
holding original opinions of their own like yourself & Mr Bradlaugh.
Moreover, the good average liberal, especially if he is a man of rank,
is likely to have a better chance for a larger number of constituencies
than such a man as Mr Bradlaugh: you will see that I urged upon Mr B.
the importance of not allowing a Tory to step in, & this seems to me the
only important consideration in the matter. You will perhaps let me add
that I could scarcely forbear smiling at the modesty which could let you
suppose that you were the candidate against whom Mr B’s efforts are
likely to have the greatest effect, even if he did oppose you, which I
sincerely believe he would not do.

As I have not heard from you since your letter of Aug. 28, and as I see

are now at Richmond. I am a good deal disappointed that nothing came of
your Edition: current; Page: [1436] visit to Scotland. In your place, I
think I should have run the chance.3 I should have tried whether, by
holding meetings, without spending much money, a sufficient impression
might not have been made, to obtain the warm support of the working
classes: Nichol’s opinion is worth more than twenty discouragements from
members or candidates or their middle class partisans, who are sure to
be against disturbing any member, who is nominally of their party, in
his seat. The main consideration is, whether you are likely to find any
better opening elsewhere. If so, it will be either through Glyn4 or
Beales,5 Beales the more likely of the two. There is still time before
you, but not much more than enough, as all the constituencies are
getting fitted with candidates. Your best chance is in the recalcitrancy
of the new electors against the wealthy nobodies who are imposed on them
by the old party managers. But you need to be ready to seize these
opportunities at once, before some unwealthy or popularity-hunting
nobody has got the start. Many an opportunity has been missed by good
candidates in this general election already, for want of promptitude.

I am much obliged to you for your letter, which I shall place among the

revision of my Logic. I was not aware of the antiquity of the phrase ars
artium2 as applied to Logic. I had marked the humourous doggrel from
Molière3 to be quoted correctly, instead of incorrectly, as I had done
on the authority of Whewell. The words I used in p. 71 were probably
also quoted at secondhand from some writer who retained the pith of the
satire without remembering its words. I may have followed many modern
authorities in speaking of occult causes when I ought to have spoken of
occult qualities.4 Who was the introducer of the former phrase? Was it
Descartes?

Probably I had better substitute some other phrase for “second
intention” in my illustration of no meaning.5 I know the meaning, indeed

intention,” and it is best not to stumble against possible sense when

Virtus Dormitiva

In the article ‘Physique’ of the Dict. de Phil. Schol. of the Abbé
Migne’s collection,6 after noting the virtutes and essentiae as
scholastic faults, which is only true of their abuses, the author
proceeds thus:—

‘Arnauld7 lui-même, Arnauld le Cartésien, pratiquait les vieux erremens
de la scholastique, lorsqu’il disait à Malebranche,8 “Il est insensé de
se demander pourquoi l’âme humaine pense à l’infini et au nécessaire.
Elle y pense parce que c’est dans son essence d’y penser.”

‘Aujourd’hui encore l’école écossaise et l’école éclectique expliquent
exclusivement les phénomènes psychologiques par des facultés qu’on
multiplie et qu’on distingue parfois avec une ridicule subtilité; et on
s’imagine qu’en plaçant ainsi sous les faits intimes des facultés que la
conscience n’a jamais perçues on a fait de la science.

‘L’école rationaliste commet la même erreur dans la question de
l’origine du langage. L’homme parle parce qu’il a la faculté, donc il a
pu inventer la parole.’

The Schoolmen never generalised a quality until they had at least two
instances. As long as there was only A which had a certain virtus, they
said nothing about it; it was occult, i.e. unknown. But when B was found
to have the same they had such knowledge as comes of classification,
being almost all they had.

The moderns invented a name upon one instance, and made it a cause. They
said that magnetism was the explanation of the magnet. The Schoolmen
would have waited until the amber showed its quality, and then the
distinction of magnetism and electricity would have been specific
knowledge, the genus being virtus attractiva. It is something to know
two phenomena with a generic agreement and a specific difference.

Edition: current; Page: [1439]
If the medical candidate had known the mind of those who classed, he
would have said, I do not know why except in that I can refer the
phenomenon to a class. We note agreements and differences and arrange
them. Arnauld, &c., might have a similar answer made for them, but not
for those who inferred power of invention of languages from possession.

Dear Sir

The numbers of the Illustrated Weekly News which you were so kind as to
send, were only quite recently forwarded to me here. The articles on
Trade Unions2 to which you call my attention seem to me very sensible,
and I agree in all essentials with them. I am quite of opinion that the
various forms of Cooperation (among which the one most widely applicable
at present to production, as distinguished from distribution, is what
you term the system of small percentage partnerships) are the real and
only thorough means of healing the feud between capitalists and
labourers; and, while tending eventually to supersede trade unions, are
meanwhile a natural and gradually increasing corrective of their
operation.

I look also with hope to the ultimate working of the foreign
competition, on the effects of which you dwell in the first of the two
articles. The operatives are now fully alive to this part of the case,
and are beginning to try how far the combination principle among
labourers for wages, admits of becoming international,3 as it has
already become national instead of only local, and general instead of
being confined to each trade without help from other trades. The final
experiment has thus commenced, the result of which will fix the limits
of what the trade union principle can do. And the larger view of
questions which these considerations open up, and which is already
visibly enlightening the minds of the more advanced workpeople, will
dispose them more and more to look for the just improvement of their
condition rather in Edition: current; Page: [1440] becoming their own
capitalists, or allying themselves on fair conditions with the owners of
capital, than in their present uncomfortable, and often disastrous,
relations with them. I am

The question of standing against Mr Bouverie is, of course, entirely for

be considered as aiming at the character of an independent member.

Dear Sir

Along with this, I send you the letter which I have written for
publication.2 I have, on consideration, thought it best not to address
it to an American newspaper, which would be too like arrogating to
myself the right of lecturing the American people. I have given it the
form of an answer to a private friend who has asked my opinion on the
question. If you will honour me so far as Edition: current; Page: [1442]
to be that private friend, please fill up the blank at the beginning
with your own name.3 In any other case, three stars must stand for a
name.

Should there be any mistake of fact, or anything that seems to you
injudicious, or otherwise objectionable in the letter, you would do me a
favour by pointing it out. It is unnecessary in that case to send the
letter back, as I have kept a copy.

There is no doubt that the feeling of the mass of the working classes in
England is very much alienated from the propertied classes.4 They are
very strongly imbued with a sense of the opposition of interest between
the receivers of wages and the payers of them. But I do not think that
this feeling has reached the point of personal hatred between classes. I
think that the operatives have confidence in the good will towards them
of many persons in the higher and middle ranks, and that experience has
taught them to expect that the others will be brought round gradually by
the joint influence of conviction, persuasion, and prudence. The
intelligent, who are the politically active part of the working classes,
are not impatient; they have a sincere dread of the mass of brutal
ignorance behind them, and have consequently set themselves to demand
very vigorously a real national education. This they will soon obtain, &
it will alter, in an incalculable degree, all the bad elements of the
existing state of things. Already the aspirations of the workmen to the
improvement of their physical condition are pointing not so much to
anything to be done directly by the State, as to what they can do for
themselves by cooperation. Revolution and civil war will not come from
their side of the question; for, when their minds are sufficiently made
up, the existing political institutions are sufficient to carry into
execution their will. The political enfranchisement of women, whenever
it takes place, will further strengthen the influences opposed to
violence and bloodshed. The only question which may possibly become
dangerous is that of the land. There are signs of a rapidly growing
conviction in the operative classes that the land ought not to be
private property but should belong to the State. This opinion, which has
always seemed to me fundamentally just, may perhaps come to maturity
before the landholding classes are prepared even to listen to it; & in
that case there will be bad blood and violent class animosities: but
even then, as far as I am able to anticipate the future, it seems to me
that the probabilities Edition: current; Page: [1443] are in favour of
the settlement of the question by a succession of compromises without
coming to blows. I am

Dear Mr . . .

You ask me what I think of the controversy now going on in the United
States respecting the rightfulness of paying off a portion of the
national debt contracted in cash, in a depreciated paper currency, and
of taxing, in violation of an express compact, the interest of the
national bonds. It is painful, even to have to answer such a question.
It is already a great calamity that two such proposals should have been
inscribed in the electoral programme of a great political party,2 and
not unanimously rejected even by its opponents. The success of either
proposal would, in my estimation, be one of the heaviest blows that
could be given to the reputation of popular governments, and to the
morality and civilization of the human race.

This is one of those vital questions which send us back to the first
principles of social existence, and compel us to ask ourselves what are
the conditions which enable mankind to dwell together in nations and
communities, to work together in joint undertakings, and exchange the
privations of the savage for the blessings of civilized life. The very
first and most essential of these conditions is, that they should be
able to trust one another’s engagements. Even savage life could not be
carried on unless the savages frequently helped one another: in
civilized life every human being depends for comfort, for security,
often for life itself, upon things done for him by other people. If he
could not rely upon other people for doing what they undertake; if his
experience taught him that a man who makes a promise, does so with
Edition: current; Page: [1444] the intention of only keeping the promise
if it happens to be quite convenient; he would have to look to himself
alone for all protection, and for the supply of all his wants. He would
be below the condition of most savages. If we cannot trust each other’s
word (was the saying of an eminent man) we may as well go back to the
woods.

But if there is one case more than another in which it is indispensable
that men should keep their promises—should do what they pledge
themselves to do—it is the case of money contracts. All the complex
fabric of our civilization rests upon the paying and receiving of money;
every one’s plans of life, and almost every one’s assurance of living at
all, are built upon the expectation of receiving, at the appointed time,
the money or money’s worth due to him from others. If any one buys a
thing, and then does not pay for it; or sells a thing, and then does not
deliver it; if any one hires services, and does not pay the wages agreed
on, or receives wages, and does not perform the service; if any one
borrows money or money’s worth, and, though able, does not repay it at
the time agreed on, or withholds the equivalent which he had bargained
to give for its use; the defaulter not only proves himself a
dishonourable and dishonest man, he not only inflicts an injury, which
may be serious, which may be even irreparable, upon the individual who
has trusted him, but he does what lies in him to dissolve and put an end
to that trust in one another, without which there would be no exchange
of commodities, no separation of employments, and no man would have any
satisfaction for his wants except what his own labour or craft could
directly provide. The impossibility of carrying on human society, even
in an almost rudimentary state, without holding men to the fulfilment of
their engagements, has always been so obvious that there is not a single
known community, past or present, in which provision has not been made
for enforcing those engagements, by laws and tribunals, supported either
by a public force set apart for the purpose, or, in ruder societies, by
the collective strength of the community.

Can any reason be given why the obligation of good faith, which holds
between one man and another, is not equally binding between the entire
community and any person who has trusted them? Is a promise made by the
whole people through their authorized agents less sacred than a promise
made by a private person, which also may have been made through his
agents? Ought the fact that there is a tribunal which can compel
individuals to keep their contracts, and no tribunal which can coerce a
nation—ought the fact, that the debt of a nation is a debt of honour;
ought the fact that a nation can be a swindler and a knave if it
chooses—ought this to make any civilized people think that it can
dispense in its own favour, with the duty which its own tribunals
enforce against its citizens? Unless it be a sufficient license for
committing a crime, that it can be committed without any immediate
Edition: current; Page: [1445] penalty except the disgrace, there is no
other difference between the two cases but such as makes the criminality
greater, of a nation which robs its creditors, than of an individual.
For, in the first place, a nation always can pay its creditors if it
chooses; which cannot always be said of an individual. And, in the next
place, a breach of faith by a whole people involves everybody in the
guilt, except such as with their whole heart and strength denounce and
protest against it. It is an example of fraud displayed in the sight of
mankind, and penetrating into every family in the country. It is a
direct sanction of the like dishonesty to every citizen in his private
transactions. Let any one be really persuaded that a whole people may
break its word, and refuse to pay in full the money it has borrowed—is
he likely to think that he himself is culpable for doing the same in his
own private affairs, if he can manage to evade the legal punishment
which is the only real distinction between the two cases?

The detractors of democratic government on this side of the Atlantic
have been accustomed to say that however specious may be the arguments
for it, in its actual working it would turn out to be a retrogradation
towards barbarism. Until now, the example of the great American
Republic, notwithstanding the dishonourable conduct of several of the
States3 (mostly—would that I could say always—among those which had been
demoralized by slavery) has generally been deemed a practical refutation
of these sinister prophecies. But the charge against democracy of being
a return to barbarism would be made out, if its effect were to be the
public repudiation of pecuniary engagements. It is a remarkable fact,
that what the people of the United States are now urged to do with
respect to the five-twenty bonds4—urged by the programme of a political
party (happily not by every member even of that party) bears an almost
exact likeness to some of the most disgraceful misdeeds of the European
despots in the middle ages. Read the history of the most profligate
Kings of France and other European countries, not excepting England, and
see who were those whose conduct excited the greatest public indignation
during their lives, and left the deepest stain on their memory when
dead. They were those who debased the coin. What was their motive for
debasing it? To put off their creditors with the same nominal sum of
money, but a less quantity of the precious metal. Even the despots were
so conscious and so much afraid of the infamy of this fraud, that they
generally endeavoured to commit it secretly and in silence. They made it
a capital offence to betray the secret. Would they have been less guilty
if they had impudently brazened it out? Living in a rude age, the only
means at their Edition: current; Page: [1446] disposal for committing
the fraud was the coarse expedient of altering the coin. Their ingenuity
had not reached the contrivance of putting forth pieces of paper which
pretended to be money and were not, inducing people to take them by a
promise printed on the paper to give for it on demand real money of the
same nominal value, and then breaking that promise and issuing them in
such numbers as to be only worth half the money which they purported to
represent. But this roundabout way, and the direct way, have the
self-same purpose; to get rid of debts, by paying, instead of what one
has engaged to pay, what is called the same sum of money, but is really
a much smaller sum. And this example, set by the despots of barbarous
ages, the people of the United States, in the ninety-second year of
their national freedom, are invited by many of their active politicians
to imitate!

Observe, too, that none of the apologies, poor and weak as they are,
which have been suggested to the nations of Europe by the same sort of
bad advisers, have any applicability to the case of the United States.
The Democracy of European countries have sometimes been told that they
are not bound to pay their national debts, because the money was
borrowed by Kings and aristocracies who did not represent the people,
and was expended in keeping the people in subjection or in carrying on
foreign wars which the people had not authorized. None of these lame
excuses can be alleged by the American repudiators. The most audacious
pleader for dishonesty cannot deny that the money was borrowed by a
Congress and a President elected by, and fully responsible to, the
people—borrowed for the service of the American Republic in its utmost
need, for a war which was emphatically a war of the people, and in which
the stake involved was the preservation of their collective existence as
a nation. The only persons in whose mouths any other doctrine can
possibly be sincere, are the ex-rebels and their favourers. To all but
them, it is impossible even to conceive a case in which the obligation
to pay the debt, principal and interest, to the full extent of the
contract, could be more binding.

A plea which imposes upon some people, who would shrink from anything
which they themselves regarded as repudiation, is this: Greenbacks,5
however they may be depreciated, are legal tender—are the lawful
currency of the United States: other persons are obliged to receive this
currency in payment of all their dues, and why should the public
creditor be an exception? This seems to have been the argument which
prevailed with the upright, but not always clearsighted or discerning
mind of the late Thaddeus Stevens.6 Edition: current; Page: [1447] But
the answers to it are manifold. The first is, that almost all persons
except the public creditor have the remedy in their own hands. Those who
have goods to sell can and do demand a higher price; those who sell
their services can and do require a higher remuneration. Even in loan
transactions that are yet to come, the lenders know the chances they are
exposed to—are aware that the medium they are to be paid in is of
uncertain value, and can and will require a rate of interest sufficient
in their estimation to cover their risks. To all these persons the
uncertainty of the measure of value is a source of great inconvenience,
but to none of them is it an injustice. Injustice is done to those who
had lent their money, or had otherwise become entitled to fixed annual
incomes, before specie payments were suspended. Among these are the old
creditors of many of the States. All persons thus situated are
grievously injured, by being paid their interest in depreciated
greenbacks, and would be still further defrauded if the principal were
repaid to them in a similar medium. But at least the nation collectively
had incurred no obligation to those persons, beyond the general
obligation of good government. It had not specifically pledged the
national honour to them. Even the separate States never, I believe,
pledged their faith to their creditors that they should not suffer this
particular injury; however binding the obligation ought to have been
felt in honour and conscience. That pledge has been given to the
creditors of the United States. I make no distinction between payment of
the interest, and repayment of the principal. The bonds themselves, it
is not denied, stipulate expressly that the interest shall be paid in
cash, but are silent as to the principal. That the obligation, however,
applied to principal as well as interest, was universally understood;
was expressly declared by the authorized agents of the nation whenever
the question was asked; was not then gainsaid by any of those who are
now attempting to shake off the obligation, and was only not declared in
expressed terms because nobody thought that such a declaration was
necessary, or could add any strength to the pledge. In consequence of
this understanding the loans were obtained at rates of interest very low
under the circumstances; far lower than would otherwise have been
possible. Governments which pay their creditors in inconvertible paper
always borrow, if able to borrow at all, on much more onerous terms than
other Governments. If those who lent their savings to the United States
had been told at the time, that every thousand dollars they lent should
be repaid to them in greenbacks which might then be worth not more than
a thousand cents (the depreciation of the French assignats amounted to
that and more) nobody, unless he could afford to make the nation a
present of his money, would have parted with it unless at a rate of
interest sufficient to ensure him against this extreme risk. The United
States obtained these great sums of money in their extreme necessity, at
an interest (all things considered) not very much exceeding what the
high value of capital in a new country compels them to pay in ordinary
times; and after having reaped the Edition: current; Page: [1448]
benefit—having by that indispensable help, saved their national
existence, they are now exhorted to withhold the price, at the cost of
the national honour.

The same reasons of justice and good faith apply still more obviously to
the condition, expressly stipulated by the lenders, that the interest on
the bonds should not be subject to direct taxation. Some people imagine
that the breach of this stipulation would not be robbery provided that
the bonds are not taxed at a higher rate than other property.7 Now I
find it stated as a known fact, that they are already subject to the
same direct taxation as other property; that the income they yield is
subject to income tax. But even if they were not, of what consequence
would it be if exemption from all direct taxation were a condition of
the contract? An exemption expressly stipulated for, is not an unjust
advantage conceded to them over other people, since for every advantage
so obtained, value has been given by those who enjoy it, in the shape of
a diminished interest. The only difference in respect of taxation
between them and the rest of the public is, that they have paid down
their taxes in advance, while other people wait for the visit of the
tax-gatherer. To make them pay over again, under pretence that they had
not already paid, would be one of the most flagrant forms of the
iniquity of breaking a contract and keeping the pecuniary consideration
received for it.

But there is little danger that these immoral counsels will prevail. It
has been shewn by many examples in the recent history of the United
States, that an agitation for something wrong and mischievous may go on
for a certain length of time without visibly stirring up the good sense
and honesty of the country to resist it; and many such agitations
commence, culminate and decay, without disturbing public tranquillity,
or leaving any permanent traces of their existence: but that when one of
these agitations attains a sufficient height to begin to be dangerous, a
mass of opinion which ordinarily remains quiescent rouses itself into
activity, puts down the wrong thing with a vigorous hand, and
peremptorily demands the right thing instead. So, I doubt not, it will
be with this pernicious and discreditable, but, as I firmly believe,
chiefly factitious movement, set up by political adventurers for the
chance of gaining the few stray votes which, in the present state of the
parties, might suffice to turn the balance of many an election.

Dear Sir—

I am exceedingly sorry that you should have had any trouble or annoyance
in consequence of my subscription for the election of Mr Bradlaugh.2
When, some time ago, I was asked to allow my name to be put on Mr B.’s
Commee I declined, giving as my reason that I thought myself bound to
consider the possible wishes of my friends in W[estminste]r. But when it
came to a question of refusing any support whatever to Mr B. to whom I
shd certainly have given some had I never been put forward for W, it
appeared to me that it would be inconsistent with the footing on which I
stand with the constituency, as well as not altogether open on my part,
were I to act otherwise as member for W. than I shd have done before W.
did me the honour to choose me. In giving this aid to Mr B. I did not
take at all into consideration his religious opinions, with which as
practical politicians we have nothing whatever to do. Though, like
yourself I know his career only by report, I have understood that he was
formerly violent & intemperate in his language, a defect which it is to
be hoped may disappear with time but which if it does not he will share
with some of the best known men in the H. of Commons, for there are
several members of Parlt whom few working men at all events would be
disposed to consider models of temperance in speech, yet whom all
parties are willing to see in the House because they are forcible
exponents of a particular point of view. It may be said for Mr B. in
palliation that persecution naturally provokes violence, & at the time
when he commenced men were still put in prison for expressing his
opinions, indeed, if I remember right, he himself has been imprisoned
for them.3

But with regard to Mr B’s political opinions & conduct all that I know
is greatly in his favour, No one who is active in politics on the
radical side seems to me less open than he is to the much lavished
accusations of being Edition: current; Page: [1450] a demagogue or a
panderer to popular prejudice. He seems to me a thinking man, who forms
his opinions for himself, & defends them with equal ardour whether they
attract or alienate those whom he seeks to influence. I may mention as
one example, that he is a strenuous supporter of representation of
minorities which whether right or wrong (a thing I do not now discuss)
at least proves him to be no friend to the despotism of the greater
number; & as a second example his earnest Malthusianism which places him
in opposition to a vast mass of popular prejudice, supposed to be
particularly rife among the radicals of the working classes. If the
capability of taking & the courage of maintaining such views as these is
not a recommendation, to impartial persons, of an extreme radical
politician, what is?

With regard to his standing against Liberals, or rather against a
Liberal, for to my excellent friend Mr Gilpin he disclaims all
opposition,4 I am extremely desirous that you should fully understand my
opinion on that subject. Undoubtedly the point of first importance at
the present juncture, is to return to Parlt supporters of Mr Gladstone &
of the disendowment of the Irish Church. This object ought not to be
sacrificed to any other & a member whose vote can be relied on for this
purpose ought not to be opposed at any risk of bringing in a Tory. You
are aware that I have cautioned Mr B. on this point as I do everyone to
whom I give any advice about the approaching elections. But the
importance of the immediate struggle ought not to make us forget that
the Parlt we are going to elect has much other work to do besides
this—that we are looking to it for a general revision of our
institutions & for making a commencement of effort against the many
remediable evils which infest the existing state of society. Already the
too exclusive attention to one great question has caused it to be
generally remarked, by friends & enemies, that there will be very little
new blood in the future Parlt, that the new H of C will be entirely
composed of the same men, or the same kind of men, as the old one. Now I
do not hesitate to say that this is not what ought to happen. We want,
in the first place, representatives of the classes, now first admitted
to the representation. And in the next place we want men of
understanding whose minds can admit ideas not included in the
conventional creed of Liberals or of Radicals, & men also of ardent
zeal, even if not always according to discretion, for it will all be
wanted to make every impression against the force of at least negative
resistance of those who are satisfied with their own position in life, &
without meaning any harm are careless of evils because they do not feel
them. Were Mr B in Parlt, his zeal and ability would be of great use &
his violence, if he were still violent, could do no harm except to
himself: & he is a much less able man than I take him for if he ever
again repeats such errors of violence as those he is accused of.

These are the reasons why I shd be glad to see Mr B in the H. of C. &
Edition: current; Page: [1451] why, though I shd have preferred to see
him displace a Tory, I still desire his success even against Lord
Henley; who, moreover, would probably have much less difficulty than Mr
B. in obtaining another seat.5 I can say most sincerely that no one more
thoroughly disapproves than I do any conduct or expressions needlessly
offensive to the reverential feelings of any one even if I had less
sympathy of feeling with him than I have with many pious minds.

I beg to acknowledge your communication of the 23rd ult.

I have subscribed to the fund for the election of Mr. Bradlaugh,2
because, in my opinion, the change which has been made in the
constitution of Parliament will be a comparative failure unless the
opinions and feelings of the working classes are represented in it; and
because the persons representing those opinions and feelings who seem
likely to obtain seats in the new Parliament are far less numerous than
I think it desirable they should be.

We are looking to the new House of Commons, not solely for putting the
Liberal party in office and disestablishing the Irish Church, but for
making a commencement of measures calculated to improve the material and
social condition of the mass of the people. This cannot be expected
unless the suffering as well as the prosperous classes are represented
in the House, and represented by men who are capable of making their
voices heard.—I am, dear sir, yours very faithfully,

Dear Mr Bouverie

It is of so much importance to the public good that the very best man
each party possesses should be sent to represent it in the House of
Commons, that it is much to be desired that every constituency should
consider, not merely whether a man will do to represent it, but whether
he is the best man to be had; and that every candidate should consider
first, not his own claims and wishes, but the public interest. For my
own part I can fairly disclaim acting ungenerously towards yourself when
I warmly support the candidature of Mr Chadwick, because I would very
gladly put him in my own place if I saw a probability of success. I
consider Mr Chadwick to be an altogether exceptional man, to whom it
would be an honour to any other man to give way; because, however
superior he may consider himself, or might actually be, to Mr Chadwick
in some things, there are others (of extreme importance in Parliament)
in which Mr Chadwick has not his equal in England, nor, so far as I
know, in Europe.

In regard to the matter of sowing dissensions among the Liberal party, I
could say a great deal, which I am sure would meet with sympathy in the
Edition: current; Page: [1454] advanced portion of it at least, and
would shew to all portions that I am not acting without very cogent
reasons. I need not enter into these at present, because, as you will
see from what I have already said, there exist reasons enough peculiar
to Mr Chadwick, to decide my line of conduct towards him, even without
reference to more general considerations. I am

Dear Sir

I am truly glad that you are pleased with the letter,2 and that you
think its publication will be of service. On the matter of fact as to
the liability of the bonds to income tax, my original impression was
what I now learn to be the correct one; but I found the contrary so
positively stated in articles and letters in newspapers, that I supposed
I had been mistaken, and altered my first draft accordingly. The
rectification3 you have been so kind as to make will perfectly meet the
case.

I should have been glad if your name could have appeared in the first
line, but on that point your judgment and feelings must decide.

I have no uneasiness as to the future of England from the two points in
its condition which you mention in your letter. Those “who would work if
they could find work to do,” will, I think, find their field of
employment greatly widened by the rapid progress of industrial
improvement, and such of them as the growth of the national wealth does
not provide employment for, will be more and more taken off by
emigration. “Those who would not work even if work were abundant and
wages fair” are a comparatively limited class of the lowest of the
population, and whatever they make it necessary to do in order to keep
them in obedience to law will have the fullest support from the
respectable working people. “The ignorance and hopelessness of the mass
of the agricultural labourers” are in a fair way to be removed. The
movement will soon be irresistible for a national education which will
include them; Edition: current; Page: [1455] and as soon as they have
intelligence to know that better wages are to be had in the
manufacturing towns, or in the United States or the Colonies, they will
flock thither. Emigration, already so great an element in the social
economy of Ireland, is only beginning to reach the agricultural
districts of England. It will be the great safety valve, and will, I
think, prevent the stir that is sure to take place in the minds of the
agricultural labourers from having any other than a wholesome effect.

In the United States, ever since the North shook off the yoke of the
South, the most favourable prophecies are always those which are
verified. Allow me to say with what pleasure and instruction, always
increasing, I read the North American Review.4 The July number is
perhaps the best I have yet read. I am

Dear Sir—

You are no doubt aware that Mr Chadwick has gone down to the Kilmarnock
burghs, that he has been very successful, has been generally accepted by
the working men as their candidate & that they are very confident of
being able to return him as their member. I hear from Mr C. that in the
opinion of his supporters, the only thing which gives Mr Bouverie a
chance is the candidature of Mr McDonald, who is Secretary to the Miners
Union & is expected to carry with him the miners of one of the five
burghs, Rutherglen, which is a mining place, but who, it seems, has very
little support in the other four burghs, & though he has an encouraging
letter from Professor Beesly,2 is not thought to have any chance of
success, but may perhaps take from Mr C. a sufficient number of votes to
turn the scale in favour of Mr Bouverie if the Whigs & Tories unite as
they probably will. Both Whigs & Tories prefer any one of the old set of
backward politicians to any man with troublesome new ideas. The inclosed
report from the Glasgow Herald shews the complete failure of Mr McDonald
at Kilmarnock. At Mr Chadwick’s meeting at K it Edition: current; Page:
[1456] was estimated that he had more than a thousand workmen for him,
but his supporters, not to offend the miners, & to let them do the best
they could, did not move an amendment at Mr McD’s meeting. It would be a
great triumph of advanced opinion if Mr C. were elected & it will be a
great pity if McD’s candidature shd prevent it. Mr C. was put forward
before Mr McD. was known to be in the field, & he would be more listened
to in the House even on the subject of the miners, than Mr McD; having
paid special attention to their condition, as was shewn in his report on
the sanitary condition of the labouring population in 18423 as well as
on subsequent occasions.4 I write this to you because if you are able to
bring any influence to bear on Mr McD. either directly or through Prof
Beesly that might induce him to retire you may perhaps think it
desirable to do so.5 No one man that I know is likely to do so much in
the House for the interests of the working people as Mr C. & now when he
seems to have a good chance it would be sad indeed that such a hindrance
as this shd defeat it.

You are yourself encumbered by an obstacle of a similar kind, though
from a much more considerable person, Mr Newton.6 I earnestly hope he
may be induced to postpone his candidature or to try his chance with
some other constituency. No radical or working class candidate ought to
place himself in competition with you though it was of course quite
right & no more than was to be expected from your public spirit that you
should as you did set an example of willingness to be governed by any
[illegible word] like a division of the liberal electors.

Dear Sir—

The letter of which you enclose a copy was written by me. I believe
there can be no doubt that Mr Bradlaugh is a very fair representative of
the opinions of a very large & important portion of the working men of
England. I, who have always maintained that the working classes do not
form Edition: current; Page: [1457] a homogeneous mass all exactly like
one another, as we have been often told they do by their opponents, of
course admit most readily that Mr B. is no fair representative of other
large & important sections of the working class. But as there are in the
H. of C. & ought to be, representatives of the Quakers, the R.
Catholics, many of the various Dissenters as well as of the C. of
England, & the Jews, so I do not see why the working classes may not
have one representative of opinions which are indisputably extremely
rife among many of them however distasteful these opinions may be to
many others.

I say all this as regards what if I understand rightly is the main
objection to Mr B. because I would fully face the most serious
difficulty: & I do not hesitate to say that if Mr B. chooses to take his
stand upon what are called secularist principles in religion, & can
succeed nevertheless in inducing any constituency to send him to Parlt,
he ought not to be prevented from doing so by want of funds: for in that
case it is plain that he must represent a class of opinions sufficiently
considerable to have a right to be represented. But I am not aware that
Mr B. does take his stand upon these principles. I understand him to
come forward as a representative of purely political opinions & in that
case I do not think that any one is entitled to object to him on the
ground of religious opinions: for to do so is contrary to the principles
we follow when Jews &c. are admitted to Parlt. If Mr B. were a rich man,
I shd not have taken any steps to forward his election; had he been a
rich man, I think no one would have blamed me if I had taken any such
steps. As a matter of fact I have done nothing whatever to forward Mr
B.’s election except to help to remove in a very small degree whatever
obstacle poverty may be to his chances. I pronounce no opinion upon his
merits but leave them to be judged by those who are better qualified to
judge them than I can profess to be myself.

Dear Chadwick

I have received your two letters of Sept. 30 and Oct. 4. We are, as you
may well imagine, highly delighted at your excellent prospects. For the
purpose Edition: current; Page: [1458] of getting Mr McDonald out of
your way,2 I should have more faith in the influences of the
constituency itself than in any others, for it is only local opinion
that will make him think he has no chance of success. I have, however,
written a long letter to Beales on the subject. Mr Beesly, though I
believe I was once introduced to him, I hardly know even by sight, and
have no reason to think that I have any influence with him. For aught I
know, he might even be disposed to go against any recommendation of
mine. Beesly belongs, I fancy, to one of the advanced Comtist sets, and
they, you know, do not at all go along with me. Mr Beales may have
influence with him or with McDonald, and may be willing to exert it; it
is, however, just possible that McDonald represents the Potter section
of the Trades Unionists,3 and I rather believe there is a split between
that and the League. I am not, however, quite sure of this, and so I
have written to Beales.

Some days ago I received a mild expostulation from Mr Bouverie. I wrote
to him in reply,4 saying, among other things, that I must be acquitted
of acting ungenerously towards him in supporting your candidature,
because I would gladly give up my own seat to you, if I thought I were
able to do it: and I told him that any man might be proud to give way to
you, and hinted pretty plainly that public spirit called upon him to do
so. I thought it best, however, not to open upon any of my personal
grievances against him (e.g. his attack upon Gladstone,5 and Adullamite
proclivities) to himself. I am rather surprised at his writing to me,
and cannot think what his motive was; but I do not think he is likely to
make use of my letter, because it was the most glowing eulogium of you
that I could well get into the space.

There is nothing that I can do, beyond what I have done, in the matter
of the election for the Institute.6 It would be hopeless to attempt to
influence the time of the election.

I think it is a mistake to suppose that my support of Bradlaugh7 at all
diminishes my weight. The sort of people with whom it does so have had
to put up with my Women’s Suffrage, Jamaica Committee, representation of
minorities, and other “crotchets”, and probably have long ago given me
up, or more properly speaking, have never taken me up at all. You know
that my Malthusian and religious heresies, and my accusing the working
people of not speaking the truth, were all brought up against me at the
Westminster Edition: current; Page: [1459] election,8 and all increased
my popularity. I am quite convinced that nothing more increases a man’s
influence than his having decided opinions of his own, and sticking to
them, provided he has got good reasons to give for them. No doubt, this
will give handle to his enemies to laugh at him, attack him, or abuse
him, as the case may be. But people’s enemies will always have something
to say against them; and those who side with you in some things are
delighted to see that you have the pluck to stand to your colours even
when they do not altogether agree with you. See how great has been the
influence of mere pluck, even in such a case as Roebuck’s;9 surely this
should be a lesson to men not to be afraid when they are sure they are
in the right. Working men, in particular, hate hesitation, and anything
approaching to smoothing away differences, and have so much of it from
Tories and Whigs that nothing makes them more sure that a man is what
they think “of the right sort” than his speaking and acting plainly and
decidedly with them when he is with them, and against them when he is
against them. I doubt whether my opposition to the ballot will cost a
single vote at Westminster, and I believe that what I have done in the
matter of Bradlaugh is likely to gain quite as many as it will lose;
although this had nothing whatever to do with my doing it. I am Dear
Chadwick

Dear Mr Bouverie

Though a great deal surprised I am far from dissatisfied at seeing our
correspondence up to this point in the papers, as I had not thought
myself at liberty to publish it without your previous consent.

Your observation that choosing the best man to be had “would be fatal to
the mutual confidence between represented & representative” is a
misanthropical sentiment which I shd scarcely have expected to hear from
you, since I can see no meaning in it unless it be that the
constituencies so seldom get a good man that they can scarcely ever be
expected to be faithful to the man they have got: I do not look upon the
matter from so cynical a point of view. It seems to me that in this as
in other matters in life the more particular people are in choosing, the
less likely they are to change their minds after they have chosen. In
the particular case also in which you deprecate inconstancy Edition:
current; Page: [1461] it would appear that the constituency of
K[ilmarnock] has been constant for the last five & twenty years, from
whence one may fairly infer that they made a very good choice 5 & 20
years ago. But 5 & 20 years & a new Reform Act make a great change in
men & in politics, & if the constituency of K makes as judicious a
choice now as it did when it last changed its representative, I
sincerely hope it will be 5 & 20 years before it changes again. Still,
with the fullest regard to the consideration due to past services, one
must admit that there ought to be some limit to it. You would not, I
presume, maintain that a seat in Parlt ought to be a seat for life,
unless the member has given some violent offence to the constituency.
The urgency of an infusion of new blood is as good a reason for making a
new choice, as dissatisfaction with an existing representative: & there
is no time at which giving the preference to a new candidate is so
little of a reflection on the former member as when a change has been
made in the Constitution, admitting new electors often much more
numerous than the old.

I am sorry that the occasions on which people have asked my advice or
help in their electioneering affairs should have caused me so often to
incur your disapprobation by expressing opinions so very different from
yours as to the sort of men that would be of most use in the H of C. But
I do not see that the fear of being disagreeable to one class of
candidates ought to prevent me from giving my opinion, when asked, in
favour of another class or that there is anything presumptuous either in
answering questions that are addressed to me, or in giving testimony
which I am told will be of use to those in whose favour it is given, &
which, if as you say it has no weight, will at least be innocuous to
their rivals.

I have no objection to receiving the advice you tender in the last
sentence of your letter,2 although I did not invite it by opening up any
communications between us. For my part I never presumed to give you any
advice, nor did I “incite” you to retire in Mr C[hadwick]’s favour,
because I had no idea that you were in the least likely to do so; I
merely, in reply to a communication from yourself, shewed how very
public spirited a proceeding I shd consider it if you did. I shd not
however have troubled you with this opinion if you had not been the
first to write to me.

Writing to yourself, what at the time I wrote it, I supposed was to be a
private letter, I did not think it necessary to raise the question how
far the present member for K. is entitled to claim the support of
liberals on the ground of fidelity to the liberal party. But to the
public or to the constituency Edition: current; Page: [1462] I have no
hesitation in saying that no untried man can be looked upon as less a
member of the liberal party than the man who at the beginning of this
present year, called the liberal party a rabble & declared that their
leader was incapable of leading.3 I do not know that any one is likely
to do more than this to sow dissension among the liberal party nor do I
see what possible claim this gentleman can have upon party fidelity, or
what pledge he can give his constituents that he will not at a critical
moment turn round again upon this same “leader who cannot lead” & shew
himself even more a conspicuous example of a “follower who will not
follow.” Whatsoever claims he may have upon his constituency can only be
those of his own individual personal merits; he is the last man who has
a right to the sympathy of his whilom party or who can appeal against me
on the ground of his high sense of the claims of party organisation.

Even in the most ordinary circumstances, the efficiency of
representatives can only be kept up by a keen rivalry, & a probability
that if they fall below the standard they have ever attained, their
constituents will look out for new men who come up to it. But we are not
now in ordinary times. There are not only new electors to be
represented, but new questions to be decided, requiring men deeply
impressed with the wants of the country, & who have exercised their
minds on the means of remedying the most pressing existing evils. The
liberal electors have a right to a choice between their present members
& any others who may seem to them better qualified in this respect &
such choice is denied them if it is regarded as treason against
liberalism for a new liberal candidate to offer himself in competition
with an old member.

I am keenly sensible of the importance of not dividing the liberal
party: but it is not a very hopeful way of keeping the party united, for
the representatives of the old electors to engross all the
representation, leaving none for the new: & if a reasonable number of
men of advanced opinions, or possessing the confidence of the working
classes, are not to be included among the recognised candidates of the
party, they cannot be blamed if they sometimes stand against those who
are. Just as we are often told that to secure the unity of a married
couple what is the man’s is his own, & what is the woman’s is the man’s,
so now we are being told every day that to secure the unity of the
liberal party which is threatened by a division between the old men &
the new, the old men should be represented by themselves, & the new men
by the old. With the solitary exception of the advice which you supposed
me to give to yourself, I have not heard of any instance in which it has
not been proposed to resolve the difficulty by the new men retiring, &
the old men magnanimously accepting their retirement. And this in many
cases is very naïvely put upon the ground that as the old men will not
consider the public interest & retire, for fear of letting in a Tory,
the new men must.

Edition: current; Page: [1463]
The real danger, in my opinion, of the liberal party, is not what you
consider it to be. It is in the renewal of the tactics which made the
last H of C a spectacle of dissension & want of principle, shewing us
representatives trying to slip out of the engagements their constituents
conceived them to be bound by, & others yielding a shameful obedience
when called to order by the dread of losing their seats, while in cases
where this powerful motive was not in operation, men elected under the
same banner proved by their conduct that there was as irreconcilable a
variance in their intentions & political feelings as if they had sat on
opposite sides of the House. What gave this deplorable character to the
last H of C was that its so called Liberal members were rallied under
the cry of supporting Palmerston, as we are now told they ought to be
rallied under the cry of disestablishing the Irish Church. Now, I am not
one of those who think that the political progress of England has but
one step more to make before reaching its summit, where it may rest & be
thankful, & that if a man is ready to vote for the disestablishment of
the Irish Church he is ready to do all that the staunchest liberalism
can demand of him. But I would remind those who differ with me as to the
all-sufficiency of this particular step, that our power to make even
that step next session may depend upon our getting men into the H. of C.
who are not merely certain to vote for that step, but who will follow
their leaders loyally through all the parliamentary tactics with which
our skilful opponent will try to impede the way. Days, weeks, & months
may be lost if Mr Gladstone’s majority is composed of men who will keep
their word in voting for the disestablishment of the Irish Church, but
will thwart & embarrass their leader in every previous step by which
that desirable consummation may have to be led up to. It was not the
Tories but the Adullamites,4 who weakened the liberal party in the last
parliament; & if a similar result should befall it in the next there
will be cause for bitter regret that the liberal party did not fight out
its battles at the polling booths rather than in the lobby of the H. of
C. There does not appear to be any danger that Mr G[ladstone]’s nominal
majority will not be greater than in the last Parlt. What the country
has to look to is that his majority shall be more steadfast to genuine
liberal principles. We do not want men who cast reluctant looks back to
the old order of things, nor men whose liberalism consists chiefly in a
warm adherence to all the liberal measures already passed, but men whose
heart & soul are in the cause of progress, & who are animated by that
ardour which in politics as in war kindles the commander to his highest
achievements & makes the army at his command worth twice its numbers;
men whose zeal will encourage their leader to attempt what their
fidelity will give him strength to do. It would be poor statesmanship to
gain a seeming victory at the poll by returning a majority numerically
large but composed of the same incompatible elements as the last; even
if we put political Edition: current; Page: [1464] principle aside &
look at nothing but the exigencies of the fight we are going to sustain
against a politician5 renowned for his skill in availing himself of the
disunion of his opponents.

I am yours very faithfully

Dear Sir—

I beg to acknowledge your letter of the 22nd inst. in behalf of Mr.
Howell’s London provisional committee, asking my opinion respecting his
candidature. It would give me much pleasure to see Mr. Howell returned
to Parliament. I look upon it as of great importance that the working
classes should be represented in the new House of Commons by persons
possessing their confidence, and that some of those persons should be
themselves working men; and, though my knowledge of Mr. Howell
personally is not great, what I have seen of his public conduct has made
me look upon him as one who, in point of opinions and abilities would be
a valuable representative of the working classes in Parliament.

Dear Mr Cairnes

It seems a long time since I heard from you, as well as since I wrote,
but Fawcett sent me some weeks ago a letter of yours to him. The report
of your Edition: current; Page: [1465] health, though in some respects
satisfactory, shewed less improvement in the local complaint than your
friends, and I suppose your medical men, had hoped for. I shall be very
much interested in having later intelligence.

How weary and sick you must be of the Irish Church and all that belongs
to it!2 The subject is sickening even to me, who have not been living in
the atmosphere of the abominable passions which self interest and
bigotry combined have kindled in those who will be losers in one way or
another when justice is done. I am impatient to see that worn out
subject dead and buried, that the public may get to the practical
interests of Ireland—landed tenure, and education. On both these, there
will be great battles to fight, and on the first, if not on both, they
will be long battles. The delay of the contest on Education has, I
think, thus far, been favourable to the right. There is a growing
feeling against Denominationalism in State education, by which Ireland
will benefit. I am glad to see the number of students in the Queen’s
Colleges has not fallen off as was expected. The abolition of Maynooth3
will greatly strengthen the argument for opening Trinity College. The
Catholics are quite right in saying that Maynooth is the counterpart of
that, and not of the Church Establishment.

The election prospects look very favourable, as far as regards the
largeness of Gladstone’s majority. You will have seen that I have
brought the newspapers upon me by doing my little possible in favour of
getting into that majority a small infusion of more useful elements. How
impossible this is, on the old plan of leaving everything to the party
managers, is shewn by the double failure of Mr Courtney’s candidature at
St Ives.4 I am much more attacked for helping Chadwick against Bouverie
(unfaithful as Bouverie has been to the Liberal party) than even for
subscribing to Bradlaugh;5 though the latter proceeding is the more
likely of the two to alienate voters in Westminster. All the opinions I
hear from my supporters about the prospects there, are favourable, but
their tone is not so confident as their words, and they have thought it
necessary to summon me, very much against my will, to spend the
fortnight before the elections in speaking at meetings. I shall
therefore be in England at the very beginning of November.

You will be as indignant as I am at the attempt to turn out Fawcett. The
only points on which he is attacked by Coningham6 and Coningham’s
supporters, are among his positive merits; his not jobbing for the
people of Edition: current; Page: [1466] Brighton; his supporting the
minority clause; and Coningham actually reproached him with wanting to
punish severely an elector who is bribed!

I hope some day to talk over with you the reasons pro and con about
abolishing Marriage Settlements. I have been reading Mr McDonnell’s
paper7 which you recommended to Fawcett. I quite agree with Mr McDonnell
about the bad consequences of making the eldest son sure of succeeding
independently of the will of the parents. But property might be settled
so that it could not be squandered, and yet the power of bequest
retained. In settlements on a wife and her children it is already common
to give her the power of distributing the property among the children by
will, and I do not see why property should not be settled on a person
for life, with power of bequest, but not of alienation inter vivos. The
great argument, however, for marriage settlements is the protection of
the wife. Mr McDonnell is willing that the wife’s own property should be
secured to her by settlement so long as the present law respecting the
property of married women is maintained. But the alteration required
would be much greater than merely not to deprive her of her ownership.
As long as she is at all in the husband’s power, she is liable to be
forced to surrender her rights. It would be necessary that she should
not be compellable to live with him; and that anything done by him which
would be unlawful if done to any other person, should be unlawful when
done to her. And there must be some just arrangement about the children
in case of separation. Until all this is accomplished I think it would
be a great aggravation of the dependent position of women to put an end
to settlements.

I hope all is now safe in America, as far as relates to the continuance
of the Republican party at the head of affairs,8 and without any
diminution of vigour in their councils. Since the ex-slaveholders are
incorrigible, it is a good thing that they cannot help shewing
themselves to be incorrigible. The danger of tampering with the rights
of the public creditor seems also to be blowing over. It certainly was
thought, at one time, to be serious. I was asked to write something on
Repudiation, in the form of a letter that could be published in the
Nation,9 and afterwards circulated in the broad sheets of the Loyal
Publication Society. I have done so, and it has just come back from
America, and is reprinted in last Wednesday’s Morning Star (October 28).
I hope if you see it you will approve of it, as I know you will of its
sentiments.

I should be delighted to hear from you. It will be best to write to
Blackheath until the election is over, after which, whether I am elected
or not, I shall return here.

Dear Sir

I have endeavoured, with such scanty means as are within my reach, to
obtain information on the matter on which you wrote to me on the 20th of
September. I have been unable to learn anything about the abbés
Blanchard2 and Dumas,3 but the Abbé Pézenas4 was a mathematician and
astronomer of distinction and professor of hyd[r]ography for the navy at
Marseilles, whence, when age obliged him to relinquish his
professorship, he returned to Avignon, his native place, and died there
in 1775. The only public library at Avignon contains an early work of
his, “Histoire critique de la découverte de la longitude.” The
Logarithmic Tables are not in that library, but there is a Monsieur
Bourges5 at Avignon who well remembers to have had them in his
possession. M. Bourges has a large collection of books in an unarranged
and confused state, but he has promised a friend of mine to search among
them for the work in question, which perhaps may still be found there.
There is a biographical notice of M. Pézenas in a dictionary in M.
Bourges’ possession, but it does not say anything of the Logarithmic
Tables, to which, as you mention, the editors did not put their names.
M. Pézenas also published a translation of a treatise on Fluxions
written in English by a mathematician with a French Edition: current;
Page: [1468] name,6 but I have not been able to learn if it was
Desclozeaux, or who else: probably you will know what book it must have
been.

Avignon, at the time mentioned, was a place of publication (or at least
printing) for all sorts of books which were published in France,
licentious books, &c. which were printed in cellars and secret places,
generally with extreme incorrectness: and a thing which stamped in M.
Bourges’ memory the recollection of the Tables, was the singularity of
the circumstance that a work requiring such punctilious exactness should
have been printed in such a place.

When I obtain any further information, I shall write to you again.

TO CHARLES FRIEND1

A[vignon]

Oct. 29. 1868

Dear Sir—

I beg to acknowledge your letter of the 26th inst.

Your difficulties & anxieties are such as the extreme imperfection of
our public arrangements for education (though I am happy to say they are
at last showing some signs of improvement) imposes on all parents who
are at once thoughtful & conscientious, especially when, as is the case
with the greater number, circumstances compel them to rely on others
than themselves for a great part of the education of their children.

In regard to religion, I do not think it right either oneself to teach,
or to allow any one else to teach one’s children, authoritatively,
anything whatever that one does not from the bottom of one’s heart & by
the clearest light of one’s reason, believe to be true. It seems to me
that to act otherwise on any pretext whatever, is little if at all short
of a crime against one’s children, Edition: current; Page: [1469]
against one’s fellow creatures in general, & against abstract truth in
whatever form it appears most sacred to one’s eyes. One has most
assuredly no right to incumber the reason & entangle the conscience of
one’s children, one has no right to send citizens out into the world to
play their various parts for or against their fellow creatures furnished
with anything less than the most honest truth that one can give them.
Nor can I see that the plea of worldly interest is the smallest valid
excuse, although I am well aware how many people think it so. But in the
first place he would be a wise man indeed who can foresee the state of
society 15 or 20 years hence. In the second place the clear intellect &
the sturdy conscience which are acquired in a household where truth is
reverenced above all things are as valuable to men & women pushing their
way in the world as any supposed conformity with popular prejudice. In
the third place, if there is one thing to which we all ought to give our
allegiance irrespective of consequence it is truth, & here I look upon
the ancient Christian teaching as the highest the world has yet known, &
shd regard it as a misfortune indeed if this noble spirit were to die
out with the prejudices which have overlaid it. But I do not believe it
will, & the immense value attached to worldly prosperity by the bulk of
so-called Xtians is to me the best proof that their doctrine is hollow &
effete.

But I do not think that there shd be any authoritative teaching at all
on such subjects. I think parents ought to point out to their children
when the children begin to question them, or to make observations of
their own, the various opinions on such subjects, & what the parents
themselves think the most powerful reasons for & against. Then, if the
parents show a strong feeling of the importance of truth, & also of the
difficulty of attaining it, it seems to me that young people’s minds
will be sufficiently prepared to regard popular opinion or the opinions
of those about them with respectful tolerance, & may be safely left to
form definite conclusions in the course of mature life.

There is one other point in which a mother may I believe be of immense
use to her children, which is apt to be too much overlooked in my
opinion in modern education, but on which there is a great deal of good
sense in Miss Edgeworth’s stories for children,2 in Sandford & Merton,3
& in Miss Martineau’s Household Education:4 & this is, teaching children
(more especially if they are not going to be rich) to respect, to enjoy,
& habitually to practise manual and domestic labour. The love of this, &
the sense of moral dignity in doing it, are, next to the love of truth,
the very most valuable possessions with which to begin life, whether we
consider happiness or the power of getting on.

Edition: current; Page: [1470]
To cultivate the intelligence, nothing perhaps is of so much value as a
love of reading: & to secure this, it is essential to let young people
read whatever they may come across & are disposed to read. Moreover, if
careful selections are to be made for them, it becomes a most
embarrassing question at what age are they to begin to be allowed to
know any of the realities of life? & in many respects such knowledge is
likely to be more mischievous if it comes startlingly upon them when
they are of an age to understand it than if it is taken for granted in
what they read when it has no particular interest for their childish
minds.

I know of no schools so good as the Birkbeck schools5 & if there is one
within reach I should think both boys & girls could receive an excellent
education at it. I do not know precisely up to what point the education
is carried on at them, nor what amount of education you contemplate
giving to your children. I imagine that some of the best education to be
had now, of a more advanced sort, at no great expense, is to be had by
following the classes at the Working Men’s College,6 or at one of the
Scotch universities. Either of these however are of course not for
children, but I believe that the Birkbeck school would be a fit
preparation for either of these. You are no doubt quite aware that I
think it a duty to give girls as solid an education as boys, & doubly so
if they are likely to have to earn their own living: & the progress now
making in the education of girls is so considerable that it is not
likely that 20 years hence any young woman will be able to earn by
teaching who has not some solid instruction herself.

Dear Chadwick

I am much obliged to you for your bulletins of progress. It is a
thousand pities that your path should be crossed by a mad parson;2 and
that there should be another working men’s candidate in the field,3 with
power to take Edition: current; Page: [1471] away votes from you, though
without any chance for himself. If he can be induced to withdraw, it
must be by the influence of working class opinion in the boroughs
themselves. I wrote very strongly to Beales4 from whom I have had no
answer: but the London chiefs of the League have probably little
influence in the localities.

By publishing the correspondence,5 Bouverie did me a favour which he did
not intend, by compelling me to do what would have been an impertinence
if I had done it uncompelled—to put forth a manifesto on the necessity
of bringing in new men in the place of some of the old. The reply
appears to have produced a considerable effect, and seems likely to act
on the electors even more than on the talking and writing public. The
Times, though obliged to take notice of it, got off with the fewest
words it could; and most spiteful words they were.6 The spite of the
newspaper writers is partly against you, for getting more praise than
they like you to have; partly (as the Daily News remarked7) against me,
because they are angry at finding that my words have influence. One
would suppose that giving a recommendatory letter to a candidate had
never been heard of before, instead of being quite in the common course.
The Glasgow paper you sent, mentioned Disraeli’s recommendatory letters
to Wycombe.8 It might have added that Roebuck in 1832 went to Bath with
a recommendation from Hume. How else are new men to make themselves
known? This sort of cant is intended to keep all influence a monopoly in
the hands of residents.

I have just received a letter from a surgeon in West Cornwall,9 saying
that a candidate is very much wanted for that division of the county,
that he would undertake within ten days to get up a numerously signed
requisition to any man of mark, asking whether I can prevail upon you to
go down, and saying “There would not be any doubt about his” (your)
“return if he came among us. Those already in the field are of no
account whatever.”

I sent you by yesterday’s post a number of Le Temps,10 containing a
letter by Louis Blanc on the Bouverie correspondence, where you will see
in what high terms he speaks of you.

TO FLORENCE MAY1

[Before
November? 1868

]

Dear Madam—

I am very glad to find that you enjoy Buckle’s History, & I suppose from
what you say, that you would like to enter into a course of reading that
would be a good preparation for historical & social philosophy.

Something must depend in this course on the number of hours you can give
to reading every day, & on the quickness with which you are in the habit
of reading. But in any case I would strongly recommend three things.
First, to read every book (with few & special exceptions) straight
through from the title page to the last word. 2. To read a fixed number
of pages of such reading as is taken for work, every day. I do not
recommend hours, but 20, 50, or 100 pages. To read the working reading
of the day as early as circumstances will admit in the day: but never,
unless on some very rare exceptions, to go to sleep without having read
it. 3. To fix so small a quantity of reading for work, as shall never be
a burden, nor weary the mind, nor interfere inconveniently with other
occupations; & to fill in the many gaps of time which will be left
unoccupied by this rule, with light reading, amusing & agreeable, which
has the advantage of being attractive when you are tired, of being able
to put aside for days together when you are otherwise occupied, & which
at the same time if well chosen may end by filling the mind with a fund
of valuable knowledge as to the habits & ideas of past times & foreign
countries.

I recommend, therefore, dividing your reading into four courses, which
shd be carried on simultaneously: the first two of them to consist of
books, some small portion of which shd be read invariably every day, &
every word of which shd be read steadily through. The third course shd
consist of books from which you can select portions if you like, which
are comparatively light reading, but which shd be read because they are
standard books the knowledge Edition: current; Page: [1473] of which is
necessary to any thorough knowledge of the progress of the human mind &
of the history of manners. These need not be read every day if time is
wanting, yet it might be a good rule to read some of them every day
whenever there is time before taking up the still lighter or more
exciting literature of the 4th course.

The fourth course shd consist of those chefs d’œuvre of literature which
are sure to be interesting, as well as of whatever modern books you find
tempting & agreeable without fatiguing the mind. For I think it of great
value to acquire a habit of constant reading in order to acquire in time
the power of reading quickly, & I am convinced that this cannot be done
with safety to the health of those who eschew light literature. To those
who mean to spend their life in study, light literature is a necessary
relief, while as I have already said, it is by no means without good
results. I think that in it newspapers magazines & reviews may be very
usefully included, if you find them agreeable reading; but even the most
valuable articles in periodical publications ought to be read for
pleasure, & not as part of the work of the day, because they do not fit
in to a steady course of reading.

I inclose a list of books for the four courses, which I have put in the
order in which I think it would be good to read them. The first course
shd have the freshest part of the day, as it requires thought; & the two
first courses shd if possible be read in the order in which I have put
them down. The last two need not necessarily be read in this order, but
it is very desirable that in reading them you shd ascertain & [note in?]
your own mind while reading, the date at which they were written, so as
to observe as you read the changes of ideas & manners.

I have not put down any books in any foreign language, because unless
there is any foreign language you read with as much pleasure & fluency
as English, I think it waste of time at present to read its literature.
But if there is any such language, it would be well to let me know,
because in that case I could perhaps point out useful books in each
course to read in it, supplying some want which cannot be supplied in
English.

The grounds of the claim for the admission of women to the Suffrage are

Dear Chadwick

I have written at once to my correspondent, Geo. Gill Esq. Zion House,
Marazion,2 with whom you will no doubt wish to correspond directly. It
will be best to say nothing of the matter in any public manner for the
present, so that the initiative may come entirely from the Cornish
constituency. I hardly think that in a county, a requisition could be
obtained from anything approaching to a majority of the electors; at all
events not without great expense and loss of time. But of this you will
judge better after further communication with Mr Gill. Meanwhile I send
you his letter, that you may know what are the opinions which he himself
wishes the member for West Cornwall to hold on matters interesting to
the locality. Some of them are not the most enlightened; but the main
points are such as you could take up and work with great effect. It is
the cause of working miners against mine-owners.

Dear Sir—

As a good opportunity did not present itself at the meeting yesterday
evening2 for answering your questions, I now answer them by letter.

The first question you ask raises a difficulty which will exist at
whatever sum we fix the limit to the Income Tax: for whether the tax
begins at £100 at £200 or at £500, that sum will represent a larger real
means of support in some places than in others. But I am very much
disposed to think that the limit of £100 is too low; and that it would
be an improvement to make the income tax begin at £150 (as it did at
first), if not higher. If all taxation were direct, it ought to come
down to the limit of income just sufficient for the necessaries of life,
& everyone ought to pay in proportion to the surplus of the income he
possesses beyond those mere necessaries. But so long as the larger part
of our revenue is raised by indirect taxation on articles of almost
universal consumption, & of which the poor consume more, in proportion
to their small means than the rich, so long I think that the incomes
between £50 and £150 or £200 pay more than their fair share of indirect
taxation, & this requires to be made up to them by levying a tax on the
higher incomes, from which they should be exempt.

In answer to your second question, my opinion is that in justice the
same amount of income should pay the same amount of tax, whether it be a
fixed annual income or a variable sum paid weekly. But it would be
extremely difficult to check fraudulent concealment of income in the
latter case.

Dear Sir—

In answer to your letter dated yesterday, I beg to say that Mr Edition:
current; Page: [1478] Gilpin2 is a distinguished and valuable member of
the advanced Liberal party, no opposition to whom I shd for a moment
countenance, & that Lord Henley has always been faithful, & I have no
reason whatever to doubt that he will remain faithful to the party & to
Mr. Gladstone. In subscribing, therefore, towards the expenses of
another candidate, I was not influenced by any hostility to either of
the present members. The motive by which I was actuated was a strong
sense, that the working classes have a just claim to a fair number of
the men of their choice in the reformed H. of Commons, which fair share,
I regret to say, there is from present appearances extremely little
prospect of their obtaining. I am also of opinion, & in this I hope you
will agree with me that the Liberal electors have a right to be allowed
to decide which among any number of candidates who are willing to offer
themselves, they prefer to be represented by. After they have had time
to weigh the pretensions of the various candidates & to make up their
minds whom they intend to support then if a Tory has offered himself, &
the division among Liberals renders at all probable his return, my
opinion is, that some means should be adopted of deciding which two of
the Liberal candidates are the strongest,3 & that the remainder should
withdraw. I may add that Mr. Bradlaugh is aware that this is my opinion.

Dear Sir—

When I was first proposed as a candidate for the representation of
Westminster, an attempt was made to raise the same religious cry against
me,2 which you inform me, is now being repeated. But I publicly
announced my determination, on principle, to answer no questions
respecting my religious belief, because I would not give any
encouragement to a practice the effect of which would be that when no
objection could be made to a candidate either on the ground of character
or of political opinions, his opponents would endeavour to extract from
himself materials for raising a religious prejudice against him. You
will, I hope, pardon me for adhering to the resolution I then declared.
But if there really are persons who, in good faith & honesty, conclude
me to be an atheist because I subscribed to the Edition: current; Page:
[1479] fund for the election of Mr Bradlaugh,3 such persons merely shew
that they are ignorant or regardless of the principles I have openly
proclaimed especially in my book on Liberty,4 viz that atheists as well
as the professors of any, even the worst religions, may be & often are,
good men, estimable & valuable in all the relations of life, & are
entitled like all other persons to be judged by their actions (“By their
fruits ye shall know them” are the words of Christ)5 & not by their
speculative opinions. My subscription was not given for Mr B as an
atheist but for Mr B as a politician; just as we may presume that the
working men of Northampton selected him as their candidate,6 & the
Reform League as a member of its Council not as an atheist, but as a
politician.7

About the expense of elections and the difficulty of getting working

yesterday,2 but it was not reported. I take every opportunity I can of
dwelling on this great evil, both in speaking and in my correspondence.

Dear Sir,—

It is quite true that my answer to the question,2 about the Permissive
Bill3 was very inadequate, but it did not pretend to be adequate; it was
only intended to give a general notion of the kind of objection I have
to the Bill—viz., that the use or non use of alcoholic liquors is a
subject on which every sane and grown-up person ought to judge for
himself under his own responsibility, and that interference with that
private responsibility from known good motives, and with however much
apparent justification is not, in my eyes, made allowable by the fact of
its being sanctioned by the vote of the majority.

My reason for not accepting the proposal of an interview4 was merely
that, each side being already well aware of what the other side has to
say, it was probable that any oral discussion would be lost time. For
the same reason I hope you will excuse me from replying to the arguments
in your letter. But I will not conclude without saying that a much
better licensing system might easily be had than that of leaving all to
the discretion of the magistrates, and that I should not necessarily be
opposed to any proposal on the subject because it might involve ‘a
reduction in the number of drinking-shops.’ This, of course, does not
affect my opposition to a Bill for allowing a two-thirds majority in a
locality the power of prohibiting the sale of alcoholic liquors.

Allow me, at the same time, to say that I have never expressed myself
otherwise than most respectfully concerning the intentions of those who
support the Bill, and the great moral value of the end they pursue.

I am, dear Sir, very faithfully yours,

only good report that I saw was in the Telegraph.5 All have been
immensely successful.

Pratten,6 one of my local chairmen, says it is all nonsense employing
paid agents for election purposes, and that the whole thing is much
better managed by the local committees. Even at the registration, he
says, the thing would have been boshed if it had been left to the

I send a note from Miss Shirreff3 which is important.

I saw what seemed a superior custom house officer, who said that nothing
whatever is necessary but to sign a declaration, when bringing the plate
from Edition: current; Page: [1482] the Continent, that I have not
received any drawback upon it: and that the form of declaration is kept
at the Charing Cross custom house. I told him what the officer there had
told us the last time: he said he still did not understand how that can
have been said but that I may absolutely depend on nothing being
necessary but to sign the declaration, & that no paper from the Custom

During our short conversation the other evening, I had not time to speak
to you about the Wolverhampton Plate Lock Cooperative Association.2 The
Secretary of the Association wrote to me at Avignon that they were in
difficulties, which threatened their existence, but that the state of
their affairs was such as would justify the friends of cooperation in
making advances to them, and that they had placed a statement in your
hands. I told them in reply that I would when I had an opportunity,
consult with you on the subject. I know how your time must be filled up,
between your Lectures and your election work, but if at any casual
moment you could briefly give me your opinion as to the state of their
affairs, and as to whether anything can be done, or should be done, to
help them, it would enable me to give them an answer. It is but little
that I could in any case do to aid them, but even a little is sometimes
useful: it is however an unthrifty mode of using one’s means of doing
good, Edition: current; Page: [1483] to bolster up particular
experiments of social improvement, if they have not in themselves the
conditions of success.

I return Cairnes’ letter which you kindly sent to Avignon. It formed the
ground of a long letter which I afterwards wrote to him,3 but which I do
not know if he ever received. Perhaps you can tell me whether he has yet
gone to Nice, and some more recent news of his health.

I suppose the persons who call me an Atheist are the same who are
impudently asserting that Mr Gladstone is a Roman Catholic. I shd think
my friends in W[estminster] must by this time be aware that Tories, in
election times, stick at nothing. An attempt was made to raise the same
cry against me at my first election, & the defence which I did not
choose to make for myself was made for me by several eminent dignitaries
of the C[hurch] of England.2 At that time I declared my deliberate
determination, on principle, not to answer any questions whatever
respecting my religious creed, because I acknowledge no right in any one
to ask them, and because I owe it to future candidates & to the interest
of future constituencies not to encourage a practice, the effect of
which would be that when no objection can be found to a candidate’s
character or political opinions, attempts would be made to extract from
himself materials for raising a religious prejudice against him, which
is often easiest stirred up against the best men. I think I shall act
most rightly, & most in conformity to my principles by adhering to this
declaration. If any one again tells you that I am an atheist, I would
advise you to ask him, how he knows and in what page of my numerous
writings he finds anything to bear out the assertion. You will find that
he has Edition: current; Page: [1484] nothing at all to say. If he talks
about my subscription for Mr Bradlaugh, he shd be asked whether he
thinks that the working men of Northampton who adopted Mr B. as their
candidate, or the members of the Reform League who elected him one of
their Council, are all atheists.3 You are free to make any use you

I greatly regret that the onerous engagements connected with my own

nearer at hand, & not less important to the public interest than even
yours put it out of my power to go down to Warwick & give you my
personal assistance there.2

Edition: current; Page: [1485]
I have long felt, & I expressed the feeling on the second reading of Mr
Gladstone’s reform bill in 1866, that one of the most desirable
consequences of parly reform would be the presence in the H. of C. of
some of the élite of the working classes. It is not for the sake of
class interests that I desire this. Class legislation for the working
classes is as much to be deprecated as class legislation for any other
class. But the most numerous of all classes ought not to be without,
what every other class has—representatives in Parlt who can speak from
their own knowledge of the wants, the grievances, and the modes of
thought & feeling of their class—of all which, Parliament ought to be
fully informed, to enable it to legislate wisely and justly not for
class interests but for the general interest; & no other persons however
deservedly trusted by the working classes can speak on these subjects
with either the same knowledge or the same authority as those who, being
in other respects qualified, are themselves working men. I regret that
so few working men have offered themselves as candidates at the present
general election; & that one of the ablest & worthiest of them3 has had
to retire from Chelsea in order not to risk the return of the Tory
candidate.4 I am the more desirous on that account that a man like
yourself, who possesses, & as I believe, fully deserves the confidence
of a large & intelligent portion of the working classes, should succeed
in his candidature. The importance of the contest is still further
increased by the fact that your competitor is a Tory,5 who will vote
against Mr Gladstone & in support of that great & old standing iniquity,
the Irish Church Establishment.

Dear Mrs Chadwick—

I have been unable earlier to acknowledge your reproachful & you must
excuse me for saying, I think unreasonable letter. You appear to
consider me as the adviser & instigator, & sole cause of Mr Chadwick’s
offering himself as a candidate for the H. of Commons. I however have
been aware that to be elected to Parlt. has been a strong desire of his
for a great number of years, & one which he was almost certain to act
upon, believing as he does on very good grounds that his public
usefulness would be in an extraordinary degree increased by a seat in
Parlt. Being in the habit of considering Mr C. to be a competent judge
of his own affairs I by no means thought myself called on to dissuade
him from the attempt, & when he had undertaken it of himself, & not by
any advice of mine, I felt it my duty to give him all the help that
could be given by my strongest testimony in his favour.

I regret to find that you do not support Mr C in a matter in which I am
sure your encouragement would give him so much pleasure. One of the
grounds of my high respect for Mr C has always been his willingness to
[postpone?] private interests to public; & sympathy in his own home in
such a willingness is the best source of repose & strength that a man
can find. Of course you are a better judge than I am of what may or not
be prudent in Mr C. to do in the matter of expense; but for this very
reason I shd never dream of presuming to give him advice on such a

best judge except himself.

Dear Madam—

Mr Bradlaugh is a man who has been guilty of the very great fault of
using insulting language towards those who differ from him in religious
opinions: a fault which he appears to share with your friend the
clergyman who calls Mr B “the prince of scoundrels” in a country
abounding in murderers, thieves, &c., &c. I am not aware that any
accusations are made against Mr B’s moral character while I am quite
certain that no such accusations could be substantiated, as if they
could they would have been brought forward against him in the bitterness
of the recently contested elections.2 The violence of the language which
has been made use of by Mr B has been very greatly exaggerated by his
opponents, & I believe that it was in his younger days that he made use
of it but at the same time I have no excuse to offer for that. I myself
know nothing of him except that he has put himself very boldly forward
to advocate with considerable ability a great number of unpopular
opinions; some of them unpopular among the upper classes, such as
religious scepticism & democracy, others unpopular among working men,
such as representation of minorities & the equality of women. If you
will do me the honour to read my little book on Liberty, you will at
once understand why I think such men as Mr B ought to be allowed to say
what they have got to say, & not be abused for their opinions so long as
they do nothing wrong.

I cannot easily express to you, & I will not take the trouble to try to
express, the contempt I feel for a man who calling himself a Xtian can
call another man the prince of scoundrels because of differences on
religious opinion. If Mr B is wrong, a clergyman ought to be the first
to pity him, the first also to recognise with humility that men with
such opinions as Mr B can behave honourably & uprightly while men who
call themselves Xtians are daily guilty of any crime against the laws of
their country, of religion, & of the human conscience. Let such
clergymen apply themselves to the improvement of their own flocks, &
they will have neither time nor energy to spare for abusive language.

TO CHARLES ELIOT NORTON1

Dear Mr Norton

If you do not leave England early in the spring, we may still have an
opportunity of meeting, as, although I shall not hurry away from here as
I have been obliged to do when in Parliament, while the weather is still
wintry in England, I shall be at Blackheath, most likely, in the course
of the month of March. My absence from the House of Commons is
personally a very great relief to me, and therefore I have declined the
invitations I have received to stand elsewhere. I accepted the
invitation made to me three years ago, partly because of the reproach
which has often been made against the literary men of America, that they
would not enter into political life; a reproach, however, which I do not
think well founded. Moreover, there were at that time some points which
I thought could be usefully brought before the public through the House
of Commons. Nor were the relations of America and England so settled
then as now. At present I am very glad to be free from parliamentary
work, much of which is a great waste of time, more especially during the
height of the violent party contest on such a point as the Irish Church,
the final result of which does not admit of a doubt, and yet which will
cause a deplorable waste of time and energy. There are always periods of
this sort in the practical working of politics, when those whose taste
or talent lies rather in principles than in details can be of more use
in literary than in political life.

I regret the defeat of the radical party throughout the country.2 It
seems to have been owing to the want of organisation on their side, and
to the great expenditure of money on that of our opponents. It remains
to be seen, and I cannot venture to predict, how far our friends will be
discouraged by the result. Those with whom I am myself in communication
seem to be stimulated rather to more efforts; but perhaps they may be
the most energetic among us. It is in any case satisfactory to find that
if these elections have been carried by money, there is at all events so
much money on the moderate liberal side; since after all, as a question
between Gladstone and Disraeli, Gladstone is triumphant. When we
consider how slow the English mind is to move, we must look upon this as
a success, and trust to the Press to prepare the way for more progress
hereafter. I am

TO LORD AMBERLEY1

Avignon

Nov. 30. 1868

Dear Lord Amberley

I regret exceedingly to hear today by the papers I have just received,
that your contest has been unsuccessful.2 Had you been in the House this
session, you would have been one of the exceedingly few men there in
whom I should have felt thorough confidence; and there are some points,
such as that of religious liberty, which you alone are willing to work.
Your conduct on this matter has been so brave and generous that it will
infallibly bear good fruit in the future. I see that the Times (model of
piety!) snarls at you,3 as the Daily News did at me!4 but these snarls
are the best testimony that one is doing work which really requires to
be done, and which all the world is not ready to do.

I deferred writing, in the hope, growing slighter however from day to
day as I saw how persistently the elections continued in one direction,
that I might be able to congratulate you on a success at the same time
that I thanked you for your kind letter on my defeat. I should myself be
so far from willing to accept your kind suggestion5 [? as to say] that
you are the candidate whom I should like to see for Westminster. If you
have family influence there, I am sure the present state of affairs
might remove all scruple in using it: and you are certainly the only man
who could have, who would be really welcome to the advanced Liberals. I
am recommending to them to make up their minds about their next
candidate and set things in hand at once; I confess that though not
mortified at present, I should be mortified if a Tory continues to
represent Westminster,6 unless indeed it should turn out that the Tories
have a fair and genuine majority there, which I do not expect.

The result of the elections seems to justify the opinion of those who
said Edition: current; Page: [1495] that these elections would go by
money. It is satisfactory, from this point of view, that there is so
much money in the country read to stand by Gladstone. In some respects
your defeat is, like my own, less a subject of regret to me than some
others, because you have it in your power to use influences in other
ways, and do not, I believe, personally find pleasure in the life of the
House of Commons. Some of the reasons which made me most wish to see Mr
Chadwick in the House do not apply to us. Mr Chadwick’s age and health
do not give good promise for the future; he does not do justice to his
ideas by the pen; and I believe he would personally like to be in the
House.

I have no idea whatever of taking advantage of any opportunities that
might present themselves of going into the House this session. I expect
that it will be so much given up to the Irish Church debates that to me
it would be particularly wearisome, for I do not think that anything I
could say on the subject would have the slightest effect, since any one
who would be amenable to any reasoning of mine must have made up his
mind long ago. I hope I may not think it necessary to accept any future
invitations to enter the House—I feel tolerably sure I shall not, until
the time has come for pushing forward more advanced topics than are on
the tapis there for the present. I am glad to have been in for the
little time I was, as some of the questions I most wish to see discussed
out of the House have been in some measure popularized by what I was
able to do in it.

With our kind regards to Lady Amberley

TO ALPHONSE ESQUIROS1

[
December, 1868

]

Cher Monsieur,—

Je crois que les causes de mon insuccès à Westminster se réduisent
principalement à trois:—1o, une grande supériorité d’organisation et
d’habilité dans le parti opposé, les opérations dirigées par un homme
d’affaires dans son propre intérêt étant ordinairement mieux conduites
que celles qui dépendent d’un comité d’amateurs; 2o, une très grande
Edition: current; Page: [1496] abondance d’argent du côté opposé, tandis
que du nôtre il y avait à peine le strict nécessaire; 3o, l’hostilité de
presque tous les vestrymen et autres notabilités locales qui sont les
chefs ordinaires de l’action politique dans les localités, et à qui j’ai
fortement déplu par la proposition que j’ai faite d’une meilleure
constitution municipale.

Plusieurs autres circonstances sont venues se joindre à celles-là, mais
je crois que celles que j’ai signalées sont les seules réellement
importantes, et qu’elles auraient suffi pour empêcher ma réélection. Du
reste, sauf l’échec porté par ma défaite au parti libéral avancé, qui
d’ailleurs a tant souffert dans ces élections-ci, je n’ai rien à
regretter. J’espère exercer en faveur de mes opinions une activité tout
aussi grande, et beaucoup plus agréable pour moi, comme écrivain que
comme député au parlement.

L’échec essuyé par notre parti (l’extrême gauche pour ainsi dire de
l’Angleterre—le parti radical) est beaucoup plus à regretter et moins
facile à expliquer, que le mien. Cependant il a été prévu comme vous le
savez, par notre ami M. John Morley;2 et lui, avec beaucoup d’autres
personnes qui sont dans le cas d’en bien juger, semble croire que c’est
tout simplement affaie d’argent. Vous savez qu’un million a été retiré
de la Banque dans la semaine avant les élections; et la prédominance des
hommes d’argent a été tellement remarquable que le Standard même a fait
l’observation que peut-être l’insuccès des hommes de talent et des
jeunes hommes est dû tout simplement à ce que ni les uns ni les autres
ne sont ordinairement des hommes riches.

Non seulement l’argent a été employé pour la corruption sur une echelle
déplorable, mais encore, dans un pays comme le nôtre, tellement porté à
respecter la fortune et la position sociale, l’influence qu’on peut
appeler légitime de la fortune est extrêmement grande. Plus encore que
tout cela, il y a une raison qui explique la grande importance de
l’argent dans les élections chez nous, et surtout dans ces dernières
élections, et cela est la lenteur de l’intelligence britannique qui a
grand besoin d’être aiguillonnée par tous les moyens possibles avant
qu’elle se décide à se mouvoir. Ces moyens tels que le canvass d’une
maison à l’autre, les circulaires imprimées, les comités dans chaque
paroisse, les dépenses de la registration même, et aussi des réunions
publiques, demandent beaucoup d’argent. Plus il y a d’argent et mieux
tout cela est organisé. Les classes ouvrières n’ont pas encore des
organisations Edition: current; Page: [1497] électorales assez
importantes. Il n’y a pas encore eu le temps. La Reform League a fait
son possible, et cela a été bien peu. L’expérience apprendra aux hommes
d’élite de la classe ouvrière ce qu’il y a à faire, et tôt ou tard on le
fera.

Puis on a regardé ces élections un peu comme un duel entre M. Gladstone
et M. Disraeli: et beaucoup ont cru qu’il suffisait d’envoyer au
parlement un fidèle adhérent du premier et que cela était de la première
urgence. Vous savez combien le peuple est souvent sujet à se laisser
prendre par une seule idée; idée juste au fond, mais à laquelle on donne
plus d’importance relative que peut-être elle ne mérite.

Ces dernières raisons ne s’appliquent pas à ma défaite, qui a été au
profit d’un Tory. Mais celle-là je crois, comme je l’ai dit, était
plutôt une question d’argent que de toute autre chose. . . . Je n’ai que
trop à me louer de zèle et de l’enthousiasme avec lesquels j’ai été
appuyé; mais, pas plus en Angleterre qu’ailleurs, le zèle et
l’enthousiasme ne peuvent toujours lutter victorieusement contre
l’intérêt. En fin de compte, nous pouvons nous réjouir que dans une
lutte d’argent comme les dernières élections, il se soit trouvé assez
d’argent et d’intérêts matériels prêts de se ranger du côté de la raison
et de la justice pour donner la victoire à Mr. Gladstone et à
l’abolition des privilèges de l’église protestante en Irlande. C’est
déjà beaucoup, et bien fait pour nous encourager, quoique notre progrès
soit lent.

Agréez, cher Monsieur, l’expression de mes sentiments de respect et
d’amitié.

TO THOMAS DYKE ACLAND1

Avignon

Dec.1. 1868

Dear Mr Acland—

There are few if any of my friends in the H. of C. from whom such an
expression of good opinion and of kind & friendly feeling as your letter
contains, would have given me greater pleasure. I have been in strong
sympathy with you on most or all of the subjects in which you have shewn
a special interest during the time I was in the House, & I am heartily
glad that you are still there to continue working for them.

Among those subjects, that of the most just & fair mode of raising taxes
for local purposes is one of the most difficult & puzzling. It is quite
true that Lopes2 was playing, to a great extent, a landlord’s game, & in
my speech on his motion3 I contended that the peculiar pressure of the
local rates on the rent of land was, as to a considerable part of it,
just. At the same time, I believe we (you & I) agree in thinking that
money is wanted for important local purposes now neglected or
insufficiently provided for; that the difficulty of putting further
pressure on the ratepayers is at present a serious obstacle to important
public objects; & that the pecuniary resources required will have to be
sought, entirely or partially, at the expense of kinds of property &
income which now, in the main, escape from local rates. Your suggestion
of transferring the assessed Taxes wholly or partially to local
purposes, amounts in fact to allowing taxes on male servants, & on
horses and carriages in aid of local rates; for the house tax falls
entirely on the present ratepayers & the minor assessed taxes are not
worth taking into account. I do not think that taxes on male servants or
on horses & carriages not employed in business, are at all objectionable
on grounds of political economy. They are fair taxes on luxuries, & the
luxuries of all classes are fit objects of taxation. E contra, I would
not tax any kind of public conveyance: post-horses, stage coaches,
railways, &c, nor horses or carts used in trades; nor perhaps the
carriage of a medical man; & even a private carriage is, to many persons
in weak health, a luxury so nearly amounting to a necessary, that I
would tax the first carriage much more lightly than the second or any
greater number. And the same reason applies in some circumstances to the
first man-servant. It must Edition: current; Page: [1499] be remembered
in abatement from the efficacy of such taxes, in affording relief to the
rates, that they would be, in a large proportion, paid by the same
persons. But falling impartially on all who expend large incomes in the
ordinary way, they would be in themselves a mode of raising money
unobjectionable as to fairness.

What you say about the growing intelligence of the yeomen & the younger
tenant farmers is one of the most gratifying things I have heard for a
long time. If that improvement is general in the rural districts,
political & social progress are safe even where the obstacles to them
are strongest.

What you say of the possibility of reaction arising from religious
feeling is very true, & it has long been a subject of grief to me that
those feelings of religion which belong to the best parts of human
nature shd not only be turned to mischief by their association with
dogmas confusing to the intellect & very often, I am sorry to say,
perverting the moral sense, but that also they shd actually be
themselves the cause of dissension between the very persons who are most
deeply imbued with them; those who feel them most strongly disliking
most just those who also feel them most strongly, with whom they ought
to be the firmest allies. Thus the most genuinely pious among the
Catholics are often the most bitter against the Protestants, those among
the C[hurch] of E[ngland] against Dissenters, those among the Dissenters
against Deists &c &c. This is comparatively speaking an old evil, & one
which it is comparatively difficult to remove, because when people hold
very strongly particular dogmas it is natural that they shd specially
dislike those who hold with equal intensity to other dogmas specifically
contradictory to their own.

But I have long thought that what we now want in the present stage of
the world is a union among all those men (& women) who are deeply
impressed with the fundamental essence of religion, in so far as
religion affects this world. To you I need scarcely point out that the
special characteristic of Xtianity as opposed to most other religions is
that it insists that religion does affect this world; making charity to
our fellow-creatures & good actions the criterion of a good man. Now
this is also the fundamental doctrine of those who are called Atheists
as well as of those whose religious opinions are founded on individual
convictions & are not therefore altogether in accordance with any of the
sects. Honesty, self sacrifice, love of our fellow-creatures, & the
desire to be of use in the world, constitute the true point of
resemblance between those whose religion however overlaid with dogmas is
genuine, & those who are genuinely religious without any dogmas at all.
I have often been amazed that there are not more Xtians who perceive
that Xtianity (I do not myself think however that any Xtian sect comes
up to this ideal) forms a point of union for all men in this point of
view. Now if those men who from any peculiarities of mental
constitution—whether superiority or inferiority to the general
average—find themselves unable to accept any dogmatic religion Edition:
current; Page: [1500] whatever, not even the dogmas of natural religion,
are to continue to wrap up their doubts in mystery, to be afraid to
speak out, & to be the object of abuse whenever they do, a strong
premium is put upon dishonesty on their part, & those among them who
have a great deal of natural energy of character are drawn into a
violence of language which hurts the feelings of other people & arouses
in themselves something of that very intolerance from which they are
sufferers. They are led to speak without respect & without tolerance of
the religious convictions they do not share. In doing so they excite
just resentment on the part of genuinely religious people, who would be
the best qualified to sympathise in their honesty & disinterestedness, &
those who really profit by the result are the hypocrites of all parties.
Those who make religion a matter of worldly success & profit take care
to draw the moral from all this that if a man once gives up the formal
dogmas there can be no unison of feeling between him & pious men; those
who have not a trace of religious feeling or religious conviction of any
kind whatever but who have not the smallest wish to sacrifice a particle
of worldly consequence & success are confirmed in the opinion that if
they allowed the world in general to know the true state of their mind
on religious matters they would become objects of opprobrium & deep
seated dislike such as they see the outspoken men of their own opinions
to be.

Now you will see how all this applies to Bradlaugh.4 Few people feel
more dislike than I do to anybody who can use insulting expressions to
that which excites the respect of their fellow creatures, or who treats
with ingratitude those influences to which the world owes so much. A
tender respect for every worthy & pious feeling, & a pious tenderness
towards the past, constitute to my mind important elements of the
religious character without which no character can be complete or
altogether worthy of respect. But a courageous willingness to face
opprobrium, an urgent need to speak the truth, a kind of necessity to
fight against all falsehood & hypocrisy, are no less important elements
of true religion. Some men will excel in some of these elements, some in
others. “A diversity of gifts, but the same spirit.”5 I do not doubt in
my own mind that many Ritualists6 who are or who fancy themselves ready
to go to the stake for the cause of smart dresses in Church; Dissenters
who will go to prison rather than pay Church rates; C[hurch] of
E[ngland] missionaries who distribute Bibles among the Chinese, are the
true brothers in spirit of Mr Bradlaugh. Like him they rush to excess in
following out their opinions, but like him they act upon the principle
that there are other things in this world better worth exertion than
this world’s goods. I myself know Edition: current; Page: [1501] very
little of Mr B. but I do happen to know that he has taken up several
points of opinion which it is to be supposed are obnoxious to the
working classes, although it is from the working classes alone that he
can look for support & influence. I know that he offends the upper
classes by his democracy, the middle classes by his atheism, & the
working classes by Malthusianism, not to speak of the representation of
minorities & of women—not very popular ideas either of them. How far Mr
B. supports any of these opinions in the same manner or on the same
grounds that I shd do myself I have not watched his career sufficiently
closely to know. I do know that he supports some of them very
differently from the way I think right. But I do not see how one can
escape from the conviction that he is a brave man: & nobody can have
heard him speak without believing him to be a clever one; so that he
could probably push his way by more commonplace means if he chose to
give up his opinions. I cannot say that I volunteered to support him as
I did Odger (the only man I have volunteered to support) but when I was
asked to do so, it seemed to me that it would have been fundamentally
irreligious, because fundamentally cowardly & self-interested, to shrink
back. We want now to establish a bond of union—public spirit & practical
good deeds—between all disinterested men. They ought all to stand by one
another, whatever their opinions, on this ground, & on this ground
alone. Again & again, since this doctrine was taught in the parable of
the Good Samaritan & in the Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans, the
battle has had to be fought for it; it is not half so bitter a struggle
now as it was in former times, but there is a good deal of bitterness
left, most of which bitterness however is imported into it by the
hypocrites, who use it as a weapon for their own purposes.

My dear Grote

I am extremely obliged to you for your kindness about the note on
Aristotle’s theory of Universals,2 to which I look forward with great
pleasure,3 and which will be a contribution to the value of the book
such as no one but yourself could give. I am very grateful also for the
kind things you say about my defeat in Westminster. Except as a part of
the general rout Edition: current; Page: [1502] of men of brains or of
strong opinions at these elections, I doubt if my rejection is to be
regretted even on public grounds, and on private it is most heartily to
be rejoiced at. I do not gather from my friends in Westminster any very
clear accounts of the cause of my defeat, but I put it down myself
mainly to three causes: the inferiority of the organisation directed by
a Committee to that which is pushed by one individual; the immense
influence of money; and the dislike of the Vestries to the Metropolitan
Bill.4 With such good causes as these, every little helps to swell the
general result, and with Disraeli for a leader the Tories are better
fitted to take advantage of every possible chance than they have been
for a long time. Of course, if my own rashness cost the seat, I should
not the less have done what I have done, for after all Gladstone can
better afford to lose one vote than I and those who care for me can
afford that I should not act up to my principles. But, as a matter of
fact, I greatly doubt whether Bradlaugh, Bouverie, &c. are at all
accountable for my defeat.

Helen thanks you very much for your kind mention of her in your letter.
But she feels the relief if possible with even more pleasure than I do.
Her health suffers very much from the English climate, and she is very
deeply imbued with the conviction that one true principle set afloat in
the world does more for progress than a hundred points of practical
detail. I am not sure whether she did not dislike my being in Parliament
more than I did myself, as she certainly suffered more from it in
health: but she would not give in, and made it a point of pride to
encourage me to stay at the post as long as there seemed any chance of
my doing anything at it. On the whole, we both feel that circumstances
have decided well for us. We think I was able to do some good work while
I was in the House, and we look forward with delight to being able now
to work in a much pleasanter manner. I shall soon have the Analysis
ready for the press and have other projects in view.

improve, I am

TO S. ALFRED STEINTHAL1

Avignon

,
1st December 1868

.

Dear Mr Steinthal,—

The result of the new elections, now that they are complete, appears to
be on the whole unfavourable to the cause of women’s suffrage. The new
members in favour of it are but few, and there have been losses among
both its Tory and Liberal supporters. It appears therefore improbable
that any efficient stand can be made on this subject in the House of
Commons this session; and I have long been of opinion, and expressed
myself strongly to that effect last year, that it would be injurious to
the cause if a division should take place leaving us with smaller
numbers than in the former division. It would be doubly injurious, first
by seeming to show a reaction in public opinion against us, and
secondly, by depriving us, as it very probably would, of the prestige of
Mr John Bright’s name,2 which at present we are able to boast.

Shortly before the late elections I received (and I suppose other
expected Members of Parliament received also) a circular which I
enclose, which was addressed to me in a blank cover. The announcement it
contained seemed singularly injudicious at a moment when it was quite
unknown what would be the character of the new House, and the question
ill timed, being addressed to men who might not be, and some of whom
have not proved to be, in it. I cannot help thinking that you will agree
with me that the most judicious way of bringing the subject before the
House of Commons is by petition, and if possible, by a petition on a far
greater scale than has been yet attempted. A really extensively signed
petition on the part of the women of the kingdom, with those men who
desire with them an alteration of the law in their favour, is the proper
reply to the authoritative decision that the law is now against them.
Indeed, if it were a good occasion for bringing forward a Bill in the
House of Commons, and if all promised favourably for an influential
increase of the votes on our side, it would still be most desirable to
show that out of the House as well as in it, and among women as well as
men, there exists a strong desire for their representation. And while
the feeling is still fresh among those women who have been disappointed
of the power to vote, is the time for asking them to petition. It would
show but little perseverance in Edition: current; Page: [1504] women if
they cannot go on year after year asking for this change of the law,
when we remember with what patience these sorts of petitions are
continually renewed for the various political objects which men desire.
If we compare the amount of petitioning that women have yet had patience
for, with the numbers sent up year after year on the comparatively small
grievance of Church rates, it would almost seem to justify the
assertions of those who say that women are not yet fit for political
rights if they are already wearied out. The desire to produce éclat and
great results with small means, and effects that should tell at once
rather than that should prepare the way silently for the future, are
indeed what we have to fear from inexperienced politicians. It seems
very advisable to show women that they have a means in their own hands
of quietly and steadily pressing their claims upon the legislature, and
encourage them to begin that great lesson of steady, silent, persevering
effort by which every class and nation has to be fitted for freedom.

publication as one which I should be very glad to aid, and that I may be
able to send an occasional contribution, but that, even when out of
Parliament, I have so little time for periodical writing, that I cannot
hold out any definite expectation. Dr Youmans expressed a desire to make
arrangements for the publication in America, simultaneously with
England, of any future books I may publish,3 and in this respect it is
probable that I may be able to meet his wishes.

I have been wanting to write to you ever since I read carefully through
the new edition of your First Principles4 and the whole of your
Biology,5 which formed a very interesting part of my occupations during
the last recess. But I had to get to other work, and meanwhile many
things which I had it in my mind to say to you have escaped my memory.
If worth saying they will again occur to me when I refer to your books,
which are not of a kind to make one rest contented with a single
reading. This I may say, that I have seldom been more strongly impressed
by any scientific treatise than by your Biology; that it has greatly
enhanced my sense of the importance of your philosophical enterprise as
a whole; and that, altogether apart from the consideration of what
portion of your conclusions, or indeed of your scientific premises, have
yet been brought into the domain of proved truth, the time had exactly
come when one of the greatest services that could be rendered to
knowledge was to start from those premises, simply as a matter of
hypothesis, and see how far they will go to form a possible explanation
of the concrete parts of organization and life. That they should go so
far as they do, fills me with wonder; and I do not doubt that your book,
like Darwin’s, will form an era in thought in its particular subject,
whatever be the scientific verdict ultimately pronounced on its
conclusions; of which my knowledge of the subject matter does not
qualify me to judge.

I look forward with great delight to occupations for myself, more allied
to yours than those to which so much of my time has been devoted for the
last three years; and I share your doubt whether the quieter mode of
usefulness which is so much more agreeable to myself, is not also, in my
case, the most Edition: current; Page: [1506] efficacious. I am on the
point of sending to press a new edition of my father’s Analysis of the
Mind,6 with copious notes and additions by Bain and myself, which,
bringing up the doctrines of the book to the present level, will give
one more classical work to the Experience Psychology. I am

TO JOHN ELLIOT CAIRNES1

Dear Mr Cairnes

I had the great pleasure of receiving your letter of Nov. 9 while I was
in England for the elections, and I afterwards saw a letter from you to
Thornton written on the news of my defeat. From this last I learnt that
your health was somewhat better since your return to Nice. It is very
pleasant that the climate of Nice seems to suit you, and to be at least
not unfavourable to Mrs Cairnes, of whose improvement in health you
report so satisfactorily.

I am very grateful for the kind interest you shew in my health and
feelings, but for neither need you feel the smallest anxiety. It must be
remembered that I am not alone to do my work, and that it is the work
not of one but of two persons. The cold I had when on the hustings soon
abated, and is now, I may say, gone; leaving me in every respect in my
usual health. And I really have much difficulty in feeling as I ought to
do about what is a real defeat to advanced Liberal opinions, so great
and fresh is the pleasure of the feeling of freedom, and the return to
the only occupations which agree with my tastes and habits. I hope to be
quite as active for my opinions out of the House as I was in it, and
more usefully so than I probably should have been during the next
Session (if not Sessions) during which the Irish Church will engross
nearly all the activity of Parliamentary men. You are the only person
who seems to me to feel about the Irish Church exactly as we do.2

There is discouragement in the general rejection by the constituencies,
of candidates whose claims were either those of culture or of democracy.
But when one looks into the circumstances, the case is not so bad as it
seems. Edition: current; Page: [1507] Things had so fallen out, through
management or neglect of management, that almost all the new University
Liberals, and almost all the working class candidates were sent to the
forlorn hopes. How could a Liberal expect to carry Woodstock, or
Chippenham, or even Abingdon? and how could a working man come in for
Warwick, or the hundreds of Aylesbury? When one adds to this that the
new electors were not likely to get into organised concert until they
were sure that they were on the register, which numbers of them were not
till the very eve of the dissolution, there is nothing in this part of
the results so ominous of the future as it at first appears. On the
other hand, the unanimity of Scotland, and the great Liberal gains in
Ulster, are of excellent augury, as shewing that a large portion of the
Presbyterians, even in the North of Ireland, are going in for
disestablishment. The lukewarmness on the subject which you observed in
the Catholic priests,3 makes the greatness of the gains in the Irish
elections more remarkable, since it must be ascribed mainly to the
laity.

I quite agree with you that the best chance of resisting the retrograde
step of making Irish education denominational, lies in delay.4 If two or
three years can be gained, we may hope that England will have entered so
decidedly into undenominationalizing education, that it will be
difficult to make a change in Ireland the reverse way. This is the one
question on which it seems to me that I might perhaps have been of some
use in this Parliament; because mischief may be done, which might be at
least mitigated by any one person’s raising his voice against it, or
even sometimes by mere lobby work among the members. However, we must
look to Lowe.

I regret very much the rejection of Chadwick who seemed latterly to have
a good chance of success, and who would have been a more valuable
acquisition to the House than any one man I can think of. Bradlaugh is,
as you say, not a working man: but if he had been repudiated generally
by the artisan class, he could hardly have obtained upwards of 1000
votes. I feel an interest Edition: current; Page: [1508] in him not
merely because of the religious cry raised against him, but because he
is as willing to stand up for opinions disliked by the working classes,
as for those by which he might hope to recommend himself to them:
witness his earnest Malthusianism, his support of women’s suffrage, and
his intelligent and thorough advocacy of Hare’s system.

I shall be very glad to see any further remarks of Mr McDonnell on the
subject of [his] essay.5 The difficulty of establishing a d[emocratic?]6
government in the Southern States is, no doubt, considerable, the white
population being what it is. But every month’s experience makes me feel
more and more, what an evil it would have been to have left a nucleus of
legal and recognised slavery even in the smallest corner of the Union.

Helen is in at least her usual health, and is likely to get much better
now, for the relief to her from our return to more healthy circumstances
is such as any one would hardly believe possible. She bore up most
heroically and wished me to remain in harness while it seemed a duty to
do so, but it was at the cost of gradually drying up her springs of
life.

With our kind regards to Mrs Cairnes, I am

TO MRS. PHILIPPINE KYLLMANN1

Avignon

Decr 4. 1868

My dear Mrs Kyllmann

I have just received yours of the 2nd which must have crossed my answer
to your former letter and from which I learn with regret that my delay
in answering was mistakenly attributed by you to reluctance to enter on
the subject. My delay was caused by my wish to shew your letter to Mr
Mill before I answered it, by his absence in England at the time I
received it & by the press of other business causing one or two days
delay after his return.

Edition: current; Page: [1509]
I am sure no one could think your letter other than most delicate, & the
request in it most reasonable. Had we known at the time I answered it
that you felt as strongly as from your last letter we see you do, in
which feeling we most fully sympathize, I shd not have hesitated myself
to enter more fully into the subject.

The letter I mentioned to you in my last was very far from the first of
the same sort I have received, & if I may judge by the apparently
studied discourtesy which has been shewn to us, of the habitual manner
in which friends & subscribers are treated by the Manchester branch of
the National Society, I believe that exceedingly few persons but
ourselves would have continued in spite of it to be as liberal as we
have been. That such habits must have the effect of alienating friends
from the cause I have long felt with regret. I was not aware, of course,
until I heard from you, that the urgent requests for money by which the
M. Committee has been distinguished from all the other branches of the
Society, were not authorized by the Committee meetings. However much
offended & pained we have felt by many things we did not choose to
withdraw altogether our pecuniary support when we supposed it was
urgently needed: but we did, by insisting that the larger part of it shd
be given entirely in your name, endeavour to secure its application to
the purposes we desired.

We were greatly pleased to find that you are again Treasurer, as we had
hoped to be able to communicate with you occasionally on these matters
in future, & our last subscn to the M. Comee would have been
considerably smaller in amount had we not wished to secure you against
loss. We never for a moment supposed that you were cognizant of any of
the letters we received unless when they had been directed to be written
by the Comee. How far this last was the case we were of course unable to
judge, but we supposed that although the particular terms were not
dictated by the Cee, the request was made by its directions. We
certainly thought that as our subscns had been made for two trials &
only one came on, there would have been more delicacy shewn if some part
had been returned, or some statement of the expenses incurred had been
forwarded to us. Our experience however did not lead us to expect
anything of the sort.

It is with very great sorrow I find that my unfortunate delay shd have
caused you to think that we in any degree attributed any of all this to
you. We have often deeply regretted the loss of our friend2 & his
invaluable services in this as in every other good cause & that it
should have brought with it what seemed the very natural consequence
that your own health shd keep you out of the active part of the Cee. I
am sure you will understand that we cannot for a moment think of
accepting your generous inclosure. We have felt from the first moment of
seeing your name in the newspapers that in giving your name Edition:
current; Page: [1510] & being willing to take the responsibility of
expense if need be you have done fully your part. I therefore beg of you
to allow us to share with you as we wished to do in the enterprise, & if
your share of the expenses of the appeal have amounted to £50, we shd
wish to pay it all. Moreover I do not understand what complications may
have arisen with the M. Cee and we are most anxious that you shd not be
involved in any misunderstandings in the matter. If the funds we
subscribed for the expenses of your appeal have been applied to any
other purpose, we will not consent to your making it good to us. If we
consented to this, our purpose would be doubly thwarted. Money would
have been applied to objects for which we had no intention of advancing
it & the final result of the whole transaction would be that you are a
loser.

There is so much that is unsatisfactory for some time past about the
management of the M Cee that we feel we had better not be concerned in
it for the present.3 For while we feel that we have ourselves been the
objects of marked rudeness, we feel that as long as our names are
connected with it we might be held responsible in some measure for
rudeness of the same sort towards other people. But as it appears to us
most desirable for the interests of the cause that there should be no
dissensions among its supporters, we have not chosen to express our
feelings to the Cee as a body, even shd we wish to withdraw our help
when it is engaged in doing useful work which we alone are willing to
help effectually. For this reason it is that we have gone on subscribing
& have asked no questions about the application of our last
subscriptions.

But if you judge that by the Committee or any of its members being aware
of our feelings any good purpose could be served we are quite willing
that anything I have said shd be made use of for the purpose.

A thousand thanks for your kind & warm hearted letter. It is not

assurance that friends like you think after trial that my presence was
really useful in the H. of Commons is an evidence I could ill spare that
I did not commit an error of judgment when I exchanged another mode of
usefulness for the far less congenial one of a seat in Parlt. In
returning to my older & more natural mode of activity I shall not lose
the feeling which my three years in Parlt have given me, of brotherhood
in arms with those who are still there fighting the battles of advanced
liberalism, & I shall always be happy & proud to cooperate with them out

You will, I am sure, understand that my not having acknowledged your
letter of Nov. 20 until I have nearly brought up the arrears of my
correspondence, was not because I felt little, but because you do not
need any fresh assurances to know how much I do feel. I am not the less
touched at the regrets of my friends because I myself have no need of
consolation. On the contrary, we are in the first flush of enjoyment of
our recovered freedom, and in better cue than we have been a long while
for working hard and efficiently for our opinions. The elections, though
so unfavourable to candidates of advanced opinions, have given us a
House capable of the immediate work it had to do, viz. to make Gladstone
minister, and disestablish the Irish Church. Between this and the next
General Election, the working classes will have time to organize their
political action, and to insist upon having an equal share of influence
in the choice of candidates: and it is then, and not before, that
Chadwicks will prevail over Bouveries and Odgers over Henry Hoares.2
Edition: current; Page: [1512] Meanwhile it is a great satisfaction to
me that you are still in the House to assert great principles, and that
you are as unlikely a man as any one there to be easily discouraged. I

The “Analysis of the Mind” has long been out of print, but a new edition

Company. The publisher of the edition, Mr Madden,5 has, I am almost
sure, given up business, but I do not know into whose hands his

I thank you sincerely for your kind condolences on my defeat at

Dear Sir—

The earnest & kindly letter which I have just received from the
Committee of the Chelsea Working Men’s Parliamentary Electoral
Association gives me very great pleasure. That the élite of the working
classes should think so kindly of me & should attach so much importance
to my political services, I feel to be a subject of just pride, since it
has been given to me not in spite of, but, as I believe partly in
consequence of, my having made no sacrifices of my honest convictions to
obtain it. It is because I have never concealed from the working
classes, any more than from any other class, my differences of opinion
with them, & my determination not to be the organ in parliament of any
opinions not my own, that they have had confidence in my sincerity when
I professed to agree with them, & have never failed to give me a
patient, a respectful, & even a sympathetic hearing on the points on
which we differed.

If the electors of the working classes continue to guide themselves in
the choice & treatment of their representatives by the same principles &
feelings which have governed their conduct towards me, the progress of
democracy will soon cease to give uneasiness to any sincere & reasonable
minds.

There is much which is gratifying & something which is disappointing in
the results of the General Election. It has decided, thoroughly &
irrevocably, the question of religious equality in Ireland, in the only
way which could be tolerated in the present age, the impartial
disendowment of all sects: & has to that extent lightened the burthen of
the reparation due to the people of that ill-treated country for
centuries of misrule. It has also raised to the place Edition: current;
Page: [1514] of highest power the one English minister2 of past or
present times who has best deserved, & has obtained in largest measure,
the confidence of the labouring classes. On the other hand, those
classes, though to their votes the liberal party principally owes its
victory, are far from having had their just influence in the selection
of the members who represent the party in the new H. of Commons. No
working man has been a successful candidate; even so distinguished a
member of the working class as Mr Odger, the ignorant attacks on whom
have only served to bring forth from all sides additional tributes to
his worth has found, even in your metropolitan borough, that the zeal of
his supporters could not compete with the greater wealth & superior
organization of other candidates & when this was ascertained, he
honourably consented to withdraw. Those new candidates who though not
working men, possessed the special confidence of the working classes, or
who combined high education & culture with advanced opinions, have in
general been equally unsuccessful.

It was not to be expected that there could be much organisation &
concert among voters who, when the election took place, had only just
been put on the electoral roll. But if these things happen a second
time, the new electors will have chiefly themselves to blame.

Public opinion will in time demand the only complete remedy, the
adoption of Personal Representation, by which the electors would be
enabled to group themselves as they pleased, & any electors who chose to
combine could be represented, in exact proportion to their numbers, by
men of their own personal choice. But as this great improvement in
representative Govt is not yet ripe for adoption, what should be done
now is that the working classes should assert their right to an equal
voice with the Liberals of the higher & middle classes in the choice of
Liberal candidates. Where a place returns two members, one of these
should be a candidate specially acceptable to the working classes: where
there is but one, he shd be selected in concert by both sections of
liberals. Thus much the working classes are fairly entitled to, & thus
much if they insist, they will obtain; for liberal candidates can in
most places no more be elected without their cooperation, than elected
by them alone, without the cooperation of others.

There is one thing more which demands the immediate & most strenuous
efforts of the working classes & of all who wish the recent change in
our representative institutions to be more than nominal. The real cause
of the failure of working class candidates & of so many other advanced
liberals in the late contests, is the inordinate expense of elections.
In a great majority of these cases, if money had had no influence, or if
the expenditure of it had been Edition: current; Page: [1515] equal on
both sides, the popular candidate would in all probability have
succeeded. If the working classes ever wish to be more genuinely
represented than they are, they should make a united & energetic appeal
to Parlt to clear away this obstacle to their representation. They
should demand that the necessary expenses of elections be made a public
charge, & that the useless & noxious expenses be made illegal &
punishable. Some of their best friends vainly exerted themselves to
extort measures for this purpose from the last Parliament, but Tories &
lukewarm Liberals were too strong for them. Mr. Gladstone however made
known both by speech & vote his approbation of the attempt; & we may
feel confident that if properly supported by the people he will be no
reluctant leader in the accomplishment of this, one of the most urgent
as well as essential of remaining Parliamentary reforms. But when there
is so great a mass of interested or timid resistance to be encountered,
a reform is not properly supported unless it is strenuously urged.

Once more thanking your Committee for their gratifying expression of
feeling towards me, I am, &c

Dear Sir

I am much honoured by your thinking it worth while to write so long and
interesting a letter for the purpose of convincing me that the people of
Victoria are not so far gone in Protectionism as they are thought to be.
I have never laid stress on anything contained in the article in the
Westr Review,2 which did not, to my judgment, look like a fair
representation. I need not say how glad I should be to believe that the
Victoria Protectionists are Protectionists only within the limits of my
excepted case, i.e. that they only wish for temporary protection to try
the experiment of naturalizing foreign branches of industry.
Unfortunately, the writings I have seen on their side of the question
Edition: current; Page: [1516] (I admit that they are not numerous) make
no reservation of the kind, but advocate the general theory of
Protection, on the old ignorant grounds, support it by the old stock
fallacies, and refer to the stupidest authorities, British, American,
and Continental, as a sanction for it. All this is very natural. The
Protectionist theory appears plain common sense to persons thoroughly
ignorant of the subject; and industries artificially fostered, even
though it be professedly for a time only, raise up private interests
which combine, as they have done in the United States but too
effectually, to convert what was intended as a temporary expedient into
a permanent institution; (though the thick end of the wedge seldom
follows the thin end at so short an interval as three years). These
considerations have greatly shaken the opinion I expressed in my book;
and though I still think that the introduction of a foreign industry is
often worth a sacrifice, and that a temporary protecting duty if it was
sure to remain temporary, would probably be the best shape in which that
sacrifice can be made, I am inclined to believe that it is safer to make
it by an annual grant from the public treasury, which is not nearly so
likely to be continued indefinitely to prop up an industry which has not
so thriven as to be able to dispense with it.

I can readily believe that the Free Trade party in Victoria is swelled
by the private self interest of importing merchants; but a cause seldom
triumphs unless somebody’s personal interest is bound up with it. It
would have been long before the corn laws would have been abolished in
Great Britain if, besides the public interests concerned, those laws had
not been contrary to the private interests of nearly the whole of the
manufacturing and mercantile classes.

It gives me extreme pleasure that you approve of what I have said and
done to promote the admission of women to the political franchise. If
your important and rising community could be induced to adopt this great
social improvement (if I am rightly informed, it is adopted already at
your municipal elections) it would not be the first time that a colony
has outstripped the mother country in the introduction of improved
principles of legislation.

Though your poetry2 had been equal to Shelley’s, it probably would not

Even he, however, gives you credit for “some poetic ability.” But I am

is thrown away when it addresses itself to the world by means of verse.

Since I wrote to you I have received a more definite letter from Mr

with stereotype plates, but I think they ought to pay something more
than the mere cost of casting. It would be fair that they should also
pay a proportion of the cost of setting the type. About 15 per cent on
this cost would probably be sufficient. It is to be remembered that the
cost of setting the types of a book intended to be stereotyped is
greater than when this is not the case.”

It is for you to consider whether you regard Mr Longman’s proposal as
acceptable.

Dec. 11. 1868

Dear Sir—

Pray excuse my long delay in answering your letter.2 I have no doubt
that as you say our defeat in W[estminster] is owing to the good
organisation & discipline of the Tories, to their lavish expenditure,
much of which according to your account must have come within the legal
penalties of treating, & to their having on their side a large number of
practised electioneers, & perhaps some of them vestrymen, offended by
the municipal bills. It is of great importance that W[estminster] shd
redeem itself, & I heartily wish you Edition: current; Page: [1519]
success in your endeavours. At the same time, if we take a large view of
the subject, it appears to me that it is more conducive to the growth of
high political principle in the electors & consequently to the permanent
political progress of the nation, that the liberal party in any
constituency shd occasionally suffer defeat from the scrupulous purity
of the means it employs, than that it shd practise tactics unworthy of a
good cause & thereby win a seeming success by means subversive of the
principles to which the party owes its life. It is very painful to all
true liberals to see their own constituency represented by a Tory in
Parlt. Yet I think that this sometimes may be a wholesome humiliation if
it stimulates them to redoubled efforts to arouse the political energies
of the constituency by all morally legitimate & honorable means. The
true humiliation is when honorable men become in the words of the Psalm,
“emulous of evil doers,”3 & despairing of serving a good cause by good
means, fancy that a temporary discomfiture is a permanent defeat & have
recourse to methods of achieving success which are quite as humiliating
as, & infinitely more mischievous than, defeat itself. It is much to be
hoped that the advanced liberal party which has to a certain extent,
owing partly to its want of organisation & partly to the results of its
scrupulous adherence to perfectly honourable means, sustained a
comparative defeat all over the country, will not despair of future
success by such means, but will remember that so great & so important a
reform as purity of election cannot be won at once nor until after
having sustained many partial reverses.

I must take this opportunity of thanking you & the other kind friends
who supported me in W. for their zealous support & for the thorough
manner in which they carried out the principles on which I stood: & I
can assure you that although I had not personally any desire to be in
the H. of C. I did not on that account neglect anything that I thought
it right for me to do or not to do for the purpose of securing my
election. I can sincerely say (& it is due to the electors of W. that it
shd have been so) that I acted in all things as I shd have done had my
career been dependent upon my success. Whatever I did that might seem to
have perilled my return, I did not do because I was indifferent to my
return, for as an honorable politician I could never be indifferent to
the return of any liberal candidate, & as candidate for W. I was doubly
bound in honor to exert myself for the liberal representation of the
constituency: which motive I am sure you will do me the justice to
believe, was fully as strong in my mind as the desire to be in Parlt
could be in the mind of any ambitious young politician. If, therefore, I
felt myself obliged to do some things which it is very likely. . . .4

Dear Sir—

When I had the honour of receiving your letter of Sept. 4 my time was so
fully occupied with our great electoral struggle & other things, that I
have been obliged to defer answering it till now.

I have had a rather extensive correspondence with various persons in
Australia respecting the sanction supposed to be given by the passage
which you quote from my Pol. Econ. to the Protectionist doctrines there
afloat. One of my most recent explanatory letters which was addressed to
Mr Holden,2 Member of the Legislative Council of N. S. Wales, has been
printed in the newspapers of that Colony, & it is not unlikely that
since writing your letter you may have seen it.3

The Protecting Duties which I thought might sometimes be advisable in a
young country for the purpose of ascertaining by experiment the
suitability of its circumstances for the naturalisation of foreign
branches of industry, are duties expressly imposed for a limited time,
not exceeding a few years (say from five to twelve or thereabouts
according to the case) & to cease peremptorily at the end of the period
unless it could be conclusively shewn that the facilities given by the
duties had been fairly used, but required some further & still more
strictly limited time to make the experiment a fair one.

Some Australians have assured me that the Australian Protectionists do
not carry their Protectionist proclivities beyond this point. I observe
however that the protectionist interests which are fostered by the
protecting duties, are raising up as they have always done elsewhere,
protectionist theories of the old type & that the most exploded
fallacies of the mercantile system are revived, with a simple ignorance
of all that has been written & proved against them, which is strange to
minds accustomed to the subject as usually discussed in Europe.

There is great danger that the duties even if imposed ostensibly for a
time only, would at the expiration of the time, or before it, have been
made permanent: that they were not, I believe, in any case, imposed as
temporary duties but were as permanent as any Acts of the Colonial
Parliaments.

I am now much shaken in the opinion, which has so often been quoted for
purposes which it did not warrant; & I am disposed to think that when it
is advisable, as it may sometimes be, to subsidize a new industry in its
commencement, Edition: current; Page: [1521] this had better be done by
a direct annual grant, which is far less likely to be continued after
the conditions which alone justified it have ceased to exist.

Dear Madam—

Few things could be more gratifying to me than the letter with which I
have been honoured by you and your Committee, & I beg you to accept & to
convey to the Cee my warmest acknowledgments.

Of all my recollections connected with the H of C that of my having had
the honour of being the first to make the claim of women to the suffrage
a parliamentary question,2 is the most gratifying as I believe it to
have been the most important public service that circumstances made it
in my power to render. This is now a thing accomplished & the cause has
a sufficient number of supporters among the best men in the H of C. to
carry on as much of the contest as can be conducted there. It remains
for the intelligent women of the country to give their moral support to
the men who are engaged in urging their claims, & to open the minds of
the less intelligent to the fact that political freedom is the only
effectual remedy for the evils from which most women are conscious that
women suffer. Whatever power I may have to promote this cause outside
the H of C I shall not fail to exert to my utmost.

Your expressions of sympathy with my feelings & approbation of my
conduct on the subject of the Jamaica atrocities3 are peculiarly
grateful to me, for it has been with especial sorrow that I have seen so
many women cold & unmoved at the recital of sufferings which it might
have been supposed would at least have aroused some womanly pity, &
generous indignation against the perpetrators. It is peculiarly among
women who are not aware that it is their duty to use their intelligence
on matters of politics, that the severest condemnation of Mr Eyre & his
instruments shd have been found, for if such Edition: current; Page:
[1522] women had possessed the warmth of heart which all women ought to
have, their feelings would have been revolted at the tortures inflicted,
& they would have considered the reasonings by which they were attempted
to be palliated as beyond their province. As it is, the conduct of so
many among them has afforded one more evidence that the renunciation of
masculine intelligence gives no security for womanly kindness.

Dear Sir—

I beg to say that in the first place to wish for a man’s success as a
parly candidate is not to identify oneself with him: if it were, how
could a Catholic vote for a Protestant, a Churchman for a Dissenter, or
a Xtian for a Jew? In the second place I did not go out of my way to
subscribe to Mr Bradlaugh’s expenses (expenses for which had my own & Mr
Fawcett’s amendments to the Bribery Bill2 been carried last session no
subscription would have been needed) but I did not consider myself
justified in refusing when asked to lighten the iniquitous expenses
which would have prevented an otherwise eligible man from even taking
the sense of the electors of Northampton concerning him, merely because
either I or other people did not approve of his being, as I have been
told he has been, as insolent towards Xtians in general as excellent
Xtians have often been towards one another. If you think that the man
who will vote for the perpetuation of the oppression of one sect of
Xtians by another, as Mr Smith will do,3 represents you better than I
could have done, you did your duty. If not, you must excuse my saying
that you appear to me to have allowed an unreflecting displeasure at an
unpractical evil to overcome your sense of what as an elector you owe
not only to your own country but to a nation which your countrymen have
long oppressed.

If Mr B is only generally known for blasphemy, it must be because the
facts concerning him are not generally known. I who do not know that he
has stood forward as the advocate of many other opinions, the advocating
of Edition: current; Page: [1523] which must be contrary to his
interests, was bound to act upon my better knowledge, and if a
long-established character is worth anything, those who have done me the
honour to approve of my general line of conduct & my published writings
for 30 years & more, might fairly be expected to suppose that I was not
likely to support any man for no other reason than that he had made
himself remarkable by blasphemy.

The fact that you approved my conduct in the proceedings against Mr Eyre
makes me hope that, on further reflection you will see that I was not so
much to blame as you imagine about Mr B.

Dec. 14. 1868

Dear Sir

I have not gone deeply into the subject of the treatment of prisoners,
tickets of leave, &c. but from all that I have seen & heard upon it I am
under the impression that I shd place great reliance upon the opinion of
Sir Walter Crofton.2

There are, however, some points respecting criminals & the police, on
which I have formed a decided opinion of my own, which in each case,
were it necessary, I think I could support by a very wide induction. I
will not go at length into any of these, but I will just note them down.

1. I observed with satisfaction that one point was judiciously insisted
on by Mr Edwin Hill3 at the meeting at which you attended. It is that
there shd be a great increase of efforts to root out the receivers of
stolen goods. The receivers are the solid support & foundation of all
professional theft, & without them a criminal class, as a class, could
not exist. If there were no receivers Edition: current; Page: [1524]
there could be no professional or habitual thieves; but only casual acts
of theft from necessity or temptation, with which it is comparatively
easy to deal. Receivers being persons of some pecuniary means, &
permanent habitation, it is possible to make them accountable. I am not
in a condition to say what means shd be adopted for making receivers of
stolen goods more amenable to justice: it requires some one more
familiar than I am with the criminal law & with the practice of the
criminal courts to say at what point the failure now takes place, but I
am satisfied that this is a direction in which the law requires either
to be strengthened or to be more vigorously enforced.

2. A great effect in checking crime would be produced by simply
abrogating the rule of our criminal procedure which forbids putting
questions to the prisoner. I doubt if public opinion is yet prepared for
abolishing this rule: yet it might be done without any danger of
introducing the evils of the French criminal procedure, which mainly
arise from making the judge instead of the counsel the interrogator of
the prisoner & witnesses.

3. I am clearly of opinion that the attempt to place criminals who have
worked out their sentences under the permanent surveillance of the
police, is wrong in principle, & would not work well in practice,
necessarily carrying along with it a number of abuses which it would be
impossible efficiently to control, besides involving the decision of
some other large questions for the decision of which the time is not yet
ripe. The difficulty of dealing with those who pick up a livelihood by
odd jobs; & with those whose employers know their antecedents but whose
fellow workmen do not; would be in its own nature very great, while it
would give great scope either for connivance or for oppression by the
police. It would be necessary to decide what are lawful means of
livelihood & the law would either have to recognise prostitution as a
legitimate profession, or to put it down by force. I believe many of
those who wish for the permanent surveillance of criminals are desirous
also of establishing prostitution on a legitimate basis. I think them
completely wrong in principle, & mistaken as to the practical benefits
which seem to arise from such a plan; but whether or no, the one change
cannot be made without the other, & I believe that a more efficient
police force, greater rigour against receivers, greater certainty of
conviction & greater steadiness & uniformity in the treatment of
convicts, would be much more efficient in reducing crime than any
surveillance that it is humanly possible to practise over criminals.

4. The first, the most obvious, & the most important condition of an
efficient police is an exceedingly simple one, which while it recommends
itself at first sight to every impartial person, has been of late years
totally neglected among ourselves, although the insisting upon it alone,
without any other reform, would I believe do more to improve the
character of the force than all the other measures put together.

This condition is, that no person in the police force be permitted to
receive Edition: current; Page: [1525] money or gifts of any sort
whatever from any private individual. This rule shd be absolute &
inflexibly applied. No services of any sort, whether within or without
the routine of regular duty, shd be permitted to receive any reward,
either honorary or pecuniary, openly or privately, from individuals or
from public bodies, except from the superior authorities of the force
itself, & then in the way only of avowed promotion & increase of pay.
Also the mere acceptance of food or drink or shelter while on duty from
any person whatever shd be ipso facto sufficient to ensure expulsion
from the force.

It is obvious that employing policemen for private purposes must draw
off their time, their attention & their interest, from their public
duty. It is a mere sophism to say for instance that if you give a man
whose duty it is to watch over the safety of a whole street a few pounds
a year to watch more peculiarly over the safety of a few houses in it,
it only quickens his zeal for them without diminishing his zeal for the
rest. The work for which he receives no extra pay is certain to be
considered of minor importance, & to be neglected in favour of that for
which he expects special remuneration.

The insidious working of the system of perquisites is even more
mischievous than its direct & obvious effects. It may be laid down as a
rule of pol. economy that what people get by way of gifts connected with
their profession or mode of earning their living, comes in the end to be
counted as part of their earnings. Hence, however little they themselves
may desire such a result, perquisites invariably have the effect of
lowering men’s legitimate & regular pay. This has been found both in
higher & lower examples than that of the police force. The working of
this rule is well known to all political economists with regard to the
agricultural labourers under the old poor law system; it is well known
to all reforming politicians with regard to the perquisites of public
servants of the highest ranks. I believe it to have acted injuriously
upon the moral character of the police force. The fall in the value of
money which should be met by increase of pay, is apt to be, I believe
has actually been, chiefly met by the increased urgency & ingenuity of
the men in eking out their pay by perquisites. This is a natural
tendency which can only be combated by liberality in pay on the part of
the employers, accompanied by inflexible severity in putting down the
perquisite system. This combined liberality & severity is essential
precisely in proportion to the responsibility of any employment, and the
importance of honesty in it. When the perquisite system is allowed to
prevail the best men get the fewest gifts: for they neither are so
impudent in putting themselves in the way of gifts, nor so willing to
neglect their proper duty for the sake of them. Hence the best men get
the worst pay, are disgusted with the force, gladly take other places
when they can get them, & leave only the worst men behind. The same
reasons apply of course to the enlistment of new men: & step by step the
men get worse & worse, carry on the system of favour more openly &
impudently year by year, until the disgraceful Edition: current; Page:
[1526] state of things of the Haymarket is arrived at,4 while the
increasing difficulty of the superiors in finding trustworthy men to
replace the untrustworthy causes them to go on tolerating abuses, the
toleration of which in its turn makes the men more encroaching, &
creates a vicious circle which nothing but a complete change of system
can break through.

I am glad to hear the Tory is not to sit for Westr without at least an
attempt to protest against it,5 & I hope the attempt will result in
opening the way for a liberal. I can say this the more freely as I am no
longer a party concerned.

My dear Grote

I thank you most heartily for your very valuable contribution to the new
edition of the Analysis.2 It is not a particle too long. The strictures
it contains on the substantive doctrine of the chapters on
Classification and Abstraction, coincide generally with, though they are
not in the least superseded by, my own remarks on those chapters; and it
is not only very pleasant but a great advantage, to have views
substantially similar expressed in a decidedly different manner and
propounded under the sanction of your name.

The feeling you have in making dissentient criticisms on the Analysis, I
fully share. I have had to express difference of opinion on a number of
points, some of them important; and so great a part of my notes is taken
up with justifying the dissent that I have an uncomfortable feeling as
if I should appear too much in the character of an assailant. I have
endeavoured to obviate this by the Preface (or Introduction). I think I
ought to quote from it a passage in which I have mentioned your name,
which if it meets otherwise with your approbation, you will see may
conduce to the same purpose with regard to yourself:3

“Such was the effect of his conversation, and of the tone of his
character, on those who were within reach of its influence, that many,
then young, who Edition: current; Page: [1527] have since made
themselves honoured in the world by a valuable career, look back to
their intercourse with him as having had a considerable share in
deciding their course through life. The most distinguished of them all,
Mr Grote, has put on record, in a recent publication,4 his sense of
these obligations, in terms equally honourable to both.”

I have entered fully into the distinction between my father’s use of the
term cannote and my own, and into the reasons for preferring mine;5 but
there will be no need to cancel more than a few words (if any) of your
note in consequence.

I will give orders that a proof be sent to you.

I have always felt the same doubt which you express as to my comparative
power of usefulness in and out of the House of Commons. But it was worth
giving three years of life to bring the question of Women’s Suffrage to
the point it has now reached.

We are delighted to hear so good an account of Mrs Grote’s improved
health. Pray give her our kindest regards.

May I request your acceptance of the inclosed cheque, not however as any
return for your kindness in turning aside from your work to help in
this, for which I am very much indebted to you. I am

Mesdames:

I have learned with pleasure, mingled with admiration, that there are
found in Russia, women sufficiently enlightened and courageous to demand
for their sex a participation in the various branches of higher
historical, philological and scientific education, including the
practical art of medicine, Edition: current; Page: [1528] and to gain
for this cause important support from the scientific world. That is what
the most enlightened persons are asking, without having yet attained it,
in the other countries of Europe. Thanks to you, Mesdames, Russia is
perhaps about to surpass them in speed; it would be a proof that
civilization relatively recent, sometimes accepts before the older
civilizations great ideas of amelioration. The equal advent of both
sexes to intellectual culture is important not only to women, which is
assuredly a sufficient recommendation, but also to universal
civilization. I am profoundly convinced that the moral and intellectual
progress of the male sex runs a great risk of stopping, if not receding,
as long as that of the women remains behind, and that, not only because
nothing can replace the mother for the education of children, but also
because the influence upon man himself of the character and ideas of the
companions of his life cannot be insignificant; woman must either push
him forward or hold him back. I applaud with all my heart your efforts
and those of the enlightened men who support them, and I reckon upon the
perseverence of which you have already shewn proof, as a guarantee that
you will not become discouraged, and that you will assert by every means
the justice of your cause, which, in an enlightened age, bids fair to
meet in a short time an assured success.

Pray receive, Mesdames, the sincere expression of my high esteem and
lively sympathy.

Dear Sir—

Owing to the peculiar sensitiveness which both of us are aware of in Mr
Spencer, it is to be feared that he would be displeased at anything that
would look like an advertisement or a testimonial; & it would be well if
the purpose you have in view & which I greatly wish to promote, could be
attained by something written ostensibly for a different purpose. Your
suggestion of putting something quotable into the book I am now
editing,2 is of this nature, & there are already passages in it
respecting Mr Spencer that would serve for quotation; but they refer to
the Psychology, not to the First Principles or the Biology, & it would
be difficult to find a good occasion for Edition: current; Page: [1529]
referring to either of these in a book exclusively psychological. There
is in the 13th chapter of my Examination of Sir W. Hamilton’s Philosophy
the following sentence: “This last extract is from Mr Herbert Spencer
whose Principles of Psychology in spite of some doctrines which he holds
in common with the intuitive school, are on the whole one of the finest
examples we possess of the Psychological Method in its full power.” Mr
Spencer is mentioned with honour in several other parts of the same
work. If none of these passages will serve the purpose, or if you think
it desirable in addition to have something from me, in which the First
Principles & Biology are spoken of to the same effect as in my letter to
Mr Spencer, I think the best way would be for you, or some one else, to
write me a letter asking my opinion on those works, as if for private
satisfaction.

From the date of your letter I am afraid you must have left England
before receiving two letters which I wrote to you from Avignon on the
9th & 10th,3 respecting the conditions in which Messrs Longmans were
willing to consent to the proposal you made for taking moulds from the
type of the new edition of the “Analysis of the Human Mind.” If you have
returned to America there will not now be time to make any such
arrangement for the present book as it is now partly in the printer’s
hands & I wish to bring it out as soon as possible. But as the same
question may occur again, & as my letters may not have been forwarded to
you from the Langham hotel, I will quote Mr Longman’s words

“With regard &c4

Dear Sir,—

When I received your letter I was on the point of writing to you to say
that when I wrote to M. Esquiros2 I had not the remotest idea that my
letter would be published; for had I intended it for publication, as
perhaps you supposed I did from the manner in which it was inserted in
the Star, I should not have omitted to make honourable mention of your
name. Edition: current; Page: [1530] I was greatly surprised to see it,
and still more to see the manner in which it was inserted in the Star. I
do not know how my friend M. Esquiros came to consent to its
publication, for I am sure he would not have done so had he known my
feeling against the publication of private letters without the
permission of the writer. I certainly did infer from your published
letter that you thought me wrong,3 not in the things I did, but in doing
them without sufficient consideration for my constituents. I am
therefore very glad to hear from yourself that that was not your
feeling.

Although I think it is to be regretted that you thought it necessary to
give publicity to any difference of opinion between us, I might have
been tempted to reply publicly to your letter myself, but I think it
better to abstain than to give a handle for those who would be delighted
to see anything like apparent dissension.

If I have not written to you before now, thanking you for your exertions
in the election,4 it has been from the tendency to say least to those in
whom one feels the fullest confidence. I felt so sure of your public
spirit that I have thought you could not possibly doubt my esteem nor
care for any expressions of gratitude from me for services to the cause
in which we are fellow-workers.

I had occasion some little time ago to write to Mr Beggs5 in reply to a
letter from him, and in doing so I said what I would have been far more
willing to see published than anything else I have written on the
subject, inasmuch as I assured him that I had omitted nothing that
conscience and sense of public duty would allow me to do to secure my
return for Westminster. However little I personally wished to be
returned, I felt that I owed it to my constituents to do all that lay in
my power to succeed; but I did not feel that I owed it either to them or
to myself to go against the very principles upon which I was standing.
Those for whose sake I most cared to succeed, among the foremost of whom
was yourself, would not have had a true representative in me if I had
after all succumbed to that temptation to time-serving, the very
prevalence of which, and my protests against which, were their original
Edition: current; Page: [1531] reason for choosing me. It is better to
have a man who has never made any pretence of disliking it, than one
who, after having protested strongly against it, has finally fallen a
victim to the many temptations to practise it. In fine, I thought that
my constituents as well as myself would rather have Mr Smith as he is,
than myself false to my professions. It is, of course, a subject of
regret to all who feel as you and I do that absolute purity of principle
in electioneering, and perfect independence on the part of candidates,
cannot be made to succeed better than it generally does at present, yet
I think I have done more to draw attention to the need of it by my
failure than I could have done if I had allowed it to be possible to
reproach me with the smallest tergiversation. The slightest example of
anything of the kind would of course have been eagerly seized by our
opponents, and nothing that they can say now can be so mortifying to you
or myself as such accusations would have been had they had a shadow of
foundation. Could it have been said that I turned my back upon old
friends or shrunk from any associations that were not likely to be
popular with the mass of my constituents, neither society nor the press
would have failed to say it.

P.S.—As I have very unexpectedly seen so many of my letters lately in
print, may I beg you to consider my letters as not intended for the
public. Pray excuse my making this request to you, with whom I have
every reason to believe it unnecessary.

Dear Sir—

I am much honoured by the renewal of the invitation from the Philomathic
Socy,2 & could I be sure of any definite result, more particularly of
any definite political result, that could be obtained by my acceding to
it, I would not hesitate to come to England for the purpose & to
undertake the labour of preparing something for the occasion, although
to do so would require me to put aside avocations in which I am now
engaged & which I expect will fully occupy my time for some months to
come so that my present plan is not to be in England until the beginning
of March. But I am very distrustful Edition: current; Page: [1532] of
the good that can be effected or at all events of my own power to effect
much good, by merely social means, or even by eliciting sympathies
chiefly literary or scientific: Knowing as I do how many of the
slaveholders approved of & admired my writings, I know how little any
practical political results need necessarily follow from this sort of
approval: & although I am aware that the enthusiasm produced by oratory
is among many, perhaps among the majority of men, warmer than that felt
for any literary works, still I doubt whether it is more lasting & I am
quite sure that it is not within my own power to excite so much of it.
Could I within the compass of an after dinner speech carefully
calculated to touch upon no points which could hurt the feelings of any
who differ from us most radically both in principles & in their
applications, produce any appreciable effect in reuniting & stimulating
the liberal political opinions of Liverpool? Were you proposing to
discuss any especial political topics (for example such as the
representation of minorities) which I have made the object of study, the
case might be different, for it might then be in my power to advance
arguments & to put them in a point of view not usual. But from what you
say I imagine that you think politics shd be eschewed & even the
political aspect of such subjects as education avoided. Nor am I quite
sure whether just at present my views on personal representation, on the
applications of endowments, on the land laws, on trades unions, & other
topics partly politico-economical & partly political, might not be
somewhat too startling for those who shrink even from the disendowment
of the Irish Church.

I hope you will not be deterred by thinking it unnecessary. Even if it
is to the same effect as something written by Bain or me (Findlater’s
notes are mainly philological) it will be more or less from a different
point of view, and will not be a repetition, but valuable as a
confirmation.

I am glad you approve of the passage in the Preface.3 I think, when you
see the remainder, you will regard the historical and philosophical
place assigned in it to the Analysis as the right one. The new edition
will now be a monument collectively raised to the memory of the author
by the principal inheritors of his philosophy, while it will also
authenticate, and in part exhibit, the progress since made in the paths
which he opened up.

With our kind regards to Mrs Grote, I am

My dear Grote
 ever yours truly

TO GEORGE HOWELL1

A[vignon]

Dec. 27. 1868

Dear Sir—

I cannot leave unacknowledged the concluding sentence of your letter of
the 19th inst.2 If you had been returned for Aylesbury & had made the
public spirited offer of retiring in my favour I could not possibly have
accepted it. I attach far too much importance to the representation of
the working classes, in some cases at least, by the elite of themselves,
to have consented to put myself in the place of one of them if he had
fortunately been elected. The defeat of all the working class candidates
& of most of those of any other class in whom the working classes took
special interest, would have made my presence in the H of C of far less
use than it might perhaps have been if I had been one of a phalanx of
men of advanced opinions. I hope the working classes will learn from
their present failure a lesson of organisation, & as the liberal party
can never succeed at a general election without their active support,
will henceforth make such support conditional on being allowed an equal
voice in the selection of the liberal candidates, so that, whenever a
constituency returns two members one of these may be a man designated
by, & specially acceptable to, the liberals of the working classes.

had met Brown-Séquard, “who had just returned from America full of
enthusiasm for the [Northern] cause, and represents the state of opinion
there as highly satisfactory and still progressive.” In his Logic, 6th
ed. (1865), JSM introduced a section (III, xiii, 3; 8th ed., I, 555-56)
drawing on Brown-Séquard’s Lectures on the Physiology and Pathology of
the Central Nervous System (Philadelphia, 1860).

Cairnes had written (Feb. 5): “Goldwin Smith . . . is advocating peace
on the basis . . . of reconstruction with an admission of the right of
secession, which seems much like as if one were to rebuild a house whose
foundation had given way, having just given the architect directions
that on no account were the foundations to be restored.” These remarks
referred to two letters by Goldwin Smith, “The Prospects of Peace in
America,” Daily News, Jan. 28, 1865, p. 4, and Feb. 4, 1865, p. 4.

improperly induced to enter a Catholic nunnery by Father Bowden of the
Brompton Oratory. The Daily Telegraph reported the case on Jan. 6, p. 6;
on Jan. 9, pp. 4-5, in its second leader it attacked the Brompton
Oratory, summarized the case, and called for governmental visitation and
inspection of conventual establishments for both males and females. The
resultant controversy brought forth many letters both pro and con and
several more leaders in the Telegraph in January.

proportional representation and said, “Instead of the 50,000 returning

In his letter of March 13, Cairnes said: “I see my observations on

did not hit the mark; and I fear I must now relinquish the hope—I might
say the ambition—of doing this, as on the assumption that the exposition
I gave was correct—which you concede to me—I am unable to perceive where
the difficulty lies: in short the scientific problem seems to me to be

“I see you are in England again by your complimentary letter to the
Westminster electors [Letter 765, which had been published in the
newspapers on March 23 and 24]. You pay them a higher compliment than
they pay you. I am always in doubt about the origin of the word
compliment. It looks like a formation from comply, but I doubt it. I
suspect that complément is the original, though the present spelling and
usage is as old as the Academy’s Dictionary. I suspect that old forms of
civility were at last described as complements, fillings up; and that
complimts, at the end of a letter, meant that all usual forms are to be
understood. My theory receives a little support from comply not being a
French verb.”

judgment, in favour of Westerton and Beal, directed the removal of
crosses, altars, and candlesticks inconsistent with the practices of the
Church of England. See The Times, March 23, 1857, p. 10. Subsequently to

Times, April 21, p. 7. In reply to Beal’s of April 12, 1865, MS also at
Johns Hopkins. Elliot dates as of April 19, but see Letter 800. The MS
copy in the Chadwick collection at UCL is in Helen Taylor’s hand; the
last page of the MS copy contains JSM’s letter to Chadwick of April 17.

A statement purporting to be by JSM, in response to the request that he
be a candidate, in W. D. Christie’s article “Mr. John Stuart Mill for
Westminster” (Macmillan’s, XII [May, 1865], 92-96), is apparently
Christie’s paraphrase based upon JSM’s letter of March 7 and this one.

The meeting of Liberal electors was held in St. James’s Hall on
Thursday, April 6. JSM was not present, and was represented by Chadwick.
Others who spoke included John Roebuck, W. D. Christie, and Henry

shillings instead of 2s.6d as the agreement specified, and Pol. Econ. at
5s instead of 7s (on the first four thousand copies, after which the
price was to be reduced to 5s).

3.
Longman reported that he had been too cautious in printing the cheap
editions. After printing only 1000 each of Liberty and Rep. Govt., he
found it necessary to order 2000 more of each, and before these were
received, to order another 2000 of each.

Review, and if you ever happen to cast your eye on it I cannot doubt
that you will think it as simply mischievous . . . as any production can
possibly be.” Referring to his own article on the Encyclical and

that the statement is clear of principles which you will regard as
detestable.”

linguistic changes in the French language as they can be deduced from
the original of the epic through various changes made by contemporary

In his letter of transmittal to The Times, Harvey explained that JSM had
been asked the following: “Would the demand for the ballot by a very
large number of tradesmen and employés, who are, or are duly qualified
to be, on the electoral register, on the ground they object to being
canvassed by any person or party whatever, and many of the latter of
whom, as is well known, keep their assessed taxes unpaid until after the
20th of July to avoid being on the register and so escape being
canvassed, justify exceptional legislation in the form of the ballot
being permitted in boroughs in conjunction with open voting, each
elector having the option of using which of the two modes he preferred?”

co-operative movement. In a letter of May 21, 1865 (published in the

disagreement with the position of the Wolverhampton Plate Lock Makers’
Co-operative. See also the Co-operator, Aug. 15, 1865, p. 99 and Letters

Ward’s summary.

2.
Wilfrid Ward (pp. 280-81) cites the passage from JSM’s Hamilton chap.
vii (in which he attacks the views of Hamilton’s disciple, Henry Mansel,
on the limits of religious thought): “If, instead of the ‘glad tidings’
that there exists a Being in whom all the excellences which the highest
human mind can conceive, exist in a degree inconceivable to us, I am
informed that the world is ruled by a being whose attributes are
infinite, but what they are we cannot learn, nor what are the principles
of his government, except that ‘the highest human morality which we are
capable of conceiving’ does not sanction them; convince me of it, and I
will bear my fate as I may. But when I am told that I must believe this,
and at the same time call this being by the names which express and
affirm the highest human morality, I say in plain terms that I will not.
Whatever power such a being may have over me, there is one thing which
he shall not do: he shall not compel me to worship him. I will call no
being good, who is not what I mean when I apply that epithet to my
fellow creatures; and if such a being can sentence me to hell for not so
calling him, to hell I will go” (pp. 102-103).

Ward had written in his letter of July 17, 1865: “That I am not simply a
‘bigot’, in the ordinary sense, I persuade myself, were it only from my
great interest in everything you [JSM] write. I may take the opportunity
of saying how heartily I agree with the drift of that passage about God
which has so excited the bitterness of many Christians.” (See n. 2
above.)

5.
Ward had asked for help from JSM in preparing an essay on Galileo, which
appeared with the title “Doctrinal Decrees of a Pontifical
Congregation.—The Case of Galileo,” in Dublin Review, n.s. V (Oct.,
1865), 376-425. Ward quotes from JSM’s Hamilton in a footnote on p. 397.

Mansel with advocating “complete philosophical scepticism. . . . If
human morality and Divine are different in kind, we had better leave off
speaking of the Divine attributes at all. If ‘just,’ ‘merciful,’ ‘true,’
as predicated of God, do not mean what they do when predicated of men,
they are evidently utterly unmeaning to us.”

Probably one of several letters in an exchange between Lyttelton and the

Lyttelton’s letters appeared on April 19, pp. 387-88; May 10, p. 459;
June 7, p. 579; and June 28, p. 659.

The controversy had arisen over a sermon preached by Frederick Temple
(1821-1902), then headmaster of Rugby, later Archbishop of Canterbury,
as the fifth of the Lenten Sermons in the Chapel Royal, Whitehall. As
reported in the Guardian, April 5, 1865, Temple had said that attempts
to reconcile the account of the Creation in Genesis with the discoveries
of modern science were doomed to failure. “It was clear . . . that the
first chapter of Genesis was not the same thing they learned from
geology. . . . They had, in all probability, in that account of creation
a poem, just as the whole of the Apocalypse was a poem.” Lyttelton
defended Temple’s position.

Congreve had been converted to positivism in 1848, had resigned his
fellowship at Oriel in 1855, and had established a positivist community
that year.

2.
Congreve’s letter of Aug. 3, 1865, was one of courteously worded
complaint about JSM’s treatment of Comte and his ideas in the two essays
on Comte, published earlier this year. Congreve quoted as an example the
following sentence: “We cannot go on any longer with this trash.” The
sentence is in “Later Speculations of Auguste Comte,” WR, n.s. XXVIII
(July, 1865) p. 39. When reprinted in Auguste Comte and Positivism, the
sentence was changed to, “We cannot go on any longer with this.”

4.
A bill to permit all persons to make affirmations “where there is
inability to take an oath from defect or want of religious knowledge or
belief.” If JSM was referring to Trelawny’s Affirmations (Scotland)
Bill, it had finally been adopted the previous March and had received
Royal Assent (see The Times, April 8, 1865, p. 5). What JSM may well
have had in mind, however, was the continuing struggle to modify the
Parliamentary Oath, which was accomplished in the 1866 session. Not
until 1888, in the famous Bradlaugh case, was the Oath modified so as to
permit an atheist to take it. See W. L. Arnstein, The Bradlaugh Case
(Oxford, 1965), pp. 66-67, 317-18.

A society founded in response to a prize offered at the Paris Universal
Exposition for the best essay on the advantages of educating children of
different nationalities together. Richard Cobden was the first chairman.
The Society’s most important work was the establishment of schools in
Paris, Godesberg, and London. The one in London, International College,
opened in 1866 and lasted until 1889. Its curriculum stressed the study
of science and modern languages, and its student body included French,
Germans, Spaniards, Indians, and North and South Americans. The schools
on the Continent, however, failed because of the Franco-Prussian war.
The plan was outlined in “International Education,” the Reader, V (June
17, 1865), 678-79. For further details, see Cyril Bibby, T. H. Huxley
(New York, 1959), pp. 168-72.

“Irish Education,” Economist, Aug. 19, 1865, pp. 1000-1002. The occasion
for the letter was an attack upon the university system of Ireland by
Daniel O’Donoghue, MP for Tipperary, 1857-65, for Tralee, 1865-85. “The
O’Donoghue,” as he was known, in effect charged the system with being
discriminatory against Roman Catholics. For the attack and the ensuing
debate in Parliament, see Hansard, CLXXX, cols. 541-55.

Sic. Robert Lowe in 1859 became vice-president of the Council of
Education and was placed in charge of the distribution of public grants
to the schools of the kingdom. He was responsible for the “Revised Code”
of 1862 and a system of “payment by results” by the administration of
examinations in the three R’s. In 1864 Lowe was accused of altering the
reports of school inspectors (of whom Matthew Arnold was the best known)
to support his own views on education. Lowe was censured in the House of
Commons and resigned his office on April 18, 1864 (see Hansard, CLXXIV,
cols. 897 ff. and 1203 ff.). In the spring of 1865 a select committee
was appointed to investigate the matter and a report was issued on June
19, 1865 (see Parl. Papers, 1865, Reports of Committees, vol. VI). This
is probably the “official correspondence” to which JSM is referring.

In his letter of Aug. 28, 1865, Cairnes doubted whether JSM’s suggestion
(in Letter 868) not to permit anyone to serve on the Senate of Queen’s
University who did not believe in the mixed educational system was a
feasible solution to the Irish university problem. Cairnes further
pointed out that if entirely Roman Catholic institutions were placed
under Queen’s University, that too would change the mixed system.

Probably copies of speeches printed in numbers of the Liberator or the
National Anti-Slavery Standard rather than the 1863 collected edition of
Phillips’s speeches, which does not contain speeches referred to in this
letter. Four of these have been located: one of Oct. 20, 1864, on “The
Presidential Election,” at the Tremont Temple, Boston, published in the
National Anti-Slavery Standard, Nov. 5, 1864; two on Jan. 26, 1865, at
the annual meeting of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, published
in the Liberator, Feb. 10 and 17, 1865; one on May 9, 1865, at the 32nd
anniversary meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society at the Church
of the Puritans in New York City, published in the National Anti-Slavery
Standard of May 13 and in the Liberator of May 19. Major emphasis in all
four speeches was upon advocating the immediate extension of the
suffrage to the emancipated slaves as well as to poor whites.

3.
In his speech of May 9 Phillips had said: “In Revolutionary times, every
man in this country, black and white, who was born free, except in South
Carolina, voted—with the limitation, in some of the States, of a
property qualification. Our fathers were too wise to require book
learning as a preliminary condition of the ballot. I am surprised, and
marvel greatly, that so masterly a mind as Stuart Mill should proclaim
that in his theory a man must read before he votes. Does he not remember
that for four men out of five, education does not come from books? Does
he suppose there was no education in the world before printing was
invented? . . . The mass of men have their faculties educated by work,
not by reading. . . .”

4.
As early as Oct., 1851, at a convention at Worcester, Mass., Phillips
had presented resolutions on women’s rights in part framed from Mrs.
Mill’s WR article, “Enfranchisement of Women.” See “Woman’s Rights,” in
Phillips’s Speeches, Lectures, and Letters (Boston, 1863), pp. 11-34.

In his speech of May 9, 1865, Phillips had advocated a constitutional
amendment that “ ‘No state shall ever make any distinctions in civil
privileges among those born on her soil . . . on account of race, color,
or condition.’ I hope in time to be as bold as Stuart Mill, and add to
that last clause ‘sex’. But this hour belongs to the Negro.”

Wakeman did not remain good-tempered towards JSM. The following
quotation from Wakeman’s letter of Nov. 23, 1865, is typical of his
attitude towards all Englishmen and of the tone of all his letters: “I
have just got through reading your essay on liberty, or the right of
thought and free discussion. You certainly have indulged this right with
a vengeance. You appear to be a man of education, and some reading, yet
lack the great essentials of manhood, namely sound morals, common sense,
and honesty.”

Gurowski to Horatio Woodman of April 9, 1866, published in Mass. Hist.
Soc. Proceedings, LVI (Jan., 1923), pp. 238-39. According to Fischer,
the passage was also quoted in a letter to Gerrit Smith, Nov. 16, 1865
(MS in Archives and Museum, Polish Roman Catholic Union of America).
Gurowski wrote Woodman: “Before I published this third volume [of his
Diary] I asked advise [sic] of John Stuart Mill. He is impartial and
disinterested. Herewith an extract from his letter, for such use as you
will find proper. I asked the opinion of Mill, because I was puzzled by
the abuse showered upon me [because of the first two volumes of his
published Diary] . . . (Mill is my friend of more than thirty-five years
standing and I asked his advice as that of a physician for a disease.)”
The Diary contains a number of highly laudatory comments on JSM,
including this one, under the date of Feb. 8, 1864: “I wish every
American would read and learn J. S. Mill’s book on Liberty, in the same
way as most of them learn the Scriptures. Many, very many verses of
Mill’s gospel are more full of life than some of the worshipped Hebrew
hallucinations” (Diary, III, p. 96).

Count Adam Gurowski (1805-1866), Polish author and agitator, in exile
from his native country. JSM had become acquainted with him in Paris in
the 1830’s, possibly through Mazzini, Godefroi Cavaignac, or mutual
Saint-Simonian friends. In 1849 Gurowski emigrated to the United States,
where he engaged chiefly in journalism.

2.
In England. The first two volumes of Gurowski’s Diary had been published
in America (vol. I, Boston, 1862; vol. II, New York, 1864). Gurowski had
sent JSM a proof copy of vol. III before publication in Washington,
1866. The Diary concerns chiefly the Washington political scene during
the Civil War, and contains many severely critical comments on Lincoln
and his secretary of state, William Seward. JSM declined either to edit
an English edition or to write an introduction to it (see next Letter),
and no English edition appears to have been published.

motives, which their correspondent doubted, was complaints from the
French press that foreign newspapers were given far more freedom than
domestic ones to criticize the government of Louis Napoleon. The ban was
lifted on Feb. 1, 1866. See The Times, Jan. 16, 1866, p. 4.

To judge from contemporary accounts, these exhibitions were designed for
the display of artifacts created during the leisure hours of working
men. They were also for the promotion of “union and good feeling between
rich and poor.” See Morning Advertiser, March 24, April 3, and April 5,
1865. Working men did not always find to their liking the condescension
implicit in the exhibitions. See the Working Man, Jan. 3, 1866, p. 5.

Alfred Denison, Esq., probably Alfred Robert Denison (b. 1817); B.A.
Cambridge, 1839; later a settler in New South Wales. He was the brother
of John Evelyn Denison, later Viscount Ossington (1800-1873), who became
Speaker in 1857 and retired from the office in 1872.

2.
The tradition of the Speaker’s dinners appears to have been established
in the late eighteenth century. To be invited to one was generally
regarded as constituting full social recognition. Convention for
attending such dinners required the wearing of uniform or Court dress.
John Bright at the opening of the session on Feb. 1 had protested
against the requirement (see Hansard, CLXXXI,cols. 8-11). Later in the
century as working-class representatives became common in Parliament
more protests were made. For a full account of the traditions of the
Speaker’s dinners, see Arnold Wright and Philip Smith, Parliament Past

As reported to the national conference of the Reform League, Feb. 28,
1866, at St. Martin’s Hall, London, the draft bill called for one member
of Parliament for every 50,000 inhabitants; a residential requirement
for electoral districts determined by municipal, parochial, and county
boundaries; a superintendent of elections as a permanent officer of the
House of Commons; universal suffrage, except for criminals and paupers;
relief from electoral expenses for all candidates; the secret ballot.
Montague Leverson introduced the bill and gave it to a committee of
twelve, which was charged with reporting it to the conference. See the
Commonwealth, March 3, 1866; see also Montague Leverson, The Reformers’
Reform Bill: being a proposed complete code of electoral law for the
United Kingdom (London, 1866).

MS not located. Published in the Diplomatic Review, July 4, 1866, p. 91,
under the title, “Mr. John Stuart Mill on the Right of Search,” with a
note on Mawby’s letter to JSM to which this is a reply, and Mawby’s
rejoinder of July 1, 1866.

Mawby was evidently the secretary or chairman of the Foreign Affairs
Committee, of Bamford, near Hathersage, from which his letters to JSM
were addressed. Such committees, composed of working men, had been
formed in a number of communities under the stimulus of David Urquhart,
owner and editor of the Diplomatic Review.

2.
William Henry Gregory, later Sir William, K.C.M.G. (1817-1892), MP for
Galway (1857-71), on March 2, 1866, moved in Commons an address to the
Queen “for the purpose of making the principle that private property
should be free from capture by sea a maxim of International Maritime
Law.” At the end of the debate he withdrew the address and its
amendments. See Hansard, CLXXXI, 1407-80.

3.
The Declaration of Paris, adopted in 1856 at the conclusion of the
negotiations for the Treaty of Paris, was signed by England, France,
Russia, Prussia, Austria, Sardinia, and Turkey. The Declaration dealt
with maritime neutrality; it declared privateering abolished and ruled
that blockades in order to be binding must be effective. The most
important articles, 2 and 3, declared that the neutral flag covers an
enemy’s goods, with the exception of contraband of war, and that neutral
goods, with the exception of contraband of war, are not liable to
capture under an enemy’s flag.

See Letter 916. JSM, Huxley, and others arranged to take up a number of
subscriptions to Spencer’s writings and hoped to have others purchase
them so that he could continue to publish. Meanwhile some Americans

both arrangements and for details, see Spencer, Autobiography, II,
154-67, 573-75.

bill was sponsored by Gladstone, the chancellor of the exchequer, and
Hugh Childers, MP for Pontefract and financial secretary to the
treasury.

Bill, a bill to permit nonconformists to take the M.A. and thus become
members of Convocation, the governing body of Oxford. The debate took
place March 21, 1866, and though the bill passed the second reading, it
was later withdrawn. A similar bill became law in 1871. Among the Tories
who spoke against the bill were the two from Stamford—Sir Stafford
Northcote and Viscount Cranbourne—and the two from Oxford
University—Gathorne Hardy and Sir William Heathcote. See Hansard,
CLXXXII, cols. 659-715.

University Education in Ireland, a Letter to J. S. Mill (London, 1866).

1.
MS draft at NLS, with a typed copy, headed by the following note,
presumably by Alexander Carlyle: “The lost letter of Mill’s [sic] to
Carlyle, which gave some offence to JWC [Jane Welsh Carlyle]. This copy
is from Mill’s rough draft which was, and I suppose is, among Carlyle’s
Letters to Mill, now in the Carlyle House in Chelsea.” How this draft
could have been preserved among Carlyle’s papers remains a mystery. The
letter was in answer to Carlyle’s of March 13, 1866, published in
Letters of Thomas Carlyle to John Stuart Mill, John Sterling and Robert
Browning, ed. A. Carlyle, pp. 185-86. Jane Carlyle’s letter of April 13
to her husband is in Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle, ed. J.

“Such terms as Nature, Law, Freedom, Necessity, Body, Substance, Matter,
Church, State, Revelation, Inspiration, Knowledge, Belief, are tossed
about in the wars of words as if everybody knew what they meant and as
if everybody used them exactly in the same sense; whereas most people,
and particularly those who represent public opinion, pick up these
complicated terms as children, beginning with the vaguest conceptions,
adding to them from time to time, perhaps correcting likewise at
haphazard some of their involuntary errors, but never taking stock,
never either inquiring into the history of the terms which they handle
so freely, or realising the fulness of their meaning according to the
strict rules of logical definition.” “Grote’s Plato,” ER, CXXIII (April,

In his long letter of May 15 Grey had urged JSM to propose an amendment
to the Reform Bill to provide for the cumulative vote: “You would very
materially contribute to the settlement of this question, if you would
make the proposal for adopting the ‘cumulative vote’, & my recollection
of the very decided approval of it you have expressed in your writings,
leads me to hope that you may be prevailed upon to do so. . . .

“. . . I am certain that your making the suggestion, wd afford by far
the best chance for getting it adopted.—It wd come with an authority
from you that no one else cd give it, & I cannot but think that if you
were previously to communicate with the Ministers on the subject, you
might induce them to agree to it. . . .”

To permit a meeting of Reformers to be held Monday, July 30, in Hyde
Park. A government prohibition of such a meeting, originally scheduled
for July 23, led to rioting by a crowd that remained behind after Beales
and many of his fellow reformers went off to Trafalgar Square, after
finding the gates of Hyde Park locked and guarded by police. In the
ensuing riot many were injured. Beales and other officers of the Reform
League called on Spencer Walpole, the Home Secretary, on July 25; they
left with the impression that Hyde Park would be open to them for the
meeting on July 30. In the event, however, the park was prohibited, and
the meeting was held at Agricultural Hall, Islington. See The Times,

“On the whole it seems to us that though Mr. Mill will consent to
worship only a God of goodness, he has thrown no light on the grave
problem . . . how such a conception of God is to be reconciled with the
extent of evil and suffering actually prevailing throughout the earth.”
From George Grote’s review: “John Stuart Mill on the Philosophy of Sir
William Hamilton,” WR, n.s. XXIX (Jan., 1866), p. 18.

4.
Pharazyn had written: “The conclusion at which I have long since arrived
is this: ‘That no proof of the existence of a God can be given, nor of
the nature of his attributes; in short that the question is an insoluble
one in any strictly scientific sense.’ But of course it is objected, if
there is no proof of there being a good God there may be a bad one, and
so we fall back on orthodox myths, or at best ‘intuitions’, to avoid
this shocking possibility of belief, of the effects of which African
fetichism and American psychomancy are examples and warnings. There is
something of this argument not only in the ‘Eclipse of Faith’ sort of
books, but in the ‘Phases’ of the one Newman and the ‘Apologia’ of the
other, and indeed it gives a tinge to all Theistic as well as
Theological reasoning, and constitutes the half-conscious philosophy of
popular religion. Now it seems to me that the real answer to all this is
not logical at all, but practical, though in a wide sense it is logical
too, as ‘is the proof of the principle of utility,’ ‘for questions of
ultimate ends do not admit of proof, in the ordinary acceptation of the
term.’ ” (Pharazyn is quoting, inexactly, from chap. I of JSM’s
Utilitarianism.)

Mr. Mill, from General Briggs, the First Commissioner of Mysore; Sir
John Low, late member of the Supreme Council of India; General Fraser,
late resident at Hyderabad and at Mysore; Colonel Haines, late Judicial
Commissioner at Mysore; General Jacob, late Commissioner of the Southern
Mahratta Country; Sir Robert Hamilton, late agent to the Viceroy in
Central India; and about 50 others, praying that the House will take
steps for preventing the annexation of Mysore, and for maintaining that
tributary state with every possible security for British interests and
for the prosperity of the people of the country.” Morley quotes from the
Petition in his article, pp. 268-69.

4.
James Andrew Broun Ramsay, 10th Earl and 1st Marquis of Dalhousie
(1812-1860), Governor-General of India, 1848-56, was criticized by many
for his annexation policy. He extended British dominion both by conquest
and by taking over native states when their rulers died without natural
heirs.

Mills had written (p. 11): “In the case of the Bank Act, however, it has
been forcibly argued by Mr. John Stuart Mill that this authorized
departure from the letter of the Act in times of crisis is in reality a
more effectual carrying out of its spirit.” Then Mills cites this
passage from JSM: “The opportune relief thus afforded to credit . . .
and almost all the losses and failures attended on it are consummated.”
(Pol. Econ. [6th ed.], Book III, chap. 24, sec. 4.) In a footnote on pp.
18-19 Mills defended his citing of the passage from JSM, on the ground
that he had quoted from the latest edition of the Pol. Econ.

majority of 8 against 6.

“This decision has been the means of preserving the Chair from being

had incessant agitation during the interval, and the matter would
infallibly have ended in a compromise, suppressing the Chair outright”
(p. 282).

Address, as reported in The Times of Feb. 4: “Christianity being an
historical religion, the sort of religious instruction which seems to be
most appropriate to a University is the study of ecclesiastical
history.”

In his letter, Fowle proposed to extend this principle to the schools:
“The Bible whatever else it may be contains the two first volumes of
religious history. It should therefore be taught . . . not dogmatically
but historically, and exactly under the conditions and in that spirit
which you [JSM] have prescribed as legitimate in national Universities.”

In part, JSM said, “In cultivating, therefore, the ancient languages as
our best literary tradition, we are all the while laying an admirable
foundation for ethical and philosophical culture.”

3.
Nothing came of these plans. The next semi-popular periodical to be
established which included news of scientific interest was Nature, first
published in Nov., 1869, by Macmillan as a weekly. See Cyril Bibby, T.

before bringing in a bill. This method of introducing the subject was
debated Feb. 18, 1867, and Gladstone gave his approval. See Hansard,
CLXXXV, cols. 480-91.

That evening he gave notice that, in Committee on the subject of the
representation of the people, he would move, “That in order to secure to
the utmost extent possible the real and equal representation of every
elector, it is expedient that when the electors amount to a certain
number they shall have the power of voluntarily combining with one
another to elect their own representative.” See The Times, Feb. 20,

As reported in “The Government Reform Bill,” the Star, Feb. 28, 1867, p.
2, the speakers (Charles Bradlaugh and Lt.-Col. L. S. Dickson) at the
Reform League rally, held the preceding evening in Sussex Hall, Bouverie
Street, London, were demagogic in their utterances. They proposed that a
demonstration be held on Good Friday in Hyde Park and that a general
strike be called as a means of obtaining votes for the working class.

3.
The Reform League was largely, though not exclusively, a working-class
organization, formed in 1865 by the Trade Unions. Its principles
reflected the Chartists’ demands for “One Man, One Vote.” Its president
was Edmond Beales; its secretary, George Howell. W. R. Cremer of the
Carpenters and Joiners Society was a member of the General Council. See
F. E. Gillespie, Labor and Politics in England 1850-1865 (Durham, N.C.,

Although JSM urged the necessity of large rather than small districts

(Hansard, ibid., cols. 266-357). JSM opposed the amendment on the ground
that it would lead to expensive politicking and perhaps to traffic in
votes; the amendment passed, however, with a majority of 66.

success.”

JSM had spoken at a meeting of the National Reform Union on May 25,

William Wotherspoon Ireland (1832-1909), a physician in the service of
the East India Co. who had been badly wounded at the siege of Delhi in
Aug., 1857. After early retirement he lived for some time on the
Continent, for a while in 1863 at Avignon, where he may have met JSM.
Ireland’s “Town Life in the South of France,” in his Studies of a
Wandering Observer (London, 1867), presents a picture of Avignon in this
period.

2.
JSM had spoken in the Commons on June 14, 1867, in an acrimonious debate
over a “Petition on Fenianism” presented some weeks earlier by John
Bright. The Petition attempted to justify the Irish rebellion and
pleaded for as lenient punishment of the Fenians as possible; it also
seemed to censure the British Army for its previous conduct in Ireland
(1798), India, and Jamaica. Criticism of the Petition was led by Major
Augustus Henry Archibald Anson, then MP for Lichfield. Anson, who had
performed distinguished service in India during the Mutiny, thought the
Petition insulting to the armed forces.

JSM endorsed the sentiments of the Petition and denied that it was
directed against Major Anson’s profession. He said, in part, “I have
been infinitely more disgusted in reference to the Indian transactions .
. . by the inhuman and ferocious displays of feeling made by unmilitary
persons, persons in civil life, who were safe at home, and who, it seems
to me were far more culpable than those who committed excesses under
such provocation as there is no denying was given in the case of India.
Even the deeds there done of inhuman and indiscriminate massacre, the
seizing of persons in all parts of the country and putting them to death
without trial, and then boasting of it in a manner almost disgraceful to
humanity, were by no means confined to the army. . . .” For the whole
debate, see Hansard, CLXXXVII, cols. 1886-1906.

Henry Fawcett on June 18 had presented a motion to open fellowships and
foundation scholarships of Trinity College, Dublin, to persons other
than members of the Established Church.

3.
William Monsell, later Baron Emly (1812-1894), politician and statesman,
MP for Limerick, 1847-74, moved to amend Fawcett’s motion so as to
provide for the alteration of the constitution of the University of
Dublin “to enable . . . it to include Colleges connected with other
forms of religion than that of the Established Church, and that the
members of such colleges should be entitled to share in all the benefits
now enjoyed by the members of Trinity College.” See Hansard, CLXXXVIII,
cols. 58-63.

4.
As announced in the papers on July 6, 1867, it was named “The London
National Society for Woman Suffrage.” As correspondence at LSE between
Helen Taylor and Clementia Taylor reveals, Helen threatened that she and
JSM would withdraw unless the name was altered. On July 22 the Committee
yielded, and the name henceforth used was “The London National Society
for Women’s Suffrage.”

A breakfast in honour of William Lloyd Garrison, the American
abolitionist, was held at St. James’s Hall, London, on June 29, 1867.
John Bright spoke, followed by the Duke of Argyll, Earl Russell, JSM,
and others. The text of JSM’s speech is printed in W. P. Garrison and F.
J. Garrison, William Lloyd Garrison, 1805-1879 . . . (4 vols. New York,
1889), IV, 211-13.

8.
JSM spoke at meetings of the National Reform Union at St. James’s Hall
on May 25 (see Letter 1091) and on June 28, on the latter occasion when
he was unexpectedly called upon.

9.
The Daily News for June 29, 1867, p. 5, reported that at the close of
the meeting, before a motion of thanks to the Chairman, Jacob Bright,
was put to vote, “a lady in a sailor’s hat . . . came forward and made a
long oration on the subject of women’s political rights. She called for
a show of hands in favour of Mr. Mill’s proposition to admit women to
the suffrage, and the meeting, which had half dwindled away, cordially
answered the appeal.”

The lady was Mrs. Harriet Law (1832-1897), well known as a lecturer on
secularist topics. Two years earlier the National Reformer (May 28,
1865, pp. 348-49), in a piece entitled “Mrs. Law’s Provincial Tour,” had
reported that her lecture at Birmingham “was a comparison of the
teaching of Moses, Jesus and Mill on Political Economy, in which the
wisdom of the latter and the foolishness of the former were judiciously
shown. Moses and Jesus, in almost everything they said on this subject,
were shown to be in direct opposition to the teachings of Mill, and
other great political economists of the present time. And in everything
they differed, although God-inspired men, their differences only tended
to render their teachings absurd, useless, and contradictory.”

In June, 1867, Mrs. Law became the first woman member of the General
Council of the International. From 1872 to 1879 she edited the Secular
Chronicle (published at Birmingham), which printed a number of the
writings of Karl Marx.

R.N., as head of the Naval Council to the Turkish Government (a body
formed to reorganize the Turkish navy) would be suspended until the
hostilities caused by the Cretan insurrection against Turkey were at an
end. JSM had asked whether it was consistent with Britain’s
non-intervention policy to send Commodore Wiseman to the Turkish post.
Stanley agreed to JSM’s interpretation only after questions at two
meetings of the Commons on July 16 and 22, 1867. Hansard, CLXXXVIII,
cols. 1621-22, and 1873. The further question mentioned here was not
raised until Monday, July 22.

with India. See Hansard, CLXXXVIII, cols. 1624-26.

A “Meetings in Royal Parks Bill” which sought to limit the right of free
assembly by declaring “that any meeting held in Royal Parks without the
permission of the Crown should be an illegal assembly.” JSM in the
Commons on the day preceding this letter had spoken vigorously in
defence of holding political meetings in the Parks: “And why do I desire
this? Because it has been for centuries the pride of this country . . .
that a man has a right to speak his mind, on politics or any other
subject, to those who would listen to him, when and where he will. He
has not a right to force himself upon anyone; he has not a right to
intrude upon private property; but wheresoever he has a right to be,
there, according to the Constitution of this country, he has a right to
talk politics, to one, to fifty, or to 50,000 persons. I stand up for
the right of doing this in the Parks. . . .” Hansard, CLXXXVIII, col.
1890. The Bill was further debated on July 29 and Aug. 13. On the latter
occasion JSM again spoke (see Hansard, CLXXXIX, cols. 1482-84).

tireless worker for the cause of Labour.

Beesly, in a speech at Exeter Hall, July 2, 1867, tried to combat the
wave of hostility towards trades unions which resulted from the
Sheffield “outrages” of Oct., 1866. He in turn criticized the rich for
not dissociating themselves from Gov. Eyre, and the middle classes for
their indignation against unions, which could only hinder the cause of
reform. Punch took to calling him “Professor Beastly,” and Sir Francis
Goldsmid at a meeting of the University College Council proposed that
Beesly be dismissed for his indiscretion in the speech and for two
letters published in the Daily News on July 9 and 10. Grote, though
annoyed by Beesly’s tactlessness, managed to shelve Goldsmid’s motion,
and nothing further was attempted. See H. H. Bellot, University College,

Miss Nightingale in her reply of Aug. 11, while expressing her belief in
women’s right to the suffrage, indicated that women currently suffered
even more serious disabilities than the lack of a vote. She protested
that she had no time to serve the society: “Otherwise, there is scarcely
anything which, if you were to tell me that it is right to do
politically, I would not do. But I could not give my name without my
work. This is only personal (I am an incurable invalid). I entirely
agree that women’s ‘political power’ should be ‘direct and open.’ But I
have thought that I could work better for others, even other women, off
the stage than on it.” See also Letter 1169.

Stephen Thomas Hawtrey (1808-1886), head mathematics master at Eton,
1836-71; founder of St. Mark’s School, Windsor, 1851, and warden of it,
1871-86.

Probably A Letter containing an account of St. Mark’s School, Windsor,
and Embodying some suggestions on the Subject of Education (London,
1859), reprinted from a letter in The Times of Dec., 1858, giving an
account of a visit to the School.

The other book no doubt was Reminiscences of a French Eton (London,
1867), mostly consisting of a letter of Sept. 5, 1863, to Matthew Arnold
on the latter’s A French Eton. Hawtrey described his own two years in a
Lycée. He quotes from JSM’s Rectorial Address: “It is beyond the power
of schools and universities to educate morally or religiously” (pp.
8-9).

His letter, published as a pamphlet, reached nine editions in its first
year: On the means of rendering more efficient the education of the
people (London, 1846).

The only extant letter of Emerson to JSM in these years appears to be
one of May 6, 1865, listed but not published in Letters of Ralph Waldo
Emerson, ed. R. L. Rusk (6 vols., New York, 1939), V, 415. The letter,
introducing George Walker of Springfield, Mass., was subsequently
published in More Books, The Bulletin of the Boston Public Library, XV
(Dec., 1940), 436-37.

during the debate on Aug. 12 on the East India Revenue Accounts. See
Hansard, CLXXXIX, cols. 1382-87.

4.
This debate on Aug. 2 concerned the famine in Orissa (Bengal) during
which it was estimated that 750,000 persons had perished. For a
contemporary discussion, see “The Famine in Orissa,” Fraser’s, LXXVI
(Sept., 1867), 373-82.

In the course of the debate Viscount Cranborne said of JSM that he had
“by his works been a great benefactor to mankind. But there was a
curious reverse to the coin. No man’s authority had been more
systematically mis-used than his by unintelligent officials in
propagating mischievous error. In Australia his authority had been used
on the side of protection; in Bengal for starving some 750,000 persons.
The doctrine of politicaleconomy had been worshipped as a sort of
‘fetish’ by officials who, because they believed that in the long run
supply and demand would square themselves, seemed to have utterly
forgotten that human life was short, and that man could not subsist
without food beyond a few days. They mechanically left the laws of
political economy to work themselves out while hundreds of thousands of
human beings were perishing from famine.” See Hansard, ibid., cols.
810-11.

Evidently the sponsors of the “Education of the Poor Bill,” which had
its first reading on April 5, 1867, its second on July 10, and was
withdrawn on July 15. The sponsors of the Bill were Henry Austin Bruce,
MP for Merthyr Tydvil; William E. Forster, MP for Bradford; and Algernon
Egerton, MP for South Lancashire. They were called the “Manchester
party” evidently because they hoped that the bill would first take
effect in Manchester.

4.

“In all Languages, the Verb which denotes EXISTENCE has been employed to
answer the additional purpose of the Copula in Predication. The
consequences of this have been most lamentable. There is thus a double
meaning in the Copula, which has produced a most unfortunate mixture and
confusion of ideas. It has involved in mystery the whole business of
Predication; the grand contrivance by which language is rendered
competent to its end. . . .” For the full discussion, see James Mill,

“Mr. J. S. Mill has made a powerful defence of the so-called
Psychological Method [in his books on Comte and Hamilton]. . . . He has
said all that can be said in favour of the Psychological Method, and has
done what could be done to disparage the Physiological Method. . . .
Physiology seems never to have been a favourite study with Mr. Mill, for
it is hardly possible to conceive any one really acquainted with the
present state of this science, disparaging it as he has done, and
exalting so highly the psychological method of investigating mental
phenomena. . . .” Maudsley, Physiology and Pathology of the Mind, p. 37,
n. 6.

“Culture is always assigning to the system-maker and the system a
smaller share in the bent of human destiny than their friends like. . .
. Culture tends always thus to deal with the men of a system, with
disciples, of a school with men like Comte, or the late Mr. Buckle, or
Mr. Mill. It remembers the text: ‘Be not ye called Rabbi!’ and it soon
passes on from any Rabbi.” Matthew Arnold, “Culture and its Enemies,”
Cornhill Mag., XVI (July, 1867), p. 51. This was originally delivered as
Arnold’s last lecture as Professor of Poetry at Oxford; it was

The Fenians, or Fenian Brotherhood, were an Irish-American revolutionary
secret society founded in America in 1858. The most notable of the
recent Fenian outrages in England had been the attempted destruction of
the Middlesex House of Detention in Clerkenwell on Dec. 13, 1867. A
group of Fenians blew up a section of the prison wall but failed either
to destroy the prison or to rescue the two Fenians held within. The
explosion killed six people and injured 120, many of them inhabitants of
the district. For the reaction to this event and to other Fenian
demonstrations and breaches of the peace, see Sp., Dec. 14, p. 1401, and

Not identifiable, and perhaps not published, since Bernays, in his
letter of Jan. 3, implies that the pamphlet is in MS. The author of the
pamphlet was Ellen Julia (Teed) Hollond (1822-1884), whom Bernays
identified by two of her writings: Channing, sa vie et ses œuvres
(Paris, 1857), and La vie de village en Angleterre, ou Souvenirs d’un
exilé (Paris, 1862). Her Parisian salon was a centre for liberal
intellectuals.

Longman had offered £200 to print 1,000 copies of the two-volume octavo
edition, and £650 for the right of publishing 10,000 copies of a cheaper
edition, to sell at 7s. 6d. A cancelled passage in the draft indicates
that JSM objected to the condition that if an agreement could not be
reached after five years the stereotype plates should be destroyed
rather than revert to JSM, as in the case of the other cheap editions.

edition of JSM’s works in the translation of Adolf Wahrmund (1827-1913).

4.
Probably Wilhelm Ferdinand Sattler, philologist, professor of English at
a Bremen Gymnasium. Sattler’s translation of the essay on Comte did not
satisfy Gomperz, and the translation published in the German collected
edition was by Elise Gomperz, his wife, whom he married onAug. 8, 1868.

In a footnote at the end of chap. xviii, Book III, JSM referred to
Venn’s book as “one of the most thoughtful and philosophical treatises
on any subject connected with Logic and Evidence, which have been
produced, to my knowledge, for many years. Some criticisms contained in
it have been very useful to me in revising the corresponding chapters of
the present work. . . .”

5.
In his preface (p. xiii) Venn had said, “Almost the only writer who
seems to me to have expressed a just view of the nature and foundation
of the rules of Probability is Mr. Mill, in his System of Logic. His
treatment of the subject is however very brief. . . . There are moreover
some errors . . . in what he has written, which will be referred to in
some of the following chapters.”

2.
On Feb. 18, 1868, the Jamaica Committee had resolved to proceed further
against Governor Eyre, even though at a hearing in Shropshire, in March,
1867, Eyre had been discharged as an accessory to murder, and a grand
jury had refused to indict two associates of Eyre for murder in April,
1867. In his letter of Feb. 19, 1868, Aspland explained that he was
resigning from the Jamaica Committee because he believed that further
prosecution would make Eyre a martyr and thereby weaken the effect of
the principles established by the charge which Lord Chief Justice
Alexander Cockburn had given on April 10, 1867, to the grand jury, a
charge which the jury had nevertheless ignored by refusing to indict.
For further details, see Bernard Semmel, The Governor Eyre Controversy,
pp. 147-64.

3.
In Jan. Eyre had moved from Shropshire to London, thereby coming within
the jurisdiction of the Middlesex courts. In informing the Jamaica
Committee of this move, Eyre was in effect challenging it to prosecute
him.

The debate took place on March 10, 12, 13, and 16, 1868. Neither
Disraeli nor Gladstone spoke until March 16. JSM spoke mostly on the
subject of land tenure. For the whole debate, see Hansard, CXC, cols.

The House of Representatives had begun consideration of a bill that
would have granted equal rights to American citizens, whether native or
naturalized. The bill would also have given the President the right to
detain a subject of any foreign power that had detained an American. In
part, the bill sprang from American anger over British treatment of the
Fenians. This bill was eventually dropped, and a substitute bill adopted
in June, 1868. For a conciliatory leader, see The Times, Feb. 12, 1868,

conference on Hare’s scheme of proportional representation first held in
the rooms of the Reform League, Adelphi Terrace, on Feb. 28, 1868. JSM
attended and spoke. Though generally sceptical of Hare’s plan, The Times
leader did concede it some virtues: “We do not suppose the adoption of
Mr. Hare’s scheme to the wide extent he himself recommends will ever be
seriously contemplated; but it will be seen that its principle offers a
means of reconciling the idea of equality with the maintenance of
representative government. . . .”

Three further such conferences were held, on March 7, 21, and June 13.

Florence May (1845-1923), daughter of Edward Collett May (1806-1887),
organist and singing teacher, professor of vocal music at Queen’s
College, London, from 1880; she was later a student of Clara Schumann
and of Brahms; concert pianist and teacher; author of biographies of
Brahms (1905) and of Clara Schumann (1912).

2.
Miss May had written in her letter to Helen Taylor: “there seems to me
nothing more melancholy than the waste of mind & energy wh. goes on
amongst women, no more bitter thought than that of the aimless,
objectless life they are compelled to lead. Then again there is their
want of occupation—What can girls living at home do? Just nothing except
lead, as it were, a kind of hand-to-mouth existence killing time in
small daily parcels with little frivolous amusements or at most with
foolish, petty pretences of work. They can have no centre, no end in
their lives, nothing to strive & work & live for, & so their energies
are deadened and their talents wasted & their lives thrown away so that
it wd almost seem better for them never to have lived at all. I know, at
least, that this is so with me. I have a most passionate longing for
work, but where is the possibility of finding any? It was this problem
wh. caused me to send my paper to Mr. Mill.”

head of the Government, whether he intended “to propose any measure,
either separately or as a provision, in the Election Petitions and
Corrupt Practices at Elections Bill, for the prevention of bribery at
Municipal Elections?” Disraeli in his answer promised to try to carry
the bill as it referred to Parliamentary elections, but refused to mix
up that bill with the question of Municipal Elections. Hansard, CXCI,

Trask, in his letter of April 20, identified himself as a Poor Law
Guardian (a local administrator) of Yeovil, Somerset. Seeking to
eliminate abuses of the Poor Law by able-bodied paupers, Trask proposed
the founding of a National Friendly Society—in effect an insurance

This refers to a passage in Utilitarianism, pp. 51-52, 1st ed. (audible,
visible—desirable). Gomperz regretted that JSM in the later editions of
Utilitarianism did not “remove the stumbling-block (to any reader, and
more especially to a translator),” which, when pointed out to him, JSM
had promised to remove. Gomperz says JSM’s argument “looks like a verbal
quibble, far as it is from being one and has besides the serious
disadvantage of being utterly untranslatable” (Gomperz to JSM, 26 March
1868). JSM did not revise the passage (see Collected Works, X, 234).

Grote had contended that the “original MSS of Plato . . . were doubtless
treasured up in the school [the Academy at Athens] as sacred memorials
of the great founder, and served as originals from which copies of
unquestionable fidelity might be made.” Plato, vol. I, chap. iv,
“Platonic Canon as recognized by Thrasyllus,” p. 135. For Grote’s
discussion of the existence of this school-library of manuscripts, see
ibid., pp. 136-37. Gomperz believed that such a school-library in all
probability had not existed, and in his Inaugural Lecture on July 10,
1867, “Die angebliche Platonische Schulbibliothek und die Testamente der
Philosophen,” later published in Platonische Aufsätze, vol. II (Vienna,
1887), he had developed his reasons for his opinion. See also Gomperz,

George Capel, clergyman, who conducted a small boarding school at
Carshalton. He had been a close friend of Henry Thomas Buckle.

2.
In the 7th ed. (1868) of the Logic, II, 535, JSM introduced a long
footnote to VI, xi, 2 (8th ed., II, 537), quoting from Capel’s letter of
Nov. 3, 1866 (MS also at LSE), defending Buckle from the suggestion JSM
had advanced in the 5th ed. of the Logic (1865) that Buckle had inferred
in his History of Civilization that “the moral qualities of mankind are
little capable of being improved, or are of little importance in the
general progress of society, compared with intellectual or economic
causes” (5th ed., pp. 528-29).

3.
As JSM thought likely, the discussion in committee was delayed by the
debate on the Representation of the People (Ireland) Bill. The Cattle
Market Bill was discussed on June 26, July 3, 16, 20, and 24, and
finally was withdrawn on July 25, 1868.

Pratten had asked on behalf of some of JSM’s constituents whether he
concurred with the petition he had presented in the Commons on June 5
from the Home and Foreign Affairs Association of Macclesfield. The
petition was described as “representing the injustice of the Abyssinian
War, and praying that the House will not confer its thanks upon the
General and the Army, and will appoint a Select Committee to inquire
into the whole of the transactions relating to Abyssinia” (The Times,
June 6, 1868), p. 4.

An expedition had been authorized in July, 1867, to procure the release
of British prisoners, including the British consul, held by King
Theodore III of Abyssinia. The expedition was efficiently conducted,
gained the release of the prisoners, and overcame the fortress of
Magdala in April, 1868. King Theodore shot himself during the attack on
the Fortress. British troops left the country in May, 1868.

5.
General Sir Robert Cornelis Napier (1810-1890), Commander-in-Chief of
the army of Bombay, when he was called to lead the Abyssinian
expedition. In recognition of his success he was made Baron Napier of
Magdala, and later became Field Marshal.

6.
C. R. Markham, geographer to the expedition, in chap. iv of his series
“The Abyssinian Expedition,” Macmillan’s, XVIII (Aug., 1868), pp.
289-96, offered the explanation that Napier had obtained the assistance
of the Abyssinian chiefs and people on the understanding that Theodore
would have to be destroyed.

124 to 123. For the debate, see Hansard, CXCII, cols. 1352-78. However,
the bill was subsequently withdrawn without debate on July 24, 1868.

Henry Jones, identified only as a graduate of the University of London
who was then a teacher in a private school in Bristol. Feeling cramped
in that situation because of the loss of his religious faith, he sought
JSM’s help in securing other work. As a student of JSM’s writings, he
also raised some questions with regard to a passage in Utilitarianism.

2.
Presumably in Part I, “The Unknowable,” First Principles (1862).

3.
Jones had quoted from p. 53 of the 3rd ed. as follows: “No reason can be
given why the general happiness is desirable except that each person . .
. desires his own happiness. This, however, being a fact, we have . . .
all the proof which the case admits of . . . that each person’s
happiness is a good to that person, and the general happiness,
therefore, a good to the aggregate of all persons.” (Collected Works, X,

Contemporary developments permitted this optimistic view of the decline
of protectionism; France and Germany lowered tariffs between 1860 and
1880, and the United States reduced tariffs for a period in the 1870’s.
By the end of the century, however, protection was dominant in all three

Letter 1282.

1.
MS and MS copy at UCL. In reply to De Morgan’s of Sept. 3, 1868,
published in Sophia De Morgan, Memoir, pp. 378-81. The appended note on
Virtus Dormitiva (MS not located, published in De Morgan Memoir, pp.
381-82) probably accompanied this letter since it also deals with some
of the matters raised by De Morgan’s letter of Sept. 3, which sought to
supply some corrections to JSM’s Logic, especially in Book I, chap. iii,
sec. 9 (6th ed.).

2.
JSM in the Logic had attributed the phrase to Bacon. De Morgan pointed
out that Ludovicus Vives (Spanish humanist and philosopher, 1492-1540)
“commends Petrus Hispanus [(d. 1321), Portuguese ecclesiastic and
philosopher, author of Summulae Logicales—for centuries a standard work
on elementary logic] for making it his definition, and corrects those
who think it only an hyperbole of praise, explaining it as the art which
treats of arts.”

3.
De Morgan had written: “In p. 71 [Logic, Book I, chap. iii, sec. 9 (6th
ed.)] you say that a pedantic physician in Molière accounts for the fact
that ‘l’opium endormit’ by the maxim ‘parcequ’il a un vertu
soporifique.’ From whom do you get your quotation marks? Not from
Molière. You know the original at the end of the Malade Imaginaire:—

-   

    Mihi a docto doctore.
-   

    Domandatur causam et rationem quare
-   

    Opium facit dormire.
-   

    A quoi respondeo
-   

    Quia est in eo
-   

    Virtus dormitiva,
-   

    Cuius est natura
-   

    Sensus assoupire.

“I never read this exquisite satire without wishing for a Molière to
expose the school of thinkers of our day who invert the process; and
having settled that opium has not and cannot have a virtus dormitiva,
will deny the sleep, or else declare that it is only a coincidence . .
.” (pp. 378-79). JSM adopted the version quoted by De Morgan in the 7th
ed. (1868); see 8th ed., II, 403.

4.
De Morgan: “I cannot understand how you liken the virtus dormitiva to a
case of the ‘scholastic doctrine of occult causes.’ In fact, I have
never been able to arrive at such causes in the Schoolmen. I know that
these offenders are charged in our day, and since the time of Bacon,
with upholding certain things called occult causes, but I cannot find
any. Virtutes occultae and occult qualities I find enough of” (p. 379).

5.
De Morgan: “You say elsewhere [Logic, Book II, chap. vii, “Examinations
of some opinions opposed to the preceding Doctrines,” I, 310, 6th ed.]
that the following proposition is not intelligible: ‘Abracadabra is a
second intention.’ Literally, ‘animal is a second intention’ may be held
false, not unintelligible. For a second intention is a subjective use of
a name. Probably you mean that the proposition ‘Abracadabra is a (name
of) second intention’ is unintelligible. But why more than ‘animal’? If
you mean that Abracadabra is a mere sound, you do less than due honour
to the name of a medical instrument of 1,200 years’ life. . . .” JSM did
not change this.

3.
At the heavily attended meeting of the electors of Greenwich on Sept.
16, Dickson read the letter from JSM; as reported by the Daily News,
Sept. 17, 1868, p. 3, JSM regarded it as “a great compliment for any
statesman to be elected by the spontaneous free will of a large
constituency; and he was sorry that the example had been dying out. It
had been carried out with respect to Mr. Cobden and Lord Brougham, and
it was an honour to the people of Greenwich that they intended to revive
this example by the election of such a politician as Mr. Gladstone for
Greenwich.”

4.
Norton in his letter had remarked that “the breaking up of old beliefs
and superstitions & institutions [in England] are much more obvious than
those of the future reorganization. But the question which seems to me
to underlie all others . . . is whether there is in England today a real
nation—a community—or simply a congeries of individuals divided into
distinct & almost hostile classes. I fear that a vast mass of the
population have no reason for attachment to the existing social order,
and no fear of change however subversive. . . . ”

alteration in substance (see n. 7 below), in Nation, VII (Oct. 15,
1868), 308-309. See also preceding Letter.

2.
In their 1868 party platform, the Democrats proposed that all government
bonds the payment of which was not restricted to coins should be payable
in lawful currency (i.e. in paper currency) and that the interest on
government bonds should be subject to income tax. See James Ford Rhodes,
History of the United States (8 vols., New York, 1892-1919), VI, 159-65.

3.
JSM and the Austins had all lost money when state bonds in the United
States were repudiated. See Earlier Letters, p. 486, n. 2.

4.
That is, bonds which were redeemable in five years, payable in twenty.
Much of the debt for the Civil War was in such bonds, which carried an
interest rate of six per cent, payable in gold coin.

5.
During the Civil War, Congress in 1862 had authorized the issuance of a
new type of public money, “United States notes,” popularly known as
“greenbacks.” They were not supported by any collateral, but simply by
the credit of the Federal government, and their value fluctuated.

6.
Thaddeus Stevens (1792-1868), lawyer, politician, powerful member of
Congress from Pennsylvania, 1848-53, 1858-68; advocate of a Draconian
policy towards the South.

7.
For the following three of JSM’s sentences, Norton, for the Nation,
substituted: “But if exemption from all direct taxation were a condition
of the contract, and expressly stipulated for, it is not an unjust
advantage conceded to the bondholders over other people, since for every
advantage so obtained value has been given by those who enjoy it in the
shape of a diminished interest.”

Punishment. Being a Reply to the Speech of John Stuart Mill . . . of

3.
Up to this time Bradlaugh had not actually been imprisoned though he had
been widely vilified and attacked. In May, 1868, the government had
sought to prosecute him as publisher of the National Reformerfor
violation of an 1819 law designed to suppress cheap democratic and
free-thought literature. JSM on May 25, 1868, presented to the Commons
Bradlaugh’s own petition for the repeal of the law, and on June 12 spoke
in support of repeal. The case against Bradlaugh was dropped on June 13
but revived the following year. See Letter 1434.

1.
MS and MS copy at UCL. In reply to De Morgan’s of Sept. 20, 1868 (MS not
located), published in De Morgan Memoir, pp. 382-84.

Noting JSM’s presence at Avignon, De Morgan had inquired whether any
information was available about three priests who had published there in
1770 a reprint of William Gardiner’s Tables of Logarithms, for all
numbers, from 1 to 102,100, first published in London in 1742.

2.
Le Père Jean Baptiste Blanchard, S.J. (1720-1788), professor of
philosophy at Aix, 1750-51; professor of mathematics at Toulon until the
suppression of the Jesuit order in 1773.

3.
Le Père Jean Dumas, S.J. (1696-1770).

4.
Esprit de Pézenas, S.J. (1692-1776), professor of hydrography at
Marseilles; erected the observatory at Avignon, of which he became the
director. He published the first translation of Gardiner in 1742, and
was a co-editor with Blanchard and Dumas of the Avignon edition of 1770.

5.
Not identified.

6.
JSM was apparently misinformed as to the name. The work referred to was
presumably Pézenas’s translation, Traité des fluxions, Par M. Colin
Maclaurin, Professeur de Mathématique dans l’Université d’Edimbourg
(Paris, 1749).

2.
Whether the people in any parish or township should have the right by a
two-thirds majority to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors. Asked,
Nov. 2, 1868, at an electioneering meeting of JSM and Robert Wellesley
Grosvenor, the liberal candidates for Westminster, JSM expressed
agreement with Grosvenor’s answer that 999 people could not have his
assistance in preventing one person from doing what he had a right to
do. See the Daily Telegraph, Nov. 3, 1868, p. 2.

3.
Permissive Prohibiting Liquor Bill, later introduced by Sir Wilfrid
Lawson (1829-1906), MP for Carlisle, on Feb. 22, 1869. Like a similar
bill, Intoxicating Liquors Bill, which Lawson had introduced March 10,
1864, the Permissive Bill would have granted owners and occupiers of
property within certain districts the local option of prohibiting the
sale of intoxicating liquors. The bill was introduced many times by
Lawson and as often defeated.

Emily Shirreff (1814-1897), educator, author, one of the sponsors of the
founding of Girton College (1869) for women. As a close friend of H. T.
Buckle since 1854, she had been asked by JSM and Helen Taylor to
contribute a biography of Buckle to the projected edition of his
literary remains. In 1869 Miss Shirreff, largely because her research
had revealed immoral behaviour by Buckle, asked to be relieved of the
task, though she eventually did contribute a biographical sketch. For an

“The Bouverie-Mill Controversy from a French Point of View,” Kilmarnock
Advertiser, Nov. 14, 1868.

The article opened with a tribute to JSM: “If there is one man in
England today who is entitled to the respect even of his most declared
enemies, it is certainly Mr John Stuart Mill. What a multitude of
reasons has England to be proud of him! She does not possess a greater
philosopher, economist, and moralist; or any man in whom the courage of
the citizen is united in a higher degree to the calmness of the thinker.
Nor can she offer to the world the example of a more thoroughly honest
man. Such, however, is the blind rage of party spirit that Mr John
Stuart Mill is at this moment the object of all sorts of venomous
attacks and of cruel and indecent raillery; and that to such an extent
that, stranger as I am in England, I blush for her. And what crime has
brought upon him this storm of reproaches? Mr Mill, convinced that
nobody would be better able than Mr Chadwick to plead with strength and
elevation in Parliament, the cause of the people, has written to the
electors of Kilmarnock and recommended them to elect him. Is not this a
very black crime?”

6.
Charles Wentworth Dilke (see Letter 1391). Dilke had been returned for
Chelsea by a margin of nearly two to one. JSM, at this time unacquainted
with Dilke, was probably unsure of his value as a “new man.”

7.
Gladstone had been elected for Greenwich, but was still a candidate for
re-election to his seat for Lancashire, Southwest. That election was not
to be held until Nov. 24. It was widely understood that if successful in
Lancashire, Gladstone would decline the Greenwich seat, thereby creating
a vacancy. In the event, Gladstone lost in Lancashire on Nov. 24 and
therefore accepted election for Greenwich.

Amberley in his letter of Nov. 18 had written: “I wish I had a seat for
a Liberal borough, & constituents willing to accept you as a member, as
I should have been proud to resign in your favour. Unfortunately the
Tories are very strong here, & if I can succeed in beating them at all
it will still be a very close contest. . . . Indeed it will be a
wonderful thing if a Liberal can be brought in at all for S. Devon, the
territorial influence being nearly all against us, & likely as you may
guess to be unsparingly used.”

W. H. Smith, JSM’s victorious opponent, continued to hold the seat for

Probably a reference to Morley’s prediction: “The election of 1868 at
this moment promises to be the most corrupt and dishonourable in our
annals, and to give us for rulers some of the richest and stupidest men
that ever entered the Chamber. The British Empire is going to be handed
over to the tender mercies of iron-masters, brewers, bankers, landlords,
and ship-owners.” (“The Political Prelude,” FR, n.s. IV [July 1, 1868],

Deploring the injustice of imposing taxation for national objects on

In 1866 and 1867 JSM had been an active member of a Select Committee
headed by A. S. Ayrton “to inquire into the Local Government and Local
Taxation of the Metropolis.” Though the Committee brought in reports and
proposals favouring municipal government, no progress was made. On May
5, 1868, JSM had introduced two bills, one providing for the
establishment of Municipal Corporations in the Metropolis, and the other
for the creation of a Corporation of London. He contended that with one
exception “the local government of the Metropolis was a parish
government,” and that government “by means of vestries had endured long
enough” (Hansard, CXCI, cols. 1859-63). Not until 1870, however, was
substantial progress achieved.

publishing firm of D. Appleton and Co., Youmans had been responsible for
the American publication of Spencer’s writings. In the fall of 1868
Youmans had travelled to England to secure contributions for a new
periodical he was to edit, Appleton’s Journal of Popular Literature,
Science and Art, which first appeared on April 3, 1869. In the first
volume Youmans published an abstract of the opening argument of JSM’s
Subjection of Women, June 19, 1869, pp. 372-74, and also an article,
“Mill on the Woman Question,” July 24, 1869, pp. 536-37.

3.
The proposed simultaneous publication arrangement by the Appleton firm
did not materialize. Appleton published an edition of the Pol. Econ. in
1870, based on the 5th (1862) English edition, and an edition of the
Subjection of Women in 1870, following one in 1869 by Lippincott of

Cairnes had written: “The Irish Church is indeed becoming a weariness
and heart sore, and it will be a mercy when it is dead and buried out of
sight.”

3.
Cairnes: “The rancour of the clergy and their adherents is only what one
might have expected, but I was when in Ireland a good deal surprised to
find great lukewarmness on the subject on the part of such priests as I
came in contact with. . . . The truth is I believe they all begin to
feel that they are parting with a valuable grievance which has not been
exploité yet to the extent of its capabilities; and I think something
like resentment is felt towards the liberals who have unexpectedly taken
them at their word.”

4.
Cairnes had noted that all the Irish Liberal candidates had “declared
for denominational education, or, what in their mouths means the same
thing, ‘freedom of education.’ The simple truth is that the priests make
this a test question; the masses are indifferent, and therefore obey the
priests. Nevertheless, I believe that sounder views are growing amongst
the educated Catholic laity; and I am in hopes that the settlement of
the Church question may do something to bring these better views into
prominence. For this reason as well as for that you mention [‘the
growing feeling against Denominationalism’ (Letter 1308)], everything is
to be gained by delay: in fact it constitutes our only hope of a sound
settlement.”

Malleson in a letter to The Times, Dec. 21, 1868, p. 5, on “The Defeat
of Mr. Mill,” commenting on the published letter to Esquiros, remarked
that JSM had omitted to mention one of the chief causes of his defeat,
“namely, the apparent incapacity, on the part of a large portion of the
constituency to admire or even to understand the rigid independence
which led him, on the eve of an important election, to act and write
precisely as he would have done had he not been a candidate. . . .

“No doubt, reckless expenditure of money on the other side, and the
perfect organization which unlimited means make possible, told against
us, but all this we were prepared for and meant to beat, as we had
beaten it before, by the strength of popular enthusiasm. Unfortunately,
the full wind upon which we had counted to fill our sails fell away
under the influence of the Bouverie correspondence and the Bradlaugh
subscription.”
