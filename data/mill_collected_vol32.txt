COLLECTED WORKS OF JOHN STUART MILL

volume xxxii

Edition: current; Page: [iii]
The Collected Edition of the Works of John Stuart Mill has been planned
and is being directed by an editorial committee appointed from the
Faculty of Arts and Science of the University of Toronto, and from the
University of Toronto Press. The primary aim of the edition is to
present fully collated texts of those works which exist in a number of
versions, both printed and manuscript, and to provide accurate texts of
works previously unpublished or which have become relatively
inaccessible.

Introduction

MARION FILIPIUK

editors, both past and present, of Mill’s correspondence have had to
live with the certain knowledge that the task would remain incomplete.
To the second volume of Earlier Letters, Professor Francis E. Mineka had
to append three “Additional Letters” that had come to light after the
volumes were in page proof.1 At the conclusion of the fourth volume of
Later Letters, he added another, much larger collection of recently
discovered letters, one of which had, again, arrived too late to take
its proper chronological place, even in the late additions.2 We have
been somewhat more fortunate with timing, in being able to add to this
collection at the very last moment a newly arrived series of letters to
M.E. Grant Duff. The ever impending problem of new acquisitions bears
evidence to the continued flourishing state of Mill studies, and we
cannot pretend to undue concern.

Even before the manuscript of Volumes XIV-XVII was submitted to the
publisher, a misplaced fragment of a letter was sent to John M. Robson,
appropriately by Professor F.A. Hayek, the originator of the project to
collect and publish Mill’s correspondence. The fragment appeared first
in the Mill News Letter,3 and was added in its proper place in Volume
XIV. Six letters from Mill to Sir William Molesworth also made their
first appearance in the News Letter,4 and then were subsequently
included in the Appendix to Later Letters.

Since 1972 thirty-seven more letters have been edited for publication in
the News Letter by friends of Mill and members of the Mill Project, and
seven others have been published in the Mill Society Bulletin, Japan. As
we continued to become aware of the existence of yet other letters, and
were fairly certain that in the intervening years new material would
have found its way into manuscript Edition: current; Page: [viii]
collections, we became convinced that we should initiate a new search
and gather in all known correspondence as part of the Collected Works.

Beginning in 1985, major public and university libraries and archives in
the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, historical
associations, relevant special collections, and selected libraries in
Europe, Australia, and New Zealand were contacted about recent
acquisitions or holdings possibly overlooked, with some pleasantly
surprising results. We were informed of three Mill letters in an
important collection of manuscripts recently left to the Pierpont Morgan
Library in New York by Gordon N. Ray; and a set of eight letters
exchanged between Mill and James Fitzjames Stephen was drawn to our
attention by the Librarian at Cambridge University. In the course of
locating the various drafts of Mill’s despatches in the India Office
Library and Records for the publication of a finding list in Volume XXX
of the Collected Works, Martin and Zawahir Moir found more than seventy
letters and notes from Mill to his colleagues in the East India Company.
Professor Shohken Mawatari undertook the task of checking the manuscript
holdings in Japan, with resulting additions to this collection, and
Professor Shigekazu Yamashita sent us copies of the letters to Theodor
Gomperz, earlier believed lost, but now held at Kokugakuin University.
Individual collectors, such as Professor Arnold Heertje, have also been
extremely helpful and generous.

From the files of Professor Mineka (which included those of Professor
Hayek), graciously passed on to us in 1985, emerged other clues to
previously unpublished material, such as entries from dealers’
catalogues. Though most of these letters could no longer be traced,
three have subsequently been located, in the Pierpont Morgan (Ray)
collection and in Japan; some, no doubt, remain in private hands. In the
files was also a series of typescripts of letters from Mill to Henry
Cole made by Professor James McCrimmon from manuscripts in his
possession in the early 1940s. Some, but not all, of these were printed
in Volumes XII-XIII; the rest appear here for the first time. We believe
that the McCrimmon manuscripts, apparently sent off for inclusion in the
Mill-Taylor Collection at the London School of Economics, were probably
victims of enemy action while in transit during the Second World War. A
letter to Professor Mineka, indicating the existence of a manuscript
fragment at Manchester College, Oxford, enabled us to obtain the first
part of Letter 1474A, to Mary Carpenter; and, much to our surprise, the
remaining fragment appeared in the collection of the College of Law,
Nihon University, Tokyo.

In all, well over 300 letters have come to light over the past eighteen
years, and now take their place in the Collected Works. The distribution
by decade is generally similar to that in the previous volumes. Three
have been added to the relatively meagre number that hitherto
represented the correspondence of the 1820s, and forty-three to each of
the decades of the 1830s and 1840s. There are fifty-eight new letters
written in the 1850s, of which forty-four derive from the Edition:
current; Page: [ix] India Office Records. By far the greatest number,
however, 129, belong to the decade of the 1860s, when Mill achieved the
height of his fame; and thirty-three, in a roughly similar proportion,
represent the first two-and-a-half years of the 1870s. They add
appreciably to our knowledge of almost every stage of Mill’s life.

Particularly significant is the long letter to George and Harriet Grote
(8.1), which describes many of the activities of Mill’s circle in
1824-25, and three early letters to John Bowring (8.2, 8.3, and 31.1)
that suggest the relations between him and the Mills may not have been
quite so strained as has previously been believed. A letter of
condolence to J.B. Say, on the death of Mme Say (29.1), reveals the deep
respect and gratitude that Mill entertained for Say and his family, as
well as the depth of his feelings on the suicide of his great friend
Eyton Tooke. A response to questions by J.A. Blanqui (85.1), Say’s pupil
and successor, about the teaching and propagation of political economy
in England in 1833, illustrates Mill’s boundless good will and effort in
accommodating and assisting French acquaintances. A letter to the Paris
bookseller Paulin (177.01) also, however, demonstrates his signal lack
of success in making the London and Westminster Review a real vehicle
for the international exchange of ideas.

The series of letters to Henry Cole, which is discussed in a separate
section below, has greatly enriched the detail of the circumstances
surrounding the transfer of the Review to him and William Hickson in
1840. Two other letters of that year (284.1 and 285.1) to John Calvert,
from a Mill deeply grieved by his younger brother’s death, show that
relations with Calvert, John Sterling’s great friend, on whom Mill
relied during Henry’s last days at Falmouth, were close. The second also
throws light on the way in which discussions at the Sterling Club helped
Mill to understand the Christian commitment of the Wilberforces, and it
dates his earliest steps to revise his essays for publication, a plan
not completed until the appearance in 1859 of Dissertations and
Discussions. The correspondence with Theodor Gomperz, discussed in
detail below, which began in the 1850s, illustrates another of Mill’s
warm, personal relations, in this case with a younger disciple who was
much in need of the generosity of spirit that was shown him. A separate
section is also devoted to consideration of the recently discovered
internal memos from the archives of the East India Company, which add to
our understanding both of the workings of the Company and of Mill’s work
as its employee.

Many previously unknown and interesting contacts during the decade of
the 1860s came to light in the course of our search, some producing
challenging questions. The second of three letters (594A, 617A, 1547A)
to J.E. Thorold Rogers, Drummond Professor of Political Economy at
Oxford, expresses Mill’s relief at escaping “the crowd and turmoil of
the present occasion,” in mid-June 1863, and adds, “I should be a little
ashamed, too, as well as surprised, at being thought sufficiently
orthodox when Kingsley is not.” No evidence has been found that Mill
was, like Kingsley, nominated for the degree of Doctor of Common
Edition: current; Page: [x] Laws, but at that time Kingsley withdrew his
name from the lists of candidates because of objections to his views. A
letter to the botanist John Lindley, editor of the Gardeners’ Chronicle
(671B), demonstrates both Mill’s active concern for conservation and his
intolerance of the “selfish rapacity” of those who would collect rare
plants. Three letters to James Fitzjames Stephen (690A, 833A, 1431A)
illustrate the course of their relationship between 1864 and 1869.5 Two
letters to the philosopher Henry Sidgwick in the fall of 1867 (1127A,
1160A) are, like two of those to Stephen, answers to requests for
advice, and demonstrate the same tact and wisdom in response to
difficult questions. Five to J.M.F. Ludlow (1046A, 1046B, 1112A, 1118A,
1521B) deal with more practical matters, the administrative reforms with
which Mill was concerned; they reveal that in 1867 Ludlow was very
active in assisting Benjamin Scott in preparing his evidence for the
Select Committee on Metropolitan Government (on which Mill served), and
that Ludlow had assisted James Beal in preparing his bills on the same
subject.6 One letter is Ludlow’s reward for services rendered: a warm
endorsement by Mill of his candidacy for the office of Registrar of
Friendly Societies, along with a keen and humorous assessment of the
politician Robert Lowe. There are three letters supportive, in
principle, of William Rossiter’s efforts in 1867 and 1868 to launch and
develop the South London Working Men’s College and its accompanying
school (1152B, 1239A, 1246A), and one to Elizabeth Malleson (999A)
applauding her similar endeavours for a Working Women’s College.

An excerpt from a letter written to the General Council of the
International Working Men’s Association in July 1870 (1583A) confirms
that Mill had indeed some knowledge of Marx, or, specifically, of his
speech on the Franco-Prussian war, which may have been sent to him for
comment and which he found admirable. Other new contacts in the few
years of the 1870s that remained to him continue to illustrate the
constant demands made upon his time for a variety of causes. A group of
letters that are held at the Palais du Roure in Avignon may also
illustrate something about the way Mill’s correspondence was bundled up,
when, more than thirty years after his death, books and papers were
disposed of at the local Librairie Roumanille. There are fourteen
letters to Mill, with seven draft replies written verso and two drafts
on separate sheets, most dating from the short period of August to
October, 1871; the remaining pieces are a certificate dated 1858,
unanswered letters of 1861, 1864, and 1865, and an envelope from 1888.7
Edition: current; Page: [xi] In all there are twenty items, probably
representing a single lot at the sale in May, 1905.

The editorial method followed here is virtually the same as that used in
the six previous volumes of correspondence. When the autograph letter
has not been available, the draft has been used and is so identified. We
have reproduced our sources as closely as possible, retaining vagaries
of spelling in both English and French without comment. We have,
however, transferred dates and addresses that appeared at the end of a
letter to the beginning, and occasionally have silently added an
end-of-line comma or full stop. The first footnote to each letter
provides the location of the manuscript; addresses and postmarks where
available; publication information for letters previously printed;
information about conjectural dating; and, at first references,
identification of the recipient. When possible, letters have been
related to those sent to Mill.

The practice in the Appendices of Collected Works, Volume XVII, has been
followed for the enumeration of the letters. For additional Earlier
Letters, a decimal notation has been used: e.g., Letter 284. 1 below, of
25 Apr., 1840, is next in chronological sequence after 284, of 22 Apr.,
1840, in Volume XIII, pp. 429-30. An alphabetical indicator signals
additions to Later Letters: e.g., Letter 336A below, of 29 Nov., 1858,
follows 336, of 28 Nov., 1858, in Volume XV, p. 578. In eight cases,
when the letter antedated one already inserted in the sequence, we were
forced to resort to a further refinement; see, e.g., 171.01 and 862AA
below. Letters already in Collected Works in incomplete form, reprinted
here in full, retain their original numbers. Of fifty-two undated
letters discovered, we have managed to assign dates to all but fifteen;
these last have been arranged chronologically, as far as could be
determined, in a separate section, and bear the prefix “No.” In
footnotes, letters in this volume will generally be referred to by
number, letters in Earlier and Later Letters, by volume and page.8

LETTERS TO HENRY COLE

several of the new letters to Henry Cole and one to John Mitchell Kemble
throw more light on the story of Mill’s divesting himself of the London
and Westminster Review and transferring it in the spring of 1840 to Cole
and William Edward Hickson.9 Mill’s determination to withdraw from the
costly proprietorship and onerous editorship was evident in October
1839, when he tried to interest Thomas Wentworth Beaumont, the wealthy
proprietor of the British and Foreign Review, in taking it on. His first
tentative approach (265.1 below) was through Kemble, the editor, with
whom he had only “a former slight acquaintance,” but through whom he
thought it prudent to make the preliminary enquiry. Since the two
reviews had had the “same difficulties to struggle against,” and
basically the same readership to draw upon, Mill thought there might be
some pecuniary advantage to Beaumont in incorporating the rival radical
organ. Kemble’s reply apparently indicated several issues on which the
opinions of the two reviews had been at variance, and clearly suggested
that he was unfavourably disposed to the merger; but he offered to write
to Beaumont.10 Mill was left dangling for months, expecting some sort of
response from Beaumont, and apparently unwilling to let the silence
speak for itself.

As early as August 1839, Mill began to confide his problems with the
Review (and with John Robertson, who had been mismanaging it in his
absence on the Continent) to Cole, who was obviously interested in
becoming involved, but said nothing at that point.11 He knew about
Mill’s offering it to Beaumont, since they discussed the matter during
walks to town in October. There is no hard evidence in Cole’s diary that
he was pressing his suit, though VanArsdel interprets the fact that all
contact with Mill ceased during Cole’s illness, 7 November to 14
January, as an indication that he was perhaps putting too much pressure
on Mill.12

Robertson apparently called on Cole on the first day of that illness to
talk about the “future management of the review.” A previously
unpublished letter from Mill Edition: current; Page: [xiii] to Cole
(268.1) may be dated to 12 November, the Tuesday following that meeting.
Robertson must have explained some sort of “plan” that he and Cole had
formulated, which possibly involved their sharing of the editorial
duties in future. The letter also suggests that they were hoping Mill
might be persuaded to retain the proprietorship if he were relieved of
the editorial burden. Robertson appears not to have felt that his
position was threatened by the proposed arrangement, as Mill says, “He
seemed to me to be neither for nor against the plan, but to await my
decision. Now my decision, if I consider myself only, will be, whatever
becomes of the review, to withdraw myself from it.” Beaumont is still
his major hope; he thinks, after waiting nearly a month, that he “cannot
be much longer without” an answer. If Beaumont fails, Mill says: “I
should like best . . . that your schemes should proceed, with some other
person than myself as the proprietor.”

There is no mention of Hickson in this letter, and no indication that
the discussion went any further at this point. Mill may have decided
that he prefered to shelve their plans until he knew definitely where
Beaumont stood. Cole, however, was not totally idle. The diary for 17
November notes that Hickson called and “promised to help in some new
arrangements of the L. and W.R.” This is the first entry that
specifically links Hickson with the plans, though contacts between Cole
and Hickson were frequent during this period.13

Mill continued to wait throughout December and January, and the only
relevant item in Cole’s diary is the unspecific comment that on 7
January, 1840 he had a chat with William Makepeace Thackeray about the
Review. It is likely that no one wanted to push Mill, since all were
aware that he had serious concerns and financial responsibilities
resulting from the declining health of his brother Henry. And it is
likely that Mill’s procrastination and wavering were at least partly the
result of his disturbed state of mind and the uncertainty about his
brother’s fate.14

On 6 February, in the midst of this turmoil, and presumably feeling the
pressure of shortly having to produce the March number, Mill suddenly
offered the Review to Cole, still “in case of Beaumont’s refusal to buy
it,” and then, just as suddenly, the next day withdrew the offer.
Letters 273 and 276, the dates of which were uncertain, can now be
assigned through Cole’s diary to 6 and 8 February: Cole and his brother
called on Mill on the 9th to try to straighten things out. “One or two
Edition: current; Page: [xiv] friends” had, in the interval, been trying
to persuade Mill that he should not allow the Review to continue with
the name unchanged, as he would remain closely associated in people’s
minds with it, and that it would be more to his credit “that it should
cease entirely than that it should be continued as anything else than
the philosophical & political organ it was designed to be.” Perhaps Mill
felt guilty and embarrassed about having treated Cole badly, because,
after a breathing space, contact, if not negotiations, resumed by 15
February.15

At the “eleventh hour,” on a Thursday, probably 27 rather than 20
February, Mill wrote to Cole, again offering him the Review if he would
carry it on under the name of Westminster, and adding that he would be
even happier to turn it over to him and Hickson jointly, as Cole
proposed, but all this still subject to a last-minute offer from
Beaumont, “or from some other quarter almost as improbable.”16 Letter
277.1, here published for the first time, is obviously a second note
written at “20 minutes before 6,” on the same day, just as Mill was
rushing off to Reynell’s to oversee the printing of the March number of
the Review.17 It was prompted, obviously, by the fact that he had indeed
had the offer from the “other quarter [he] alluded to,” and he would
suddenly like the matter decided, with “an announcement in the present
number,” but was still somewhat short of certain: “if you are willing to
carry it on our agreement must be conditional on the very probable event
of my refusing [the other offer].”

No such announcement appeared in the March number, though, curiously,
discussion seems to have heated up among all parties almost at once. It
is scarcely surprising that final arrangements failed to be made on such
short notice, and other moves were apparently afoot. Cole had noted in
his diary on 20 February (a Thursday) that Robertson had called on him;
there is no specific mention of the Review at all, but on the following
Friday, the 28th, Cole and Robertson dined together, and then with Mill
and George Fletcher (an occasional contributor to the Westminster)
walked to Kensington. How can all this be squared with Mill’s making an
offer to Cole on the 27th, which Cole not only failed to take up at
once, but failed to mention in his diary?

It is possible that by 20 February Robertson could see that Mill was
wanting to put the matter to rest soon, and that his job as editor was
in jeopardy; so a reminder to Cole of his interest in staying on, and
his difficulties, may have appeared timely. Cole’s lack of response to
Mill’s offer may have resulted from “the force of circumstances”—an
inability to reach Hickson, vagueness in their arrangements (as
everything still seemed to hinge on Beaumont), or his own financial
uncertainty. Whatever the reasons, or the sequence of events, it is
certain that after the conversations on the 28th, Robertson was aware
that the tide had definitely set Edition: current; Page: [xv] against
him and that he immediately mounted a campaign to save his position. It
sounds, indeed, as if Robertson had made a bid to conduct the Review as
sole editor. Cole’s diary for the 29th reports:

Walked to town with John Mill who seemed to think that Robertson could
not manage the Review by himself. . . . Robertson called and in a round
about manner urged all sorts of reasons to influence his remaining
Editor of the Review. He said he did not like J. Mill’s conduct and that
he had offers to write in the Edinburgh, that without him and J. Mill
the character of the Review would be gone, that in fact the Review owed
him £900, that he had never been able to have his own way, etc. etc.18

It seems likely that Robertson had had a rude shock on the 28th when he
discovered that Cole and Hickson were potential co-proprietors and his
editorship was in question. Cole was apparently sympathetic to his
problems, and Robertson persevered. On 5 March he returned to visit
Cole, and made a new proposal—that Cole “be sole proprietor and he
editor of the Review.” Mill must have heard about this scheme from
Robertson later on the same day and hoped to talk to Cole about it the
next morning, but missed him. This inference dates Mill’s letter of
Friday to 6 March.19

It is here that an undated letter of Cole’s must fit, in response to
Mill’s early morning note.20 It is also headed “Friday.” Cole had talked
to Hickson on Thursday night; Hickson was unwilling to enter into a
joint proprietorship with Robertson as editor. In the letter Mill is
asked to decide between Cole and Hickson, or Cole and Robertson: “the
decision must rest with you.” Later that day, Mill replies: “The
responsibility thus devolving wholly on me I must take till Monday to
consider. But I will be prepared to give you an answer positively on
that day.” (277.2.)

Cole, however, did not wait for Mill’s answer—or he knew what it would
be. His diary for 6 March notes: “Wrote to John Mill abt. Robertson’s
editorship. . . . In the evening writing to Robertson to decline his
proposition.” On Saturday, the 7th, Hickson made Cole a generous offer
to take a greater number of the shares, thereby lessening Cole’s
financial responsibility in the venture.21

VanArsdel’s dating of Mill’s letter of partial explanation to Robertson
to 10 or 11 March seems correct.22 Mill undoubtedly would have written
before the formal transfer took place, as it did on Thursday, the
12th.23 Letter 279, in reply to Robertson’s answer of complaint, may
thus be dated to Monday, 16 March.24

Edition: current; Page: [xvi]
Mill obviously agreed to help Cole and Hickson with the editing if they
so wished, and the brief letter to Cole (287.1) can probably be dated
“before 26 May,” the date of publication of the June issue. “The
Critical and Miscellaneous Notices” section became a feature of the
Review under the new owners, mentioned as such in the notice of change.
Though Mill clearly thought it was a poor substitute for solid articles,
he went over the notices for the June number, as requested, and
contributed three to the September number. This letter must have
reference to the June and not the September number, because Cole
withdrew in July and was no longer in charge of the section.25

The evidence from the three new letters to Cole printed below, Cole’s
diary, Caroline Fox’s diary, and VanArsdel’s article permits a redating
and reordering of the letters from this period as listed below. (Those
preceded by No. are found in Collected Works, Volume XIII.)26

LETTERS TO THEODOR GOMPERZ

the relationship between Mill and his young Austrian disciple Theodor
Gomperz was similar to that with the even younger Englishman, John
Morley. With these two men, Mill’s role was that of father figure as
well as mentor, and his genuine interest in, and abundant kindness to,
the rising generation of the talented and reform-minded is much in
evidence in his dealings with them. But Gomperz’s special problems
brought out the depth of Mill’s generosity of spirit for a troubled mind
in a way that no other relationship called for. Mill was, in many ways,
at his absolute best with Gomperz, in the honesty that accompanied the
compassion and the modest reticence that avoided applying pressure to an
overburdened spirit. Yet in the circumstances that accompanied Gomperz’s
aspirations to Helen Taylor’s hand, Mill also demonstrated the naïveté
bordering on blindness that was characteristic of his attitudes where
his wife and her daughter were concerned. Gomperz treasured Mill’s
letters to him over the years, and they were used by his Edition:
current; Page: [xvii] son Heinrich in a study of his father’s life,
based on his correspondence.27 It was from this source and from drafts
in the Johns Hopkins and Mill-Taylor collections that most of these
letters came into Later Letters.

In a communication to the editor of the New York Times of 25 April,
1939, Heinrich Gomperz claimed to have “published all of these letters
in their full English text,” and then, having

put [them] to all the use they were capable of yielding, . . . sold the
originals at a very modest price to a second-hand bookseller in London
from whom they were purchased by Lord Stamp, who, not knowing that they
had already been published, . . . wrote a lengthy article about them
and, indeed, republished them in part in The Times of London on Dec 29,
1938.

Stamp’s selection in fact revealed that Gomperz had not published quite
all of the letters, or “their . . . full text,” as, for example, a
two-sentence fragment of Letter 292 and an additional paragraph of
Letter 324 below, which Stamp included, bore witness. It was
subsequently assumed that the letters were destroyed in 1941, when Lord
Stamp died in an air raid that demolished his home.28 We now know that
such was not the case. The collection appeared on the market in 1986
and, through the Tokyo dealers, Maruzen, was purchased by Kokugakuin
University. It includes thirty-nine letters to Gomperz, a questionnaire
relating to the Logic, and a letter to Gomperz’s sister Josephine von
Wertheimstein. Owing to the good offices of Professor Shigekazu
Yamashita, we were able to obtain copies for collation with the versions
which had already appeared in Later Letters.29

Eight letters in the collection, and the questionnaire, are previously
unpublished. Four have additional paragraphs, and other differences
range from as many as three-and-a-half missing sentences to a short
phrase or two. We have decided to reprint those letters (including the
one to Gomperz’s sister) that differ by as much as, or more than, a
major clause from the version published in Later Letters, with
substantive variants noted at the foot of the page. Variants (excluding
consideration of salutations and complimentary closings) between the
manuscripts and the other letters in Collected Works, not reprinted
here, are listed in Appendix A below.

The friendship between Mill and Gomperz began when the latter wrote in
the summer of 1854 asking permission to translate and publish a German
edition of the Edition: current; Page: [xviii] Logic, a request which
Mill readily granted.30 Three previously unknown notes from Mill to
Gomperz (262A, 262B, and 262C, below), dated almost two years later in
the early fall of 1856, document the fact that Gomperz, when in England,
was provided with the latest edition of the Logic, the fourth, and
invited overnight to Blackheath to discuss the translation. It was the
only occasion on which Gomperz met Harriet, and she seems to have
approved of him, if one may judge from the personal revelation she made
to him.31 Her approval would surely help to account for Mill’s continued
loyalty to Gomperz, despite his inability, over a considerable period,
to arrange for publication of the translations of Mill’s works.

The friendship was thus firmly established in 1856, though there was at
once to be a year’s gap in their correspondence. Gomperz apparently next
wrote to Mill on 30 September, 1857, telling of the death of his father
earlier that year and asking a favour. Could Mill determine whether it
would be possible for a medical friend of his to obtain a post in the
service of the East India Company? Mill replied at once, on 5 October,
as helpfully as he was able, in Letter 292 below (most of which is
previously unpublished), and expressed an interest in learning more
about Gomperz’s own scholarly work. Yet another ten months passed before
Gomperz wrote again, apparently on 21 August, 1858, telling of his
publications in the Rheinisches Museum, and suggesting that he would
like to include in his translation of the Logic some of Mill’s
controversy with Whewell. Once again, Mill’s response (324 below) was
immediate, on 30 August, agreeing to all Gomperz’s suggestions, and in a
previously unpublished paragraph saying that he needed a long
“recruiting” from the “confinement of an office”; he had therefore seen
fit to refuse the post on the Council of India that had been offered to
him by Lord Stanley.

On 10 November, pleased to have at last, it seemed, found a publisher
for the Logic, Weber of Leipzig, who was planning to bring it out in
December and January, Gomperz replied.32 He enclosed a pamphlet, Die
Theorie der Induktion, by Professor Ernst Friedrich Apelt of the
University of Jena, and asked Mill if he would care to answer the
arguments and include his response in the translated volumes. He also
asked for permission to be the translator of On Liberty. This letter
arrived when Mill was crippled by grief at Harriet’s death, but he
dutifully Edition: current; Page: [xix] replied to Gomperz on 4
December,33 suggesting that perhaps Gomperz would make some comment on
the controversy himself and seeming not to have focused on the request
about On Liberty. In his lost letter of condolence of 10 December,
Gomperz apparently was enthusiastic in his praise of Harriet; Mill was
pleased that “so little as [he] saw of her, should have made so true an
impresson.” He acceded to Gomperz’s request about the translation of the
forthcoming work, promising to let him have “one of the earliest copies
or the sheets.”34

In January 1859, Gomperz apparently wrote again, asking another
favour—that a copy of On Liberty be sent to a friend. Mill made the
arrangements, and then, not having had any acknowledgment by 31 March,
wrote volunteering to send another copy if the first had gone astray. He
also made a discreet enquiry into Gomperz’s “various literary projects”
(381 below, previously unpublished). This letter went unanswered, and
Mill wrote yet again on 16 May (392 below). He asked this time not about
the book for the friend, but whether Gomperz had ever received the
sheets of On Liberty and whether he was still wanting to do the
translation, since he had had another offer from a Prussian magistrate,
Eduard John, who was interested in undertaking it and seemed like “a
competent person.” Mill in fact directly asked Gomperz (in a sentence
omitted by his son) whether he knew of John, and whether “in case the
undertaking should not suit [Gomperz],” he should “close with [John’s]
offer.” Mill was obviously anxious that On Liberty should make the
impact and gain the recognition that the memory of Harriet deserved.

This appeal brought a response from Gomperz in late May or early June,
in which he referred to “unhappy events which [had] caused [him] so much
pain and disturbance of mind.” Whatever the events, here was the first
evidence of the emotional problems that were to plague Gomperz for the
next several years and to impede progress both with his own scholarly
work and with his good intentions of making Mill’s writings known in
German-speaking Europe. In his reply of 11 June (398 below), Mill said
he was content to leave the translation of On Liberty with Gomperz as he
wished, and he tried to remove any semblance of pressure concerning it.
The relationship then lapsed into a period of silence for almost two
years.

Mill’s note of 18 April, 1861, and the follow-up of 3 July (487B and
494A below), were not published in Briefe, presumably because they
underlined Gomperz’s failure to fulfil his commitments. Unsure that the
first note would reach Gomperz, since his address had been mislaid, Mill
asked him to write and give it in full again so that a copy of
Representative Government could be properly sent; he also mentioned his
surprise at learning that a German translation of On Liberty had
appeared. By 3 July Mill had found the address, and wrote to say that a
copy of the Edition: current; Page: [xx] new work was on the way and
that he was “vexed” to learn of the German version by an unknown
translator (494A). Whether Gomperz received the first of these appeals
is not known, but the second at least evoked a response written on 1
August, which fortunately is still extant. Gomperz had evidently been in
the depths of a depression for some time. Though a considerable portion
of the translation of On Liberty had been finished and even “printed
long ago,” his lethargy and “apathy of mind” had prevented its
completion and publication. His embarrassment at his lack of performance
and his immense gratitude for Mill’s kindness in renewing their
friendship are touching, as is Mill’s response of 24 August.35 Mill was
fully able to sympathize with a “morbid affection” that sapped energy,
but expressed great confidence in Gomperz’s ability and encouraged him
to continue with his translation of On Liberty. He also assured Gomperz
that he did not “know anything more important or more intensely
interesting than the progress and chances of the political
transformation of Austria,” and that he agreed, “from beginning to end,”
in Gomperz’s analysis of the Hungarian question.

Yet another silence fell until Mill, showing great forethought, wrote
again, this time from Athens, on 12 June, 1862 (538B below, previously
unpublished), to say that he and Helen were planning to visit Vienna and
Budapest on their return home and would like to see Gomperz in Vienna,
or elsewhere in Austria, “during the month of August.” He asked that
Gomperz write to him, Poste Restante in Constantinople, where they hoped
to be “in a month from this time, perhaps sooner.” Heinrich Gomperz did
not publish this note, presumably because in his view it represented
merely a complication of arrangements; but Mill watchers are interested
in his deliberately planning to visit Gomperz (probably motivated in
part by the young man’s new political concerns and connections) and his
shortening his trip with Helen, reaching Constantinople by 24 June.36 It
is interesting too that they continued in the area until about 5 July,
without receiving any communication from Gomperz, as Mill’s note to him
of 17 July, announcing their early arrival in Vienna, suggests.37 This
note, which implies no failure on the part of Gomperz,38 Edition:
current; Page: [xxi] was published by his son Heinrich; it in fact
initiated a visit of several days, which was both a pleasant interlude
and a prelude to further problems.

On his return to Avignon from Bad Ischel, where he and Helen had left
Gomperz, Mill wrote on 17 September (554 below) to tell him of their
movements in Austria after they had parted, and their activities since,
in three-and-a-half sentences of interesting detail that his son chose
not to include. Heinrich also made another, apparently minor, omission
at the end, of two short sentences: “I have found Dr Schiel’s letter; it
is dated Frankfurt. Let me hear from you now and then.” The implications
in the comment about Schiel, however, are rich. In 1849 J. von Schiel
had published a translation of part of the Logic, as Die inductive
Logik, and in 1862-63 through the same publisher, Vieweg, a complete
translation of the work. Mill’s brief remark suggests that Schiel had
written to Gomperz to tell him that he was issuing this new edition, and
that he had also written to inform Mill. It suggests too that there had
probably been some discussion of the difficulties that Gomperz had had
in trying to find a publisher, and also of Gomperz’s position as the
authorized translator of Mill’s works; yet, again, the fact of a
previously issued translation did not negate Mill’s endorsement of
Gomperz’s efforts, though still unfulfilled.

Before Mill had posted this letter of 17 September, he had received a
letter from Gomperz (now lost) that expressed great anxiety at not
having heard about their safe return. Gomperz had apparently misread the
signals of friendship that he had been receiving during their time
together, and had begun to entertain romantic notions about a possibly
permanent relation with Helen and her father. Mill’s comment in his
postscript to the letter of 17 September—“I should have written before,
had I thought you would have felt any such anxiety as you mention on our
account”—appears unintentionally to have fed Gomperz’s hopes rather than
lessened them.

The effect of these aspirations, and no doubt also of the appearance of
Schiel’s edition of the Logic, seems to have been that Gomperz was
driven back to his own translation of that work, and to plans for a trip
to England. He wrote to Mill in late November or early December,39
setting out his hopes for a reunion in London in January and enclosing a
questionnaire about the Logic, the first question of which reflects his
persistent concern about his being the truly authorized translation,
carried out “with the collaboration of the author” (564 below). Gomperz
apparently reached London in mid-February, 1863, and Mill at once
hastened to provide the new arrival with a letter of introduction, dated
20 February, to the Greek historian George Grote (589A below, previously
unpublished). On that same day, Mill also took the trouble to write to
the editor of the Spectator (589B below, also previously unpublished) to
send him some information about the political situation in Austria that
Gomperz had enclosed in an earlier letter. One must conclude that Mill
hoped that the younger man would be pleasantly Edition: current; Page:
[xxii] surprised, and encouraged in his endeavours, by seeing that some
serious notice had been taken of his activities and his writings.

Mill clearly made an effort to repay the hospitality shown to him and
Helen in Austria the previous summer, unaware that his gestures of
friendship might well be misconstrued by a young man with marriage on
his mind. Gomperz was invited on two consecutive Sunday evenings to
dinner at Blackheath, where he met William Thornton and Thomas Hare.40
Mill also arranged for him to attend a meeting of the Political Economy
Club on 6 March,41 and the public meeting of the 26th in St. James’s
Hall, at which the trades unionists of London demonstrated their support
for the cause of the North in the American Civil War. Mill’s invitation
to that meeting (603A below), at which Gomperz was to meet Henry
Fawcett, is previously unpublished. The occasion for Gomperz was an
extremely impressive one, both historically, as it was the first time
that the working men’s societies had participated in public discussion
of a great public question of the day, and personally, as he accompanied
Helen, while Mill sat on the platform.42 Yet another token of Mill’s
friendship was the gift of a copy of Utilitarianism; and on Gomperz’s
immediate request, permission was once again granted to him to be the
authorized translator.43

Mill and Helen apparently never mentioned to Gomperz that they were
planning to leave for Avignon two days after the meeting in St. James’s
Hall.44 Gomperz’s letter to his sister Josephine of 29 March, describing
his reception at breakfast by the Grotes at their London home on that
day, suggests that he was quite unaware of the departure.45 By the time
he returned on 5 April from a weekend with the Grotes and their friends
at Barrow Green, however, he had heard the news, and, despite his recent
social success, he was plunged into despair, both because he had
obviously failed to convey his intentions about Helen and because he
felt abandoned.46 On 18 April Gomperz wrote to suggest that he join Mill
and Helen in Avignon, where he hoped to make his feelings clear.

Mill’s answer of the 23rd, dissuading him from the visit, poured cold
water on his hopes.47 He sent a tormented response, to which Mill
replied, on 9 May,48 honestly, yet somewhat tenatively, since Gomperz’s
letter referred to “suppositions,” apparently adverse to himself, which
Mill was deemed to have made. Gomperz then went off to Oxford, where he
did, in fact, make some progress with his plans to study and edit
tracings of manuscripts from Herculaneum, before experiencing a kind of
breakdown towards the end of the month. His strange behaviour caused his
new friends there to send for help from home, which arrived, apparently
in the first week of June, in the person of his friend Eduard Wessel,
but not before Gomperz had gone missing for a short time and caused some
alarm.49 According to Weinberg’s account, it was on Saturday, 6 June, as
this crisis was occurring, that Mill, back from Avignon, invited him to
dinner on the 7th to meet Alexander Bain.50 Gomperz of course did not
receive this invitation until he came back to London shortly thereafter
with Wessel.

The next note of invitation of 11 June (617 below) suggests that Mill,
receiving no reply, went to call on Gomperz; the two phrases omitted
from the letter as published by his son indicate that there was
apparently some intervening arrangement proposed for the 12th, a dinner
at Blackheath with Louis Blanc. When Blanc proved unavailable for that
date, Mill wrote to suggest that Gomperz and Wessel come on Sunday, the
14th. The restoration of what may seem trivial omissions shows clearly
that Mill was making an all-out effort to see the distressed young
man.51

Distressed he most assuredly was, however, though apparently under
control at the Sunday dinner party. On the following day, it seems that
he wrote to Mill, hinting again at his “wishes” with regard to Helen and
communicating his paranoid fears about having been “maligned” to them.
This time, Mill understood what he was aiming at, and in his reply of 16
June very kindly, but firmly, suggested that he had no chance with
Helen. Mill also, however, most wisely left a course of action open to
him: “If you think fit to carry the matter farther, either by speech or
writing—even if only for the relief of your own feelings—you will have
my truest sympathy, as you have my sincere friendship and esteem. . . .
I hope that nothing that has passed will make any difference in your
friendly feelings towards Edition: current; Page: [xxiv] us, who remain
unchanged to you. . . .” And Mill expressed hope that Gomperz and Wessel
would come (as had probably been arranged at the earlier meeting) on the
following day.52 Mill’s sympathy for such mental anguish was the product
of experience, and his everlasting tolerance of Gomperz’s inability to
bring out German editions of his works, as undertaken, was probably born
of the awareness that he had contributed, even if unknowingly—or perhaps
because unknowingly—to his suffering.

After Gomperz’s departure from London, which must have occurred very
shortly after their last visit, Mill wrote to him on 15 July a most kind
and friendly letter of encouragement,53 expressing confidence in his
great ability and in the therapeutic benefits of “real intellectual
work.” Gomperz apparently responded immediately, on the 18th, from the
depths of unhappiness and paranoia.54 Mill waited until the 29th to
reply, presumably because Gomperz had intimated that he would write
again immediately, but then failed to do so. Once more Mill’s wisdom in
dealing with emotional disturbance, and delusions, is greatly in
evidence. He forthrightly asks Gomperz to explain to him in exactly what
way he sees himself as misunderstood, so that the matter may be cleared
up, and he gently reiterates the gospel of work, in proper doses, as the
remedy for a great mind, greatly troubled. Nor did his active concern
cease at that point. When he received no response to this encouragement,
he replied on 25 August (639 below) to a letter from Gomperz’s sister,
apparently written earlier, on her brother’s return to Austria,
explaining the line of encouragement he had taken with him. In a
sentence omitted by Heinrich Gomperz, Mill suggests that Wessel had, in
the interim, sent him word of their friend’s condition,55 and Mill asked
that he continue to do so.

It appears that Gomperz made some response himself after this second,
indirect, effort, saying that he was somewhat better, and at work, but
he also responded to Mill’s attempt to let him clear the air. Mill’s
reply of 17 September (644 below) certainly suggests, however, that
Gomperz was still suffering from paranoid delusions, which Mill once
more dealt with directly; and once again he acceded to the request from
Gomperz to be recognized as the authorized translator of Utilitarianism,
enclosing a formal statement to that effect on a separate sheet.

At this point another silence fell, and it lasted until the summer of
the following year, when Mill again wrote, on 26 June, 1864 (700 below),
prompted, one might surmise from the introductory sentence (another
omission of Heinrich Gomperz’s), by a letter from Wessel that spoke of
Gomperz’s “intended publication” of Philodemus’s On Anger. Mill yet
again reaffirms his friendly feelings, as well as his genuine interest
in, and the inherent value of, Gomperz’s scholarly work. Gomperz
apparently at once had a copy of the volume sent to Mill, without any
Edition: current; Page: [xxv] personal communication; and Mill took the
opportunity of a favourable notice in the Saturday Review to acknowledge
and praise it, on 22 August.56

Gomperz’s next gesture was to send Mill the first number of his
Herculanean series, concerning Philodemus on induction, and Mill wrote
in reply the following spring, on 30 April, 1865 (806 below). It seems
that Gomperz had written to him “some months ago,” and had at the time
promised a longer letter, which had failed to materialize (a detail
Gomperz’s son excised). Mill had already sent Gomperz both the
Examination of Sir William Hamilton’s Philosophy, and the first part of
his study of Comte (neither of which had apparently been acknowledged),
and was planning to send shortly an advance copy of the second article
on Comte. It had been two years since there had been any discussion of
the projected translations of three of Mill’s works, but never a word of
question or hint of reproach had been whispered. Is such restraint
possible in ordinary human nature?

And so the pattern would continue on both sides, Gomperz sending Mill
yet another scholarly production, the second volume of the Herculanean
series, “dedicated [to him] with reverence and love, on the occasion of
his sixtieth birthday, May 20,” and Mill thanking him heartily, if a
trifle tardily, on 22 August, 1866, giving parliamentary business as his
excuse, and trying to elicit a response from the reticent disciple by
asking his opinion about the remarkable political changes in Germany.57
There is no evidence that his opinion was ever forthcoming; perhaps for
that reason Mill’s direct invitation to write to him in the final
paragraph did not find its way into Briefe. The silence descended again
until the beginning of 1868, at which time a flurry of activity about a
possible collected edition of Mill’s works in German began.

In January of that year, Mill received a letter from Julius Grosser,
proprietor of the Viennese firm of Tendler and Co., which was prepared
to undertake the project, and an accompanying note from Gomperz,58 full
of enthusiasm about this new undertaking. He naturally gave explanations
for previous non-performance, described in Mill’s reply of 28 January as
“causes of unhappiness . . . respecting which you hold out the hope that
I shall hear something from Mr Wessel”;59 and Mill apparently did
subsequently learn through him of the sudden death of Gomperz’s nephew,
Carl, and the resulting breakdown of his sister Josephine.60 Mill
probably follows Gomperz’s letter in discussing the works to be included
in the new edition. The Logic would occupy the first two volumes, and
Mill volunteered to send the alterations he was making at the time for
the seventh edition. He informed Gomperz that he had already given
permission to Dr. Anton Edition: current; Page: [xxvi] Dohrn of Jena to
translate the Inaugural Address, and suggested that Grosser get in touch
with Dohrn. Mill had also referred Wilhelm Sattler to Grosser about a
translation of the work on Comte. Gomperz had apparently asked Mill
whether he had seen F.A. Wille’s translation of Representative
Government (1862), and Mill replied that it seemed to him to need “a
good deal of correction.” Gomperz had also asked about the possible
inclusion of Essays on Unsettled Questions of Political Economy, and
Mill commented that he would wish to alter the first essay considerably
if they were to be reissued in English—not a very positive reply.
Gomperz was sure, however, that it would be wise to keep the Examination
back, at least at first.

Not having received any acknowledgment of the sheets of Book I of the
Logic, Mill wrote again on 18 March, 1868 (a letter not included in
Briefe), inquiring whether Gomperz had received them; he enclosed those
for the rest of the first volume, and promised to have the sheets of
volume two sent on to him “without any avoidable delay.”61 Gomperz
replied apologetically on 26 March,62 thanking Mill for the sheets of
the whole work, which had arrived, and raising various issues and
questions about the edition. The details are interesting, since they
show that Gomperz now certainly wanted to take full charge and ensure
that the translations would be of high quality. He recommended that Mill
accede to Eduard Wessel’s request, enclosed, to be the translator of
Dissertations and Discussions, and that Wessel also be allowed to
translate Representative Government again, as Wille’s version was so
poor. Sattler’s translation of Auguste Comte and Positivism would be
carefully scrutinized by Gomperz, who would not hesitate to correct “any
material errors.” (In the event it satisfied him so ill that another
translation was undertaken later by Gomperz’s wife, Elise.) Anton Dohrn
had reported that he would have to give his translation of the Inaugural
Address a thorough revision, but since he had no time for the task he
had no objection to another’s correcting it. Gomperz requested, however,
that a new translation of the Inaugural, and that of Utilitarianism, be
entrusted to his friend Adolph Wahrmund, an Oriental scholar, and that a
formal statement of Mill’s consent be forwarded, so as to give Gomperz
“the advantage of a fuller control over these translations [than he]
could otherwise exercise.” Indeed he admitted that Wahrmund had already
completed the major part of the latter task, and had “submitted without
reluctance to a careful revision” by Gomperz himself.

To all this effort and enthusiasm Mill responded warmly, in a letter of
23 April;63 but before any volumes were published, the firm of Tendler
went bankrupt later that year. There was no hint of trouble, however, in
Gomperz’s reply of 11 May,64 and apparently no further explanation
forthcoming either of this Edition: current; Page: [xxvii]
disappointment or of the later renegotiation of the project with the
Fues Verlag of Leipzig.

Mill wrote again, in March of the following year (1413 below), to
inquire about the edition, because he had “just received an agreeable
evidence of the demand for it” in another proposal for a series of his
works, which he proceeded to outline.65 To his question, Mill seems to
have had no reply, as on 15 June he gave Gomperz yet another gentle
nudge, and for a similar reason. He had received several requests from
aspiring translators for the recently issued Subjection of Women, and
since it was “very desirable that this should be done immediately,” he
had “accepted the offer of Dr Heinemann . . . reserving [Gomperz’s]
right to include in the collected edition either his translation by
agreement with him or a different translation.”66 Three weeks later, on
6 July, Mill responded in a similar vein (1454A below, previously
unpublished) to a letter from Anton Dohrn, agreeing to Dohrn’s issuing
his translation of the Inaugural, “merely reserving the right of the
publishers of the complete edition to include it (or another
translation) afterwards in their series.”

From Gomperz he appears to have received only an announcement of his
marriage, which took place on 8 August of that year. On 23 October Mill
replied with warm congratulations and a request for information, not for
himself, but for an acquaintance, whose address he enclosed, who was
anxious to discover how the system of secret voting actually functioned
in those countries where it had been adopted. The edition was not
mentioned.67

This is the last letter in Mill’s correspondence with Gomperz, as his
son Heinrich testifies, adding, in some surprise, that Mill never
thanked his father for the first volume of the Gesammelte Werke (1869),
which certainly must have been sent to him.68 Whether it was indeed
sent, or whether the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war in July of that
year had any effect upon the arrangements, it almost certainly never
arrived, since it is inconceivable that Mill would not have acknowledged
its appearance.

There was a hiatus of four years before the publication of Volumes II-IV
of the edition which contained, at last, Gomperz’s translation of the
Logic. Heinrich Gomperz claimed that he did not know why it had taken so
long.69 It was just at the time of Mill’s death that the final volume of
the three was issued. In his letter of condolence to Helen Taylor of 11
May, 1873, Gomperz said he would send to her “the eight volumes of the
translation of Mr. Mill’s works that have just come Edition: current;
Page: [xxviii] out.”70 It is doubtful whether this intention was ever
carried out, as in his letter of 25 November, 1873, thanking Helen for a
copy of the Autobiography, he concluded: “If you would be good enough to
let me know your residence, I would send you the nine volumes which have
appeared (the ninth is being published at this moment).”71 The tenth
volume, which he said was also being printed at that time, was the first
of the two-volume Dissertations and Discussions, translated by Wessel.
It appears that none of these volumes was despatched as suggested,
however, and that two more years elapsed before the publication of the
second volume of the collected essays, because the publisher made
difficulties about some of the subject matter. It was October, 1875
before Elise Gomperz could write to Helen: “My husband hopes that you
have received the eleven volumes of the translation he directed Mr.
Reisland to send you.”72 These reached their destination, and now form
part of the Somerville College collection.

Gomperz was apparently relying on his friend Wessel to complete the
translation of the works to be included in the final volume of the
edition, and Wessel’s death in January, 1879 left him in dire need of
assistance. He found it in the person of Sigmund Freud, who was
recommended by his former philosophy professor, Franz Brentano, a
colleague and friend of Gomperz at the University of Vienna.73 Another
year elapsed, however, before the twelfth volume appeared. When it did,
Gomperz sent copies to Helen without delay,74 and surely with a sense of
relief that his commitment to making Mill’s works available in German
was at last fulfilled. He could now, with a clear conscience, devote all
his time to Edition: current; Page: [xxix] his own writings on classical
thought,75 which, in their own way, would continue to spread the
influence of Mill’s empiricism in scholarly Europe.


EAST INDIA CORRESPONDENCE

mill’s work and influence at the East India Company has been the least
studied area of his much explored life and thought. The record he
compiled of the more than 1700 despatches that he drafted over the
course of his thirty-five years in the Examiner’s Office of the
Company76 is daunting, even to scholars with a Benthamite bent for
lists. It is only recently, thanks to the efforts of Martin and Zawahir
Moir, co-editors with John M. Robson of Mill’s Writings on India, that
his despatches have become really accessible,77 and we anticipate that
there will now be considerably more investigation of the role he played
in the history of British India.

As the Moirs located the various versions of the despatches, other
treasures of three kinds emerged from the collections: letters in Mill’s
own hand to an official in another department, supplying further
information about the matters dealt with in the documents; letters in a
clerk’s hand, signed by Mill, as Examiner of India Correspondence,
1856-58, usually making requests to the Finance and Home Committee of
the Company; and copies of letters, some with Mill’s signature, written
when, as Examiner, he served as Clerk to the Secret Committee of the
Court of Directors and communicated their views to the Board of
Control.78 About half of the letters from that Committee are purely
formal requests for the release by the Board of secret documents. These
we have simply listed, in Appendix B, with a brief indication of the
subject matter. The other seventy-three we are delighted to be able to
include here, as they provide new insight into the nature of Mill’s
responsibilities at the East India House, and illustrate its complex
bureaucracy.

The workings of that bureaucracy were described and commented upon by
officials of the Company, including Mill, as they answered the questions
of an investigating Parliamentary Select Committee in 1852;79 and they
have been further explained and analysed in Martin Moir’s admirable
Introduction to Volume XXX of the Collected Works. Some of that
explanation bears repeating here, however, to give proper context to the
letters below.

Edition: current; Page: [xxx]
The East India Company was governed by two different bodies: the Court
of Directors, elected from among its Proprietors (the shareholders); and
what was known as the Board of Control, composed of a number of
commissioners appointed by the British government to oversee the
Company’s operations. The Directors served on various standing
committees, responsible for specific aspects of the Company’s
activities;80 and to assist them in their administration they had a
great number of paid officers and clerks in several departments. The
Secretary was the senior official of the Company, and next to him was
the Examiner, in charge of the office that had responsibility for
drafting most of the despatches to India.81 The Board, which was in
practice dominated by its chief commissioner, the President, also had a
number of officials and clerks to help carry out its supervisory role.
The dual nature of this administration resulted in a complex procedural
ritual for the handling of the correspondence with India, in which there
were as many as six stages.82

An abstract of each despatch received from India was made in the
department and circulated to the Chairman and Deputy Chairman (the
Chairs) of the Court and the members of the relevant standing committee.
If the matter was purely routine, a member of the Correspondence branch
of the Examiner’s office, such as Mill, would prepare a draft reply,
which would be submitted, with a collection of accompanying documents,
for the approval of the Chairs. (In delicate or difficult matters, the
officer would take instruction from them before preparing the draft.)
When each draft conformed to the views of the Chairmen (stage 1), it
would be passed on for the unofficial consideration of the President of
the Board (stage 2) in a form known as “PC” (“previous communication”).
If the President returned it unaltered, it moved directly to the
departmental standing committee. If he made alterations, the draft was
returned to the Chairmen (stage 3), who had discretion to “allow wholly
or partially, or reject entirely, the alterations,”83 before passing it
on to the committee, which also had discretion to introduce changes
(stage 4). The official draft was next discussed, possibly amended
further, and passed by the Court of Directors (stage 5). Then it
returned once more to the Board as a whole for its official approval
(stage 6). If accepted, it was immediately despatched to India. If
altered at this late stage, it was again referred to the standing
committee, “upon whose report the Court decide[d], either that the
alterations [should] be acquiesced in, . . . or that a remonstrance
[should] be addressed to the Board against Edition: current; Page:
[xxxi] the alterations, in which case the draft [was] sent back until
the final decision of the Board [was] communicated, and then the
despatch [was] forwarded.”84

All the opportunities for alterations to the drafts in this description
suggest that changes were more common, and more substantive, than was in
fact the case. It was clearly in the best interests of the Company and
of its officials and employees that unnecessary hitches or
confrontations not occur in a procedure that was already slow and
cumbersome enough, and matters were conducted so as to ensure a smooth
passage of a draft through the system. We have, unfortunately, no record
of Mill’s conferring with the Chairmen, or receiving their advice, prior
to drafting a despatch; but there are indications that the Chairs
occasionally sounded out the President in a “Pre-PC” or “official draft
sent ahead of the more formal PC in order to elicit his first
reactions.”85 We know, from Mill’s evidence before the Commons
Committee, that the Chairs rarely submitted a PC to the Board which they
knew to contain opinions directly contrary to those of the President.86
We also know, from the letters below, that disagreement occasionally
occurred, and that Mill experienced the frustrations that normally
result from bureaucratic delay and bungling.

In 229.02, for example, from the first group of letters, one of many
addressed to William Cabell, Senior Clerk in the Political Department
and Assistant Secretary to the Board of Control, we see Mill attempting
to resolve a difference of opinion between the Chairs and the President
concerning the affairs of Oudh: “If the President after reading the Oude
P.C. should continue of his former opinion I should be much obliged to
you if you would suggest to me the sort of modification which would best
meet the President’s views.” The difficulties entailed by the pace of
the process and the multiplicity of drafts is illustrated in 241.1,
where Mill is writing to ask whether the PC forwarded to the Board three
months earlier “is likely to be soon returned?” Several other PCs were
being held up by it; so he “would venture to suggest that in case any
point or points should require prolonged consideration . . . the paras
relating to them might perhaps be detached & made into a separate PC &
the rest proceeded with.” In 290.2, Mill offers Cabell an abject apology
for “a gross & untraceable blunder in this office . . . one of the
absurdest pieces of official negligence I have ever known of.” It had
resulted in the original version of a despatch being sent to the Board a
second time, “instead of a greatly altered PC which I prepared & which
the Chairs sanctioned.” Such errors and delays were probably not so
infrequent in the Company’s operation as Mill suggests.

About half of the letters below to Cabell serve to illustrate stage 2 of
the complicated processing of despatches. Having received Mill’s draft
PC, forwarded Edition: current; Page: [xxxii] after its approval by the
Chairmen for the Board’s consideration, Cabell occasionally asked for
more documentation or clarification of some aspect of the matter at
hand; for example, in 96.2, 125.1, and 239.3 below, Mill is responding
to various sorts of requests. In the first, he reports that no trace had
been found of a project that was thought to have appeared in despatches
some number of years earlier; in the second, he records success in
locating an agreement of even more recent date than the one the Board
had requested; in the third, he provides a direct answer to a question
regarding the desirability of asking for an explanation from the local
government. Most responses, however, are more complex than these.

In 76.1 below, for instance, Mill is replying to the Board’s query
whether the government in India had the legal power “to detain a civil
servant in India against his will.” The question was apparently referred
by the Examiner (then James Mill) to the solicitor retained by the
Company, and Mill is duly reporting this man’s legal opinion. The
context of the question, and several of Mill’s comments, reveal some of
the characteristic features of the problems encountered by the Home
Establishment in dealing with events in the field and in the handling of
the despatches.

At issue was the case of Mordaunt Ricketts, the Resident at Lucknow, who
had been dismissed for taking bribes and had left India before any other
punitive action could be launched against him. As was so frequently the
case, the officials at home were having to judge after the fact whether
a matter had been properly handled on the spot, what measures could or
should have been taken to ensure a different outcome, and what
recommendations ought to be made to direct policy in the future. In this
instance, the Board wanted to know whether, and how, Ricketts’s
departure could have been prevented.

Mill’s reply affirms that the Government might have applied for some
sort of restraining order on Ricketts from the Supreme Court, but that
the application might not have been successful, given “the presumption
they could have established against him.” This fact and the likelihood
of his being able to get away “before process could have issued” should
determine, in Mill’s view, the official attitude of the Home
Establishment to the Indian Government’s conduct in the matter: “it is
perhaps more than we could be warranted in affirming positively here
that they were wrong in not making such an application.” One of the
functions of the despatches, to assess fairly what had been done in the
field with a view to improving performance by analysis, and criticism
when necessary, is demonstrated here.87 In this case, with great tact,
Mill moves on to suggest a legislative change: that power be given to
the Indian Government, allowing it in future cases to detain “its
servants in India until their accounts with Government are settled.”

In 249.1 below, Mill himself provides a legal opinion in answer to a
question directed to him by Robert Gordon, one of the two Secretaries to
the Board of Edition: current; Page: [xxxiii] Control. The Board was
considering the problem raised in the estate of the late postmaster at
Ryepur by the questionable legitimacy of his children, who had been born
before his marriage to their mother. Gordon had apparently been told
that, since the parents were Catholics, the provision of the Canon Law,
by which a subsequent marriage of the parents legitimized the children,
might be applicable. Mill, “although unable to refer him at once to any
authority.” sounds quite certain as he explains the legal history—that
the barons of England, unwilling to change the laws of the land under
church pressure, had rejected this principle. Though it was relevant in
Scotland and France, whose laws were of Roman origin, it was not
applicable in an English jurisdiction. Mill’s legal studies are not
often so evidently on display.

In his capacity as drafter of political PCs, Mill was, technically, the
voice of the Chairs, but it is certain that the contents of the
despatches were very much of his own devising, a fact that is reflected,
for example, in 308.1 below. Cabell had written to ask whether, in
composing a particular paragraph, Mill had given proper weight to the
opinion of James Sutherland, the Political Agent at Gujerat, which
presumably was included in the collection Cabell was examining. Mill
confirms that he had indeed taken Sutherland’s views into consideration,
but had been persuaded to come to a different conclusion based on other
evidence.

The same responsibility for the opinions expressed in a PC under
consideration by the Board of Control is demonstrated in a later reply
(still at the second stage of the progress of the despatches through the
system) to the questions of Thomas Nelson Waterfield, Cabell’s successor
in the Political Department. In 339.1, of 16 January, 1842, Mill
explains why he draws a distinction between one division of ceded
territory and the others, and the conclusion he has reached as to the
Company’s right to dues from it, grounding his reasons solidly on the
evidence of the Resident who had negotiated the relevant treaty in
1817.88 He also gives his interpretation of a separate treaty of the
same period between two local rulers, affirming that the Company had
been making a mistake, irreparable so long after the event, in paying
over the dues in question to one of them. The Chairs must have
concurred, but the voice is Mill’s.

Three letters in the collection illustrate the third stage in the
processing of despatches, the consideration by the Chairmen of any
alterations to the PCs made at the Board. In the matter of treaties with
native princes, discussed in 103.1 below, the President, in adding to a
paragraph, had given more status to some of the Boondela chiefs and to
other individuals with hereditary rights to collect rents than they
merited, and Mill is writing to explain why the alteration is being
Edition: current; Page: [xxxiv] rejected. “The Chairman has often seen
them when he was in Bundelcund and says they are petty Jageerdars of no
sort of consequence, and their engagements are not treaties but are
constituted by Sunnuds on our part, & acknowledgments of allegiance on
theirs.”89 Mill adds that “we have made several additions to this PC
since it returned to us. We find that it saves much time & trouble to
continue the subjects up to the latest advices.” The instances in which
additional information about a given matter reached the home office as
the discussion was in progress were obviously frequent. In this
situation, however, Mill saw no difficulty created; the Board would
simply be informed of the new circumstances when the PC was sent to it a
second time for final approval.

Two other letters, 294.2 and 296.1, also contain criticism of the
Board’s alterations in a recently returned PC. In discussing the matter
at issue, however, Mill relies on his own knowledge of the local rulers
in making the objection:

It strikes me that the plan suggested by the Board would never answer.
We could manage the villages of a native prince & pay over the revenues
to him, because he can trust us—besides he must. But they never trust
one another, & there is no instance among them I believe of a joint
property in which the agents of both sharers do not exercise a right of
joint management. It must end therefore in our managing the villages for
both governments; which neither would like.

He follows the observations with another suggestion about a change that
might be implemented by a recommendation from the Board: “Would it not
be better to refer to the Govt of India as a general question, the
possibility of negotiating an arrangement by which the double Revenue
agency might be avoided?” And in the subsequent letter to Cabell, four
weeks later, he adds more argument to “the remarks which I took the
liberty of privately communicating to you.” A third party to the
question, the Raja of Nagpur, would never be satisfied with the
arrangement. “It is not the money, but the tenure, as an ancient family
possession, that he is solicitous about; & no money grant would
compensate him for the cession of a privilege venerated for its
antiquity.”

Mill’s objection to another alteration by the Board, in 239.2 below,
relates simply to its wording: “I do not clearly understand in what
manner the Joonaghur chief is to continue his responsibility for the
Babrias, when he is specifically interdicted from interfering with them.
It strikes me that a clearer statement of the Board’s intentions would
be desirable & would facilitate the passing of the Draft through the
Court.” Cabell obliged immediately with a better version that clarified
Edition: current; Page: [xxxv] the matter for the benefit of the
Chairmen, the members of the Political and Military Committee, and the
Court, who were to consider it next, in stages 4 and 5 of the process.

The complications that could arise from the dual authority between the
Board and the Court and the multiplicity of despatches are admirably
illustrated in the problem created by Mr. Williams, the Resident and
Commissioner at Baroda, which Mill discusses in 212.1 below. He is
writing to explain why orders for Williams’s dismissal are included in
the PC on Baroda that he is forwarding with this letter, when similar
orders incorporated by the Board in an earlier PC on the Mahi Kantha had
been rejected. The Board is to understand the delicacy of choosing the
proper grounds for the dismissal. It would be “more just and less
embarrassing in its consequences” if Williams’s removal were for

general unfitness . . . than for specific instances of misconduct of
which his superiors (the Bombay government of the time) must share the
blame & which the home authorities when they first animadverted on them
did not deem worthy of so serious a punishment, for you will observe
that the misconduct of Mr Williams in regard to the Myhee Caunta was as
fully known to the Court when they sent out their last despatch on that
subject as it is now.

A little face-saving all round is recommended in this matter. Why it
would also be “more just” to fire Williams for general rather than
specific reasons seems to relate to the case of his assistant, Mr.
Erskine, whom the Board had ordered dismissed with him in the Mahi
Kantha PC. “This seems very severe treatment for an error of judgment
which in him was comparatively venial.” In Mill’s view it would be “hard
to ruin the entire prospects of a young man,” given the circumstances of
the case. The wisdom and utility of dealing with Williams through the
Baroda channel as outlined is most tactfully, but at the same time
forcefully, made. The Board did not seem to get the point, however, as
six months later, in 233.1, Mill is once against suggesting that the
Chairs want Williams’s conduct criticized in a general way.

Letter 271.1 below illustrates Mill’s role in the processing of the
despatches in its fourth stage, the consideration of the drafts by the
relevant committee of the Court. Replying to a question from the Board
about the reasons for the “additional matter in para 7” of the despatch
they were considering for the second time, Mill explains that

it was inserted in the Political Committee on the proposition of a
Director & I presume he cannot have adverted to the passages in the
Collection, to which you have now been so obliging as to refer me. (If I
had remembered their existence I would have pointed them out to him.)
His object was to discourage the Government from embarrassing themselves
with the domestic disputes of stipendiaries.

In this case, Mill seems to think that the Board has the better view,
and one regrets not being able to report whether anything further was
done in the matter. It is interesting to note, however, that Mill was in
close contact with the members of the Edition: current; Page: [xxxvi]
Political Committee as they considered his despatches, presumably
assisting them, as requested, in their deliberations.

From the Committee, the despatch moved on to the Court of Directors,
where further changes might be introduced. Letter 287.1 illustrates this
fifth stage, and the power of the Court to influence policy. Sending
Cabell some advance notice of the “two material variations” that the
Board would find in the recently approved despatch “which either has
been or will be immediately sent to you from the Court in the official
form,” Mill explains the Court’s changes. The first of their alterations
was in support “of the proposed reform of the Jyepore Army by the
substitution for the greater part of it of a force under British
officers,” as this was in line with “Lord Auckland’s views on the
subject of bringing the armies of the native states under our control as
opportunities offer,” to which they had recently grown “much more
favourable.” The second change was again related to the misconduct of an
employee. In the case of Major Borthwick, the Court had decided on the
evidence that the accusation by the local ruler of Borthwick’s having
misappropriated funds was false, and the paragraph of criticism had been
removed.

The apparently persistent problem of incompetent or dishonest officials
of the Company in the field is also the issue in another letter, 49.01,
that again illustrates Mill’s efforts to prepare for the sixth stage of
the process, final approval by the Board. The Court having passed
“Bengal Political Draft No 237,” which contained criticism of an
employee, Mill is returning it to the Board, pointing out that
“explanations” from this individual had been recently received from
India. In Mill’s opinion, they warrant making only “verbal” alterations
“in the strictures on his conduct,” and not holding up the Draft
altogether; but Mill defers to the possibility of a different view at
the Board, suggesting various courses of action open, and leaving the
matter to Cabell’s discretion: “When you have decided which of these
alternatives to adopt, we will act accordingly.”

Mill’s position as Assistant in the Correspondence Branch of the
Examiner’s office in the long middle period of his career, from 1828 to
two years before his retirement, was clearly one of great
responsibility, and there can be no doubt that he earned the respect and
the admiration of his colleagues both for his drafts and for his skills
as a negotiator. Though there is a little, and humorous, evidence, that
they occasionally believed him to be mistaken,90 his move upward to the
senior post in the office, on the retirement of Thomas Love Peacock and
David Hill in 1856, must have seemed to all concerned a normal and
well-earned promotion. Then, as the new Examiner of India
Correspondence, Mill naturally assumed some different duties, at least a
few of which are fortunately illustrated in the other two series of
letters that have recently come to light. One of these is addressed to
the Finance and Home Committee of the Company, which, as its title
suggests, was Edition: current; Page: [xxxvii] responsible for matters
relating to the employees, the premises, and the records of the Home
Establishment.

Mill’s correspondence with this Committee would not have been regular in
the years before his promotion, but one letter does survive amongst the
Finance and Home Committee papers from the earlier period. It is dated 9
April, 1844 (427.1), and is a statement in support of his brother
George’s application for employment by the Company. The short note
testifies to the superior “acquirements . . . conduct & character” of
the young man, which Mill, as his chief tutor, was well qualified to
know. Its success also testifies to the “high status and influence” that
Mill himself enjoyed by that time in the Company, and to the fact that
his own “experimental apprenticeship in the 1820s [had] provided the
Company with the kind of model it later used in training other potential
despatch writers,” such as George, who joined the Correspondence Branch
and learned the job under his brother’s supervision. The nepotism that
was traditional (“dynasties of family employees were quite common in the
Company’s history”) and generally and unashamedly practised in the
nineteenth century is also illustrated by this episode.91

The twenty-seven later letters, from Mill as Examiner 1856-58, to the
Home and Finance Committee, treat of more mundane subjects, and
underline the irony that is often inherent in promotion. Any alterations
to, or maintenance of, the “physical plant,” as we now say, had to be
approved in principle, and in advance, by the Committee, as 258A, B, and
D, and 286D illustrate. In the first, Mill is requesting an extra
office, and suggests the necessity of providing yet another room,
because “It frequently happens that permission is granted by the
Chairman to gentlemen in the Honorable Company’s Service or others, to
consult the official records either for public or private purposes, and
there is at present no place in which they can make use of such
permission except the compound of the Clerks in the Office.” The second
is a request that “one of the two extra offices” be included in “the
general order for painting.” The third is to report that “the new room
ordered by the Honorable Committee for Mr Kaye92 is now completed, and
to solicit that provision of the necessary furniture may be sanctioned.”
The last is in support of a letter from the Assistant Registrar in the
Book Office, “representing the necessity of whitewashing the rooms
occupied by his Department, and of effecting some minor improvements” in
them. Diligently bureaucratic, Mill affirms: “I have the honor to state
that from personal inspection I can confirm Mr Atkins’ representations,
and I beg to recommend that his proposals be carried into effect.”

Changes in the accommodation of the Company’s records, the payment of
the Edition: current; Page: [xxxviii] workmen involved, and the
destruction of “old and useless duplicate Collections” also required the
Committee’s approval (258E and G, 260B, 269B, and 286C). An increased
volume of work in the Examiner’s Office necessitated the hiring of extra
staff, which was sanctioned for periods of six months at a time (258G,
262D, 269C, 283A, 293A, and 306A). Provisions for individual employees,
of various kinds, also required the Committee’s sanction. Leave of
absence on account of illness had to be extended (269A); the death of an
employee required his being replaced (258C), and his salary continued to
his widow for the current quarter (258F); an official who had expended a
great deal of extra time and effort on preparing a report for Parliament
was entitled to special remuneration (323A); the petition from the
messengers in the Book Office had to be forwarded (309B). It is not
certain whether Mill actually dictated these letters or whether most
were simply prepared for his signature. We do know, however, as noted
above, that he personally ascertained that the Registrar’s rooms needed
whitewashing.

As Examiner, Mill had to deal with the bureaucratic trivia of his
office, and some of the problems in his employees’ lives. He was also
concerned with more apparently important matters in his capacity as
Clerk to the Secret Committee of the Court, which was composed of the
two Chairmen and a senior Director, and handled matters relating to war,
peace, and diplomacy. The third series of letters, addressed from this
Committee to Waterfield or to one of the Secretaries of the Board,
number forty-three, twenty-six of which are simply official requests for
the release of documents, and are listed, with their subjects, in
Appendix B. The other seventeen also have their touch of (secret)
bureaucratic trivia, in two requests (283C and 299B) for the Board’s
consent to the employment in the Secret Department of particular
individuals, “on their taking the prescribed oath.” The remaining
fifteen letters, which throw light on a variety of contemporary
problems, are of considerable historical and political interest.

The first is a proposed agreement between Britain and France, apparently
suggested as early as 1852, for a mutually beneficial exchange of
territory in India, France seeming anxious to consolidate her
possessions around Pondicherry. The terms of the exchange—that is,
finding settlements of equivalent value on both sides—were difficult to
arrange, however, and several different plans came under discussion. In
the five letters below on the subject, 260A, 263B, 266A, 283B, and 309A,
over a period of almost two years, it is clear that the chief concern
both of the Secret Committee and of the Board is with matters of
revenue, though the political advantage for Britain is thought to be of
some interest as well. It is also evident that both bodies had to rely
heavily on the assessment of the situation by the government in India.

A second problem, dealt with in six letters, was that created by the
brief war with Persia from November 1856 to March 1857, the dispute
centring on the fortress city of Herat. These letters demonstrate the
role of the Board as a channel of communication for the British
Government with the Court. In 262F, for Edition: current; Page: [xxxix]
example, the Secret Committee is responding to a letter from the
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, asking whether “it might be advisable to
take possession of Mohummerah for the purpose of increasing pressure
upon Persia.” The Committee was forwarding all the information they had
that might be relevant, but refrained “from expressing any opinion on
the course which it might be most expedient to adopt.” The Committee had
a more positive reaction to questions about “postal communication for
Government purposes . . . during the present war” in 270B, agreeing with
Lord Clarendon’s view that “Bagdad via Constantinople” would be the best
route, and notifying the government that “Lieutenant General Sir James
Outram [head of the Company’s army for ‘the Persian Expedition’] will
therefore be apprised of the arrangment and instructed to send to Her
Majesty’s Ambassador a short summary of any important intelligence,
which could be put into cypher at the Embassy and so forwarded by
telegraph.”

The presence of the telegraph by this time (at least as far as
Constantinople) makes it seem less odd to think that the Secret
Committee in London had also to be consulted about orders for individual
officers and arrangements for specific missions (262E, 286E, 321A). It
was to facilitate the establishment of a more extensive telegraph system
that Britain had obtained the Kuria Muria islands from the Imam of
Muscat in 1854, a cession whose legality Mill questions in 270D,
relative to another issue—the difficulty of protecting British citizens
granted rights to exploit the guano of those islands.

Another problem in the Persian Gulf area is the subject of perhaps the
most interesting of these letters from the Secret Committee, 283D below,
concerning the actions of that flamboyant lieutenant in the Bombay Army,
just beginning his career as an explorer of exotic places, Richard
Burton. On leave late in 1854, Burton had undertaken his first trip into
the interior of Somaliland (against the wishes of Outram, the Political
Agent of the day at Aden), and had subsequently recommended to the
Company that an agency be established at Berbera, a plan that the
Governor of Bombay solidly rejected. Burton had then made the suggestion
in a letter to the Royal Geographical Society, on which the Committee is
commenting, readily concurring “in the observation of the Board
respecting the impropriety of Lieutenant Burton’s conduct in addressing
to the Geographical Society criticisms on the political measures of the
Government of India.” An accompanying letter in the collection contains
a comment to the effect that the Society ought to be discouraged from
publishing Burton’s letter93—and indeed it did not appear at that time,
a fact that perhaps demonstrates the Company’s power, when it so wished,
to save itself embarrassment.

That the Examiner’s title was “Clerk” to the Secret Committee in its
communications with the Board is probably just another instance of an
inadequate Edition: current; Page: [xl] job description. It was surely
proper that only the most senior official in the Correspondence Branch
should be admitted to the very highest level of deliberation in the
Company, but his contribution was likely greater than merely that of a
secretary. Mill himself probably exercised substantial influence in that
Committee, as he had when he conferred with the Chairmen about the
contents of his despatches; and he clearly enjoyed the confidence of the
Court, the Board, and the government, as evidenced by his being offered
a post in 1858 on the newly established Council of India. That he
declined to accept it, since he disapproved of the government’s
assumption of control and needed “a long recruiting, not so much from
work, as from the confinement of an office” (324), is no surprise.

the discovery of Mill’s letters in the archival series of the India
Office Library and Records has greatly enriched our knowledge both of
his career and of the East India Company’s operations, and has also
confirmed our collective certainty that the task of editing Mill’s
correspondence will not end with Volume XXXII of the Collected Works. It
is more than probable that, as scholars continue to consult the
collections of despatches, other letters will emerge, and that
previously unknown items will appear in the pages of dealers’
catalogues. We would be most grateful if readers continue to report
their discoveries, through the University of Toronto Press, so that the
record may be kept entire.

At the conclusion of this volume are six Appendices: Appendix A contains
the variant readings derived from a collation of copies of the
manuscript letters to Theodor Gomperz at Kokugakuin University with
those letters to him in Collected Works not reprinted here. Appendix B
provides a list of the form letters from the Clerk of the Secret
Committee of the East India Company to the Board of Control requesting
the release of various secret documents. Appendix C contains some
additions to the finding list of Mill’s Indian despatches in Volume XXX
of the Collected Works. Appendix D provides a list of letters to Mill,
compiled in response to many requests from readers over the years. Once
more, we must mention our debt to Professor Mineka, who had listed the
holdings at Yale and Johns Hopkins and made photocopies of the latter,
thereby greatly facilitating the process of checking for accuracy. The
Mill-Taylor Collection is, of course, the other principal repository of
such letters.94 We conducted a further search, using references
suggested in the footnotes to Volumes XII-XVIII, and through relevant
printed sources, and were thus able to locate some previously unknown
correspondence. Again, we ask readers to share their knowledge, for the
record, of other “In” letters that may have been overlooked. Appendix E
contains an index of the recipients of the letters printed in this
volume.

Since Appendix F serves as an index to persons, writings, and statutes,
Edition: current; Page: [xli] references to them do not appear in the
general Index, which has been prepared with the care and efficiency that
is her hallmark by Dr. Jean O’Grady.

TO GEORGE AND HARRIET GROTE1

East India House

1st September, 1824

My dear friends,

Not knowing which of you to write to, and being thus placed in the
situation of the ass, I am wiser than he, and instead of starving I
seize both the bundles of hay,2 and write to you both. Your journal has
been received, & read with great interest, but we have been grieved to
hear of Mr Grote’s indisposition, and surprised to learn that you have
had so much rain. Last week was with us one of the finest weeks we have
had this summer, and the harvest-work which has been done surpasses all
belief. This week is equally fine, and corn will be excessively
cheap—especially as I hear the harvest is as far advanced in Scotland as
here.—I suppose you will be more interested by hearing all that has
passed in the Utilitarian world since your departure, than by anything
else that I can say.—In the first place, then, last Monday week my
father and I dined with Hume, where we met Anthony Hammond, and on the
whole we are very much satisfied with that personage.3 Without being
much of a philosopher, or possessing very clear or definite notions on
law and legislation in general, he carries his ideas of reform to a
Edition: current; Page: [2] very great extent. He has already
consolidated the whole of the Criminal Law, which it is intended to
bring into Parlt either as one bill or a series of bills so as to
supersede all the present system:4 he means next to go to work upon the
civil law, & consolidate that too: but this consolidation he himself
declares to be only preparatory to a complete codification of the whole
law, common & statute: on the subject of which he has very rational
ideas; and he says it would destroy the whole of the system of pleading
as at present constituted, and would leave nothing to the discretion of
the judge, of the evils of which he has a very strong impression. Hume
expressed on the same occasion some most admirable opinions on the
subject of charity, which he declared that he had recently adopted, &
tho’ they seemed new to Hammond, he came into them tolerably well.—In
the next place, William Whitmore has brought his cousin the member to
call upon my father at the India House.5 As I was conversing all the
time he staid, with Wm W. in a separate part of the room, I heard very
little of what passed between my father & the other Whitmore; but my
father says that he fully understands the question of the corn laws,
which was the only subject on which they conversed: that he understands
not only the general principle, but its practical bearings: & he
declares himself fully resolved, if the ministers do not anticipate him,
to bring forward a motion & force a discussion every session until he
succeeds in carrying the question. As there will be an elaborate article
in the Edin. Rev. by M‘Culloch to prepare the way before him, it will be
of great importance that we should have an article in the Westminster
Review which may bear a comparison with it: for this purpose we are
anxious to ascertain, first, whether Whitmore can, and secondly, whether
he will, write one.6 William W. whom we employed to get us a copy of
Whitmore’s Edition: current; Page: [3] pamphlet, as a sort of test of
his capability, wormed out of Prescott7 our ulterior designs, & has
taken them up with the utmost eagerness.—I dined at Wimbledon with Mr
Tooke8 on Friday last, having gone from the India House to his counting
house, & thence with him to his carriage at a quarter before five: from
which time till near eleven, we were engaged almost without intermission
in discussing the exclusion of Irish labourers.9 In the course of the
dispute he was driven, among other things, to deny the principle of
population. I could perceive considerable annoyance on his part at the
escape of Eyton from the paternal apron string: Two or three times he
put him down with considerable harshness, & was continually making
indirect hits against the dogmatism, & want of candour, of some of his
opponents; by which some, he meant Eyton: who took as well the indirect
as the direct reproofs, with the most infidel charity & resignation. I
contrived, towards the close of the evening to take a turn with Eyton in
the garden, and we had some very profitable conversation: he is eager to
do whatever good he can, & to qualify himself for doing more.—The
Austins are now domiciled at your quondam lodging on Brockham Green: and
we regularly walk with Austin on the Sunday when we go down.10 I am in
considerable doubt whether the review of Preuves will ever make its
appearance, tho’ I am informed by Mrs Austin that he works at it
Edition: current; Page: [4] during a portion of every day.11 I wish he
could complete any thing, no matter what: as a given quantity of
reputation, plus a given number of pounds sterling, would probably
supply as great a stimulus, as his mental constitution is capable of
receiving.—Charles Austin12 has been laid up, but is now, I believe, at
Norwich, whence he goes to Southampton, & returns not till October.
Bingham is absent: Graham not yet returned: Ellis fast bound in his new
office, so that the Utilitarian community stagnates.13 Our society waxes
thin, & but for the approaching batch, I should say it verged fast to
decay. Patten has withdrawn: Secretan has tendered his resignation; his
brother having been appointed manager to the marine department of the
Alliance, the conduct of the business falls wholly upon him, & he says
it leaves him no time for attendance on the society, nor yet upon our
Pol. Ec. Conversations.14 If he leaves us it is all over with him. En
revanche, I can give the most favorable bulletin of Harfield & of Edw.
Ellis.15 The former produced at the last meeting of the society an essay
on population, which obtained universal, and, considering it as a first
attempt, well-deserved applause; in it he kept the promise he had made,
of writ-ing sar-cas-ti-cal-ly, and some of the sar-casm was exceedingly
good. He complained however that we all laughed at his or-tho-e-py,
Edition: current; Page: [5] (vulgarly called pronunciation): and in
truth we had good reason: Doane16 complimented him upon having written a
ighly-able, a excellent, a admirable, and in some parts, a ironical
essay. Edward Ellis is studying political economy with so much ardour
and application, as leaves no fear of his ultimate success in that and
in every other branch of useful knowledge which he attempts.—Next, as to
our occupations: My father is about to open his battery upon the
Quarterly Review: I am still upon Brodie: Ellis is upon the Elements of
Pol. Ec.17 Of the occupations of any one else among our friends, I am in
ignorance, except as to Arfield,18 who is reading I do not know how many
books, & writing, or about to write, I do not know how many essays.—A
critique on the first number of the W.R. has appeared in the North
American Review: They quote largely from the first article, which they
applaud greatly, as well as Bingham’s two articles on America (tho’ they
say he knows very little about America—as how can he? or any one here:—&
that his stateme[nts] are some of them no longer true, & others never
were true).19 They also m[ake] an ingenious attempt to shew, that the
Whigs & Tories are two [aristo]cratic parties, & that the Edinburgh Rev.
only supports the aristocracy [of] the Whigs, instead of that of the
Tories.20 But farther this deponent saith no[t.] You have seen, or will
see, the attack on the 3d No. & particularly on poor Ellis, in the last
Blackwood.21 I have not seen it yet, but am to see it tomorrow. Malthus,
it Edition: current; Page: [6] seems, has been puffing himself again in
the Quarterly—tho’ I have not seen the article, it propounds what no
other mortal would think of propounding, his Measure of Value.22 Not
more certainly is our friend Satan known by his cloven foot, than the
Rev. T.R. Malthus by this unfortunate hobby.—If any thing was wanting to
ensure the success of the W.R. the badness of the Edin. R. would do it.
Only contrast the last Edin. with the last Westmr. That miserable stuff
of M‘Culloch about primogeniture must be answered23—& will, I trust,
with the grace of my lord the devil, with whose school, I have no doubt,
we are already classed by the enlightened Southey,—or, if not now, shall
be so classed, as soon as the article makes its appearance on his book
of the Church.24 When that time arrives, I shall expect to see our
names, or at any rate, that of the review, introduced into his next
dissertation de omni scibili,25 with the addition of a few gentle
epithets of disapprobation, as ruffian, miscreant, incendiary, & so
forth; or who knows? atheist, perhaps: since, as Ellis says, those who
are infidels in tithes, are necessarily infidels in all the other
doctrines of religion. The Courier has already expressed some
inclination to see “a well-seasoned mess of impiety from Carlile, dished
up by the Morning Chronicle.”26 By the way, Black is doing Edition:
current; Page: [7] admirable service—particularly with respect to the
unpaid magistracy; who, I think, must smart under his lash: he is the
greatest enemy they have.27 Prescott is, as usual, “writing an Essay for
the society.” Doane is, as far as I know, doing nothing; & Place is
doing every thing.28 With all our wishes for your welfare, & speedy
return, I remain &c

Dear Sir

I leave you the article on Pleadings, cut down to a moderate
compass—there will be more of it afterwards for another number if you
approve of it.2—I think it will do much good, & may excite
controversy—Grimgribber3 has never been attacked in a periodical
publication with any thing like the same severity—or if at all, only in
general terms. This is specific, & the lawyers will understand its drift
better.

Yours truly

Dear Sir

I send you the article on the Game Laws,2 which I hope is not too
long—there is more scratching in it than there usually is in my articles
and there will be a great deal of small print—If anything must be left
out, I think it should be some of the extracts, however of this you will
judge for yourself—I also send a little poem which was written by a
niece of Mr Mushet of the Mint,3 and given by him to me for you. All I
have to ask is that if it cannot be praised it may not be noticed at
all.

Eyton Tooke has finished his review of Lord John Russell4—I suppose he
will send it to you immediately, if he has not sent it already—

Please to send my proofs to Ellis at the Indemnity Office—He comes to
Croydon every day—

I should like to suspend a review of Brown’s works and particularly of
his Lectures upon this Life of his which has just appeared, by the Rev.
Mr Welch.5 You have not had any metaphysical articles yet—It will help
to give that variety to the work which has been wanting hitherto—I have
heard it suggested that you should have some philological
articles—Perhaps James Gilchrist6 (not Borthwick) would write one—I know
of no one else who could do it.

Yours very truly

TO JEAN BAPTISTE SAY1

London

2d March 1830

My Dear Sir,

You will, I am sure, readily believe with how much regret & sympathy all
your friends here have learned the great affliction which you have
recently sustained.2 None of them can possibly have so much reason to
know and appreciate the greatness of your loss as I have, who had so
much experience of Madame Say’s excellence, and have received so much
kindness from her. I beg that you will assure the remainder of your
family of the part which I take in their grief. My father also is most
anxious to assure you how deeply he sympathizes with you and how greatly
he esteemed and respected Madame Say. He would have written to you
himself long before this if he had not known that I was about to write.

I have myself suffered a most grievous and unexpected loss, by the death
of my poor friend Eyton Tooke, who was well-known to you as one of the
most excellent and promising of all his contemporaries, and who would
have been a blessing to his country and to his kind.3 The loss of such a
man will be felt in a thousand ways by persons who never knew him nor
were aware what things were to be expected from him if he had lived to
pursue the career of self-improvement and philanthropic exertion which
he had entered upon; and how admirable a moral influence he would have
exercised on all with whom he came in contact, by the unrivalled purity
and rectitude of his purposes, combined with the largest and most
comprehensive liberality and philanthropy. To his immediate friends, and
associates in his labour and plans, the loss is irreparable and to me
especially.

Poor Mr. Tooke, the father, although he has in some degree recovered
from the first shock, is quite incapable of writing to you either on his
own loss or on yours, and he has entrusted to me the duty of sending to
you the enclosed paragraphs, extracted from the newspapers of the time,
respecting the particulars of the fatal event.4

I owe you a long debt of gratitude for your kindness in sending me
successively the six volumes of your work,5 which I have read with the
greatest pleasure and instruction, and which I think is likely to be
read by more persons, and with more Edition: current; Page: [10]
advantage, than any other treatise on the subject which is now extant.
You will hardly be surprised that I should not quite concur in the whole
of your strictures on those whom you call the “économistes politiques
abstraits”;6 though I am forced to admit that they have frequently
occupied public attention, to the great detriment of the science, with
discussions of mere nomenclature and classification, of no consequence
except as to the manner of expressing or of teaching the principles of
the science; and that they have occasionally generalized too far, by not
taking into account a number of the modifying circumstances, which are
of importance in the various questions composing the details of the
science. I have myself derived several most important corrections of my
speculative views from your work, and from the reflections which it
suggested. I am happy to find that there is much less in your
principles, than I thought there was, which is positively at variance
with the rigidly scientific economists of this country. I believe that
their principles when duly modified, constitute a deeper and more
searching analysis of the phenomena of wealth than yours, but that they
are not materially different in their practical result. I should wish to
see the science taught in both ways; in one for the public, in the other
for students: though I sometimes lament to see that the two sorts of
teachers scarcely understand the scope or appreciate the whole merit of
each other. But the rising generation of political economists in this
country are not only capable of unity, but do actually unite both, and
you will find when their speculations come before the public, that they
have benefitted as fully by your writings as by those of Ricardo, and
partake in nothing of the forms or of the spirit of a sect or school.

I consider myself to be discharging a duty towards my friend Eyton
Tooke, who would have been so distinguished in this very department of
science, in telling you how highly he thought of your work. In one of
the last conversations I had with him, he spoke to me of it with great
admiration and expressed himself almost enthusiastically on the fine
spirit of general benevolence, and devotion to the cause of social
improvement in all its branches, which runs through the work, and which
distinguishes your writings in so honorable a manner from too many of
our English economists.

Believe me,
 Most sincerely yours

J.S. Mill

My dear Mütterlein

I set off so soon that I cannot count upon being able to call upon you
before I go, which I should have preferred rather than to write, even
without any of the additional temptations that you held out to me in
your note. I am going to spend a month on and about the lakes of
Cumberland & Westmoreland,2 & shall probably see a good deal of
Wordsworth, who when he was last in town, very kindly asked me to his
house3—but this invitation I cannot now accept, as I shall have a
companion—my friend Grant, whom I am very glad that you have at last
seen.4 His extreme modesty—for it is not exactly bashfulness—never would
let him call upon you before.

Another excellent friend of mine, Crawley,5 who frequently walks home
with Mr. Austin from the lecture,6 would, I am certain, be much pleased
by making your acquaintance—though I suppose he was afraid of intruding
upon you by coming to the proper side of your door, i.e. the inside. I
have taken upon myself to say that you will be glad to see him—& I think
I might also have safely promised that you would like him.

I look forward with great pleasure to cultivating a further acquaintance
with Mr. Empson under your auspices.7 I know not to what I can be
indebted for so very favorable an opinion as that which you mention,
except to your mütterlich Edition: current; Page: [13] kindness, which
makes you see every thing about me in far brighter colours than those of
reality.

I am very happy to hear that Mr. Austin is better. I hope Lucy is quite
recovered from all ailments.8

My dear Sir

The Bengal Political Draft No 237 having passed the Court before the
additional matter arrived from India, we did not think it worth while to
keep back the Draft, thinking that it would give less trouble to prepare
another Draft which might follow the former almost immediately. It might
perhaps be expedient, with reference to Mr Murchison’s explanations,2 to
make one or two slight alterations in the strictures on his conduct but
I think they should be only verbal.

If, however, you should be of a different opinion there are several
courses which might be taken.

The entire Draft might be kept back but I can see no advantage in this.

Or the Draft might be passed with the omission of the additional
paragraphs which were inserted subsequently to its return from P.C.

Or paras 426, 427 of the letter dated 26th August, with the collection
No 194 corresponding to these paras containing Mr Murchison’s
explanations might be added to the Kedah Collection now at the Board &
the Draft might be modified by the Board with reference to those
particular paras, the remainder of the newly arrived matter respecting
Kedah & Nanning being reserved for a future Despatch.

Or lastly, the Board might modify the Draft with reference to the whole
of the recent arrivals; but as this would introduce new matter of
considerable interest and Edition: current; Page: [14] importance, it
would, I think, be more convenient that it should be taken in the
regular course of correspondence.

When you have decided which of these alternatives to adopt, we will act
accordingly.

At any rate we were thinking of making application to the Board, for
leave to make public the Secret letter of 2d December 1831.

 Most truly yours

Dear Mütterlein

I know you will never suspect me of being indifferent to your company,
therefore I will not scruple to tell you that I had rather not come on
Friday: there will be too many without me, and one only goes to see
people in a crowd when one does not care to see them otherwise, or when
one does not venture to refuse—at least that is the case with me.

The attendance at the lectures is rather slack, certainly, but it is
chiefly from unlucky accidents. Roebuck has been ill.2—Crawley, who has
the greatest admiration for the lectures & attended regularly last year,
has for the last three or four months been dangerously ill of the only
serious illness he ever had, & is not even now recovered. Romilly has
been overwhelmed with duties insomuch that he is at this moment failing
of one very imperative one, his engagement with Cochrane (no blame to
him, however).3 Graham, ever since his appointment as Edition: current;
Page: [15] official assignee, has had all his time taken up. Strutt has
been always at the House of Commons,4 Chadwick, latterly, has been
engrossed by Mr. Bentham’s affairs;5 & so on.

I think there may be a class of some ten or a dozen next year among
persons whom I myself know, or know of.

Your question “what can Pelham do here” shews little knowledge of the
said Pelham.6 I should not at all wonder if he became a frequenter of
yours. There is much good in Bulwer.

Give my love to Lucy—I trust it is not her birthday7 which I am refusing
to celebrate.

My dear Sir,

My father has received from Mr Lawford the accompanying note on the
power of Govt to detain a civil servant in India against his will.2 It
appears they cannot do it except by application to the Supreme Court;
and it is perhaps more than we could be warranted in affirming
positively here that they were wrong in not making such an application
in Mr Ricketts’ case because there is some doubt whether the presumption
they could have established against him were such as the Court would
have proceeded upon, & because he could probably have quitted India
before process could have issued.3

As the P.C. is with you, perhaps the requisite alteration in the wording
could be most conveniently made at the Board.

Would it not be highly advisable that the Government of India should
have the Edition: current; Page: [18] power given it of detaining its
servants in India until their accounts with Government are settled? By
their covenants they are bound to remain—but it seems that the Govt
cannot compel them to do so.

Believe me
 yours faithfully

My dear Sir

I avail myself of your permission to answer your questions in my own
language.

All the chairs of Political Economy which exist in England are of very
recent foundation. The professorship at the London University you are
probably aware of: the lectures however were so ill attended that for
the last session or two none have been delivered.2 There is also a
professorship at the rival institution in Edition: current; Page: [19]
London, called King’s College.3 At Oxford a chair was founded a few
years ago by and at the expense of an individual, a wealthy banker of
London, Mr Henry Drummond. This chair has been filled successively by Mr
Senior, and Dr Whately, the present Archbishop of Dublin; and you are
doubtless acquainted with the excellent lectures which those
distinguished persons have in each successive year, published,
pursuantly to one of the provisions of the act of endowment.4 What
effect the lectures produced upon those who heard them delivered, I know
not; but when published they have added greatly to the reputation of
their authors and have conduced to the diffusion of a taste for the
science.5

Mr Pryme, a private individual, what is called in this country a
provincial barrister, (now member of parliament for the town of
Cambridge) for some years delivered lectures on political economy at
that town, on his own private authority, without any connexion with the
University: some years however after the establishment of the Oxford
Professorship, the University of Cambridge followed the example, by
recognizing Mr Pryme’s lectures and giving him the title of Professor of
Political Economy at the University.6 Whether any emoluments from the
University are annexed to the Professorship, I know not.

I am not aware of any other chairs of Political Economy in England. I am
informed that one has recently been established in the University of
Dublin through the influence of the Archbishop.7 There is no such chair
at any of the Scotch universities, but courses of political economy have
been occasionally Edition: current; Page: [20] though rarely delivered
by the Professors of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh.8 Some years ago
(during Lord Liverpool’s ministry) a number of distinguished persons at
Edinburgh presented a memorial to the King (who is the head of the
Scottish universities though not of the English) requesting that he
would authorize the establishment of a chair of Political Economy; but
their request was refused.9

The views taken of the science in the lectures delivered from these
several chairs, are of course determined by the particular opinions of
the Professors; who differ, as in the present state of the science may
be expected, on a great number of important points, but the tendency of
all their doctrines is in favour of liberty of commerce.

I had nearly forgotten to mention that there is a chair of Political
Economy at the College of Haileybury, for the education of the Civil
Servants of the East India Company. This chair has for many years been
filled by Mr Malthus.10

In answer to your question, “quelles doctrines sont aujourdhui en
faveur” I hardly know what to say. The subject is so little studied
scientifically that there can scarcely be said to be any “doctrines of
political economy” in favour among any class; but in commercial &
financial legislation the Tories are generally for keeping up the old
institutions, the Whigs and Radicals generally for the removal of
restrictions, whether imposed by monopolies, duties on importation, or
indirect taxation involving an inconvenient interference with processes
of manufacture.

There are no periodical papers which pay any special attention to
political economy. Mr MacCulloch occasionally writes articles in the
Edinburgh & Foreign Quarterly Reviews;11 and Colonel Perronet Thompson,
the proprietor of the Edition: current; Page: [21] Westminster Review,
frequently writes on questions connected with the science:12 he has
taken more pains than most men in the study of it as a science. In
Tait’s Edinburgh Magazine there are frequently good articles by a
scientific political economist.13

The University of London has I believe got over its pecuniary
difficulties, rather by reducing its expenses than by increasing its
number of pupils. But the lectures on the moral & political sciences are
so ill attended that several of the professors have ceased to lecture:
particularly the professors of Jurisprudence and Political Economy.14
The lectures best attended are those on English law and the medical
sciences,15 because those kinds of knowledge may be turned into
money—which is a consideration nearer to the heart of most English
fathers than the desire to make their sons wise or accomplished men.

I should be most happy to communicate any other information in my power,
which you may desire to possess on these or other points.

Believe me, My dear Sir
 Most sincerely yours

Sir,

I have had the honor of receiving and laying before Mr. Loch2 your
letter of the 6th Ultimo; and I am desired to express to you his
acknowledgments for the Edition: current; Page: [24] readiness with
which you have consented to afford your valuable aid in the selection of
a competent person for the office of Head Master in the Anglo Indian
College,3 and which was no more than he expected from your zeal for the
interests of Native Education in general, and of that Institution in
particular. I have also to express his obligations to you for your
remarks on the nature of the office, and on the qualifications which it
requires; and, above all, for your public spirited offer to give
preparatory instruction in the native languages to any gentleman whom
the Court may nominate to it. Such instruction, and the continued
communication with yourself which it would involve, are advantages of
the value of which, to any person who may be selected for the duties in
question, Mr. Loch is deeply sensible.

Your observations on the expediency of attaching a higher salary to the
office than that now appropriated to it from the Education Fund, have
been perused by Mr. Loch with every attention. But while he feels the
force of your reasons, and the weight due to your opinion, he would not
consider himself justified in proposing to the Court the adoption of the
measure which you recommend, until trial shall have been made of the
possibility of procuring a competent person on the terms originally
proposed. He will therefore feel greatly indebted to you if you will
endeavour to obtain a person qualified for the office, and willing to
undertake it on the present conditions. Should this be found
impracticable, it will no doubt be advisable for the Court to take into
consideration the expediency of increasing the Salary.

I have the honor to be, Sir
 Your most obedient Servant

Edition: current; Page: [25]
On the subject of the Board’s alteration in the reply to Bengal Pol P.C.
1308,3 (concerning the Boondela chiefs & jageerdars) as the Chairman4
has not adopted the passage which you have inserted, I may take this
opportunity of mentioning why. No 49 in the classified list annexed to
the H. of C. Report,5 viz the Nana of Calpee, is the chief of Jaloun, he
is no longer called Nana of Calpee because Calpee has been ceded to the
British Govt. No 52 is probably Kishore Sing of Punnah. The others who
are referred to in the Board’s insertion (most of whom appear to be of
the Chobey family) are entirely insignificant. The Chairman has often
seen them when he was in Bundlecund and says they are petty Jageerdars
of no sort of consequence, and their engagements are not treaties but
are constituted by Sunnuds on our part, & acknowledgments of allegiance
on theirs.

You will find that we have made several additions to this PC since it
returned to us. We find that it saves much time & trouble to continue
the subjects up to the latest advices.

Some months ago, by the desire of the then Chairman,2 I had the honour
of placing myself in communication with you with a view to obtain your
valuable aid in procuring a person qualified to superintend the Anglo
Indian College & to be the principal teacher in that Institution, and
you kindly consented to look out for a fit person. The Managers of the
Institution have since withdrawn their application, stating that they
have now no doubt of being able to select a competent person in India
and I am consequently directed by the Revenue & Judicial Committee to
apprise you that any further continuance of your endeavours to procure a
person in this country will be unnecessary.

Having thus fulfilled my instructions, permit me in my individual
capacity to say how much pleasure I have derived from your letter in
this month’s Asiatic Journal.3 The Government of India in their recent
conduct have gone directly in the teeth of the instructions they have
received from this country—as well as violated the most obvious rules of
policy & common prudence.

You have heard I suppose from Bickersteth all the circumstances

My dear Sir

In the PC herewith forwarded on the subject of Baroda affairs, you will
find that orders are given for the removal of Mr Williams from the
Office of the Commissioner & Resident.2 Similar Orders were inserted by
the Board in the P.C. recently returned on the subject of Myhee
Caunta—but the Chairman did not think that so good an occasion as the
present one & consequently the P.C. has been laid before the Committee
recently as it originally stood. It seems more just & less embarrassing
in its consequences to remove Mr Williams for general unfitness as
Edition: current; Page: [34] proved by the general state of affairs at
the Court to which he is accredited, than for specific instances of
misconduct of which his superiors (the Bombay Government of the time)
must share the blame & which the home authorities when they first
animadverted on them, did not deem worthy of so serious a punishment,
for you will observe that the misconduct of Mr Williams in regard to the
Myhee Caunta was as fully known to the Court when they sent out their
last dispatch on that subject as it is now.

The Board have also inserted in the PC on the Myhee Caunta, an order for
the removal of Mr Erskine from Kattywar.3 This seems very severe
treatment for an error of judgment which in him was comparatively
venial. He had never since he was in India been under any proper
superintendance; his superior was Mr Williams, who, as well as the
Government to whom they naturally looked for instructions, for years
countenanced & approved all he did. If this does not render an error of
judgment excusable, would it not at least be hard to ruin the entire
prospects of a young man for errors committed under such circumstances.

I trouble you with this to explain the reason why the alterations have
not been adopted.

My dear Sir

With reference to Political Draft No 487, in which the Board have
inserted a paragraph they inserted before in the PC, relating to the
inexpediency of including a multiplicity of subjects in the same
letter—the Court I dare say will not make any remonstrance—but the
reason why the paragraph was struck out, was, that the substance of it
was embodied in an additional paragraph to a previous P.C. & thereby
reached India earlier than it would have done if left in the P.C. in
which the Board originally inserted it. With reference to the subject
generally it seems to me very important that any instructions given to
the Govt of India to matters in their separate letters, they should be
warned at the same time not to discontinue the Edition: current; Page:
[35] practice of sending quarterly General letters embracing all
subjects not already reported on separately. The necessity of this
appears from the conduct of the Bombay Government which ever since it
has written none but separate letters has made a practice of having a
great part of its proceedings unreported for years together & obliging
us occasionally to take up subjects from the Consultations alone. The
natural tendency of the system of separate letters seems to be to
leaving subjects unnoticed until either some grave event happens, or a
considerable quantity of matters has accumulated or the attention of
Govt or the Court is drawn to the fact that there has been no report for
a long time & the only check to this tendency seems to be making
obligatory on somebody to look through a whole quarter’s or half year’s
proceedings & report everything of any moment.

If you should agree in these views you will no doubt use your influence
with the Board in support of them. As it is, we are writing as often &
as vigorously to Bombay to demand General letters, as to Bengal to do
what looks very like demanding their discontinuance or at least might
admit of that interpretation.

Believe me. My dear Sir
 Most truly yours

The paragraphs respecting Col. Alves2 were omitted in the Draft to which
you allude, because the Committee considered that the only reason for
releasing the other Madras officers from the retrenchment,3 was its
being retrospective & that if an officer had been retrenched without
hardship of a refund, and in obedience to Edition: current; Page: [37]
the regulations of the service he had no claim to the restoration of the
money. If the money were repaid to Col. Alves, the Committee thought
that the Bengal officers would ask for it & on the whole it appeared to
them that if Col. Alves thought himself aggrieved he would memorialize
the Govt or the Court & the question might then be decided with a
knowledge of the sentiments of the Govt.

These, as far as I could collect from the discussions in Committee, were
the reasons which led to striking out the paragraph respecting Col.
Alves.

From a PC herewith forwarded on the Affairs of Oude, you will perceive
that the death of the King of that country2 has not, in the opinion of
the Chairs,3 obviated the necessity of taking into consideration the
great principles of general policy laid down in the Resolutions of Govt
which contemplated the removal of that prince from the throne.

It was to these general principles only, that any allusion was intended
in the Hyderabad P.C. & the Chairman, with reference to the nature of
the paragraphs now submitted, does not see any necessity for the
remodelling of the concluding part of the Hyderabad paragraphs. If the
President4 after reading the Oude P.C. should continue of his former
opinion I should be much obliged to you if you would suggest to me the
sort of modification which would best meet the President’s views. In the
mean time the Hyderabad paragraphs will be kept in abeyance.

With reference to your note of the 31st ulto, I have caused search to be

can exist. The great amount of crime in our own territories the authors
of which find refuge in the Guicowar’s, will appear from the Collection
to the P.C. in the affairs of the Guicowar, herewith sent.

I am also directed by the Chairman3 to call your attention to the
observations respecting Mr Williams,4 (to a similar effect with those
inserted by the Board in Draft 50) which are contained in the present
P.C. 2095 & which were reserved for it instead of being put into Draft
50, because when the original P.C. was divided & the portions of it
which related to the general government separated from those which
touched upon special points, the remarks on Mr Williams’ conduct seemed
to belong rather to the former division. This is still the view
entertained by the Chairs, & they are on that account, desirous that the
insertion in Draft 50 may be withdrawn, for which an application will
probably be made in the regular form.

Can you give me any idea whether P.C. 2133, sent to the Board on the

subsequent Agra P.C.s have been returned, which being full of references
to P.C. 2133 are kept waiting by it, I would venture to suggest that in
case any point or points should require prolonged consideration or are
likely to give rise to correspondence, the paras relating to them might
perhaps be detached & made into a separate P.C. & the rest proceeded
with. I wish the same course had been adopted in this office respecting
Draft 3, one point of which (that relating to the tomb of the Persian

I received your two letters both together today, not from any negligence
of mine in asking for them, but from the carelessness of the Post office
people in telling me there was nothing for me. Many thanks for the
trouble you have taken. The packet containing the first part of the
report2 is not worth paying 12½ piastres for, or one piastre, as I have
already seen the whole document here in a newspaper, & can have as many
copies of it as I like in England, where alone they can be of any use,
therefore pray do not trouble yourself any further about the packet. I
will give the 17 carlini3 to Sterling or to somebody else who may be
going to Naples, as there appears to be some fear that Dr Calvert’s4
health may prevent Sterling from going there—he will at any rate not
stay more than ten days, as he will set out if at all about the 1st of
April & return about the 15th with a brother of his who is bringing home
a sick wife from Corfu.5 Your messages shall be given to him. I believe
he knows Severn—Wolff6 I have not heard him speak about.

The two other parts of the Report reached me duly. I am really concerned
that you have had so much more trouble about a matter of such small
consequence, than I expected, or than I should ever have dreamed of
imposing upon you.

Edition: current; Page: [44]
One of the letters which you forwarded tells me what you probably have
heard from your brother direct, that the whole edition of his History is
sold, except a few copies.7 He was well & in spirits.

I have attended to your advice about riding, but have not found it
possible to ride so much or so often as I intended, on account of a pain
in my side which invariably comes on after I have ridden a very short
time. I do not find myself at all better, or getting better, & have
renounced the hope of any considerable benefit from this journey or
climate. I still adhere to my macaroni diet which I find as pleasant &
as least as wholesome as any other.

Pray command my services to the utmost for anything you may wish done

thought of Sicily.

Your very kind letter increases my mistification at what has happened.

Edition: current; Page: [45]
I was aware that you valued the book highly as a gift from a friend, &
as not easy to be replaced; but I was quite unaware that it was (or that
as a Prospectus of an unpublished work it was likely to be) in such
request or of such value in the market, as could make it an object with
any one to become possessed of it by dishonest means.2

I have no clue whatever to trace it by, but if you would have the
kindness to give me the exact title, I will set my bookseller to look
out for it. I fear there is little chance of success since whoever got
possession of it most probably desired to keep it rather than to sell
it—or if to sell it, intended to sell it immediately, having some
customer in view.

10th October 1839

My dear Sir

Perhaps a former slight acquaintance with you, which I always look back
to with pleasure, may be a sufficient excuse for my troubling you with
this note on a subject in which you also are interested though not so
directly as myself. I have been for some time engaged in carrying on a
review, from which various reasons now conspire to make me desirous of
disconnecting myself. Though its circulation is steady, it is not
sufficient to cover the expenses; & the deficit would be still greater
unless I were to continue devoting an amount of my own time & exertion
to the review which is not convenient to a person who has other
pursuits, & is not justified by any amount of good likely to be produced
in the existing state of the public mind by a person of my particular
cast of opinions & general mental qualifications, at least through the
channel of a periodical work. Now your review Edition: current; Page:
[46] has the same difficulties to struggle against, & if there are any
two reviews which more particularly stand in each other’s way it is the
British & Foreign & the London & Westminster. The proprietor of the
British & Foreign2 has shewn an honorable perseverance in carrying on a
review which cannot hitherto have been prosperous as a mere pecuniary
speculation, in which quality I should be very glad to imitate him if I
had his resources & his consequent means of obtaining the best help.

Now therefore what I should wish to know is, whether it is probable that
he would be willing to become a purchaser of the L. & W. & I prefer
asking your opinion on the matter in this way, because if you think that
he certainly or almost certainly would not, I should proceed no farther
in the business. I am aware of no one to whom the acquisition of the
review would be so advantageous, no one else indeed to whom in a
pecuniary sense there would be much likelihood of its being at all
advantageous, unless possibly to some bookseller as an instrument of
puffing & to such I should not chuse to be the means of consigning it.
Some one might perhaps be found who would undertake it from higher
motives & whose circumstances would enable him to be indifferent to the
very moderate pecuniary loss at present incurred. But I should very
willingly see it united to your review, since the only individualizing
character which it has possessed in all its avatars & which therefore it
ought not to part with, & live, is that of an organ of radicalism, & the
article on the State of the Nation, in your last number but one, rather
surpasses in point of radicalism, than falls short of, my limits.3

from it. I have not yet received any answer from Beaumont, but I cannot
be much longer without it: if I do not come to terms with him, I will
make up my mind once for all. I should like best, in that case, that
your schemes should proceed, with some other person than myself as the

cannot have adverted to the passages in the Collection, to which you

My dear Sir

On my return here2 your note of the 19th ulto respecting P.C. 2674 was
shewn to me.

The reasons for keeping the paragraphs respecting the Institution Fee in
the Political Department are, first, that the former correspondence on
the subject has been in that Department. Secondly that the question to
be at present decided is a Mysore question exclusively & it was not the
intention of the Chairs3 that the decision should be considered as
prejudging in any degree the question respecting the abolition of the
Institution Fee in our own territories—which would in some measure at
least apparently be the case if these paragraphs were sent to India in
the Legislative or Judicial Departments.

For my own part, believing that an Institution Fee is everywhere
objectionable & that the arguments in Cameron’s admirable report4 are
conclusive everywhere I should be happy to see the abolition made
general but the Court, at present, are certainly not prepared for such a
measure.

My dear Calvert

I have hitherto kept in view the physiological maxim inculcated in the
Edition: current; Page: [52] conclusion of your note to me, & I should
probably have allowed myself a few more days of gestation if I had not
wished to ask your opinion as to a certain matter. I had arranged with
the undertaker, McDowell,2 that the grave should be built up to a
certain height above the ground: that being done, an iron railing round
it would have been unnecessary & expensive.3 On the very morning of the
funeral McDowell informed me that the rector would not allow the grave
to be built up as high as we had intended—& when I saw it, I found the
gravestone quite on a level with the surface of the earth. Had I known
this previously I would have had an upright, not a flat gravestone: but
the mischief being done, I wrote to McDowell to express my wish to erect
an iron railing round the grave, to which he replies that the rector
objects to that too, & he recommends my writing to Mr Coope
himself.4—Now it is on this that I wish to ask your advice, viz. as this
Coope seems a queer customer, whether there is any use in applying to
him at all & if so, what is the best mode of doing so—whether directly
by letter, or in any more circuitous mode: & whether any of my friends
at Falmouth would be likely to mend the matter by interesting themselves
in it.

We are again all assembled here, & all tolerably well. I have written
once to Sterling since I arrived,5 but have not heard from him, as
indeed I did not expect. I have a “pretty considerable” quantity of
business on my hands here at present & my head is rather confused, which
must account for my writing so trumpery a letter—

TO JOHN MITCHINSON CALVERT1

1st May 1840

My dear Calvert

First, let me thank you for taking so much trouble about the affair with
Coope.2 We have finally determined that the thing had better remain as
it is; although McDowell is much to blame for having told me positively
that the matter could be arranged as we at first ordered it; but for
which assurance, I should have chosen one of the numerous other spots in
the burial ground the choice of which he offered me & in respect to some
of which the objection derived from the necessity of passing over the
place to get beyond it would not have had existence. But it is too late
to remedy this now. A headstone would be absurd unless for the purpose
of an inscription; & an inscription twice over would be almost equally
so.

Sterling is here, as you know, & I have seen as much of him as his
engagements allowed. We do not think he is so well as when he was at
Falmouth, but there seems no decided change for the worse. He still
coughs more than one likes to see. I dined along with him on Tuesday,
with the Sterling Club,3 where I saw for the first time your friends
Samuel and Robert Wilberforce,4—with whom, especially the latter,
Sterling had a controversy touching the purposes of Christianity, the
essential Christianship of whosoever acknowledges in Christ the
model-man, & the bad effect upon most minds of dwelling more upon any
set of means than upon the end, viz. individual holiness, very beautiful
to hear, & very edifying to the rest of us, & to me particularly
valuable as helping me to a clearer knowledge of what is in such minds
as those of the Wilberforces on such subjects. This discussion went off
into one as to whether philosophy tended—or should tend to make men
believe more, or less, W. maintaining the former & S. the latter view;
the Wilberforces both contending that philosophy enables one to give
credit not only to all the Bible miracles but to a considerable
scantling of the legends of saints & even of the Pagan prodigies
besides.

You said in one of your letters to me, that Sterling’s departure & mine
had closed your philosophical season. I might almost say that the loss
of Sterling & you had suspended mine, for till now when I have him again
for a few days I have Edition: current; Page: [54] thought but little on
any of the topics on which we used to converse. I have indeed written no
small number of pages on subjects of great importance viz. the “affairs
of the Guicowar” and the “disputes between the Rao of Cutch and certain
Wagur chiefs”5—with one considerable advantage over the more speculative
topics which I have sometimes written about, that I can foresee much
more exactly the effects with which my lucubrations will be attended. It
would be vastly more agreeable if in writing on Bentham or Coleridge to
a host of review readers6 one could adopt the “Do this” style, with a
prospect of being obeyed. (At this crisis I have made a great blot lower
down the page, which I hope you will impute to the liveliness of my
feelings.) My evenings have been employed in the tedious task of
revising old review articles for republication7—taking the sharpness, or
rather tartness, out of some of them, & alas! sacrificing some splendid
passages because I find they are ignorant nonsense! but what goes to my
heart most of all is, spoiling the music of some of my most rhythmical
periods by the painful necessity of substituting one foot of truth for
two of error or exaggeration: while the feelings which inspired the
sentences being clean gone, any attempt to re-modulate them would only
give rise to choice specimens of lumbering affectation. But as Swift
would say, “as the old saying is, an ounce of sense is better than a
pound of sound.”8

A propos of review articles, if it comes in your way do read Stephen’s
review (in the last Edinburgh) of the writings of Isaac Taylor of Ongar,
author of the “Natural History of Enthusiasm.”9 It is in great part made
up of two verae historiae, viz. first a supposed Biography of the
author, written twenty years hence, & next a supposed Autobiography by
him, relating the particulars of his posthumous existence, & how he gets
on in the sun, which it appears is to be the scene of our Edition:
current; Page: [55] next stage of existence. Our souls no doubt continue
to gravitate, while the centrifugal force perishes with our material
integuments.

Sterling tells me you have been seen to eat “a potatoe”—if that is the
cause of your not being in force, those are right who say that potatoes
are poison, as is natural to the plants of the genus Solanum, natural
family Solanaceae &c. &c.10 I presume you add to your potatoe what
Carlyle speaks of as “an unknown condiment named Point.”11 If you go to
Penzance pray go to Lemorna Cove, the Logan stone, the Land’s End, & St
Just & pray do not go to Kynance, for I do not want to be the only
person who has not been there. It will be very pleasant to see you in
town.

My dear Sir

In the Political PC 2695 which either has been or will immediately be
sent to you from the Court in the official form, you will find two
material variations from the paragraphs which were originally sent to
you. One is on the subject of the proposed reform of the Jyepore Army by
the substitution for the greater part of it of a force under British
officers:2 this the Court are disposed to encourage provided it can be
done without an abuse of our superior power; & on the whole I may say
the Court are much more favourable than they had been until recently to
Lord Auckland’s view on the subject of bringing the armies of the native
states under our control as Edition: current; Page: [56] opportunities
offer,3 provided we avoid what would have been the effect of the
proposed Oude Treaty viz. to make a prince pay a second time for what he
had paid the full value for already.

The second alteration is in the paragraph respecting a misstatement by
Moosherraf Begum of Joura affecting the character of Major Borthwick.4 I
enclose Copy of a Memorandum by Sir H. Willock,5 concurred in by Mr
Edmonstone, which will explain to you the reason of the alteration or
rather omission in this instance.

required.

While I am writing I will say one word respecting the Board’s addition
to paragraph 64 of PC 2810, respecting the Bhonsla’s villages in the
Nizam’s country.3 It strikes me that the plan suggested by the Board
would never answer. We could manage the villages of a native prince &
pay over the revenues to him, because he can trust us—besides he must.
But they never trust one another, & there is no instance among them I
believe of a joint property in which the agents of both sharers do not
exercise a right of joint management. It must end therefore in our
managing the villages for both governments; which neither would like.

Would it not be better to refer to the Govt of India as a general
question, the possibility of negotiating an arrangement by which the
double Revenue agency might be avoided?

With reference to the India Political P.C. 2810, & to the paragraphs in
it which relate to the Bhonsla’s Deshmooky rights in the Nizam’s
territory;2 in addition to the remarks which I took the liberty of
privately communicating to you on the subject of the proposed
commutation of those rights, it may be added that no such commutation
could possibly satisfy the Nagpore Raja.3 It is not the money, but the
tenure, as an ancient family possession, that he is solicitous about; &
no money grant would compensate for the cession of a privilege venerated
for its antiquity.

There is another alteration made by the Board in the same P.C. which
appears founded on a misapprehension; I allude to the subject of the
Title offered by Shah Edition: current; Page: [61] Shooja to Sir C.
Wade4 which it would seem the Board conceive to be of the nature of
those honours which can only be accepted by express permission of the
Sovereign. This applies to Orders, Decorations etc but not to Titles,
which have been very often conferred upon Company’s Servants without any
other mention than that of their own Government at Calcutta. The King of

the organ of communication with him, a something ool Moolk or ood Dowla

be that mentioned by Capt Lang5 in p. 34 of the Colln, which is of a

My dear Sir

I answer your questions respecting Draft 356 under considerable
disadvantages from not having the Collection to refer to. But I think I
can answer them tolerably correctly.

The reason why I draw a distinction between the Myhee Caunta division &
the other ceded possessions is that Capt. Carnac then Rest at Baroda who
negotiated the treaty2 says expressly in his letter of 16th August 18173
“The cession does not include any part of the dues from the Myhee Caunta
division including Pahlunpore & Ballasmore which remain with the
Guicowar under his accession to the late Treaty with H.H. the Paishwa.”4
The Ghans Dana from the M.C. division must therefore be deemed to have
been distinctly & purposely withheld from us. It appears however that
under the Partition Treaty between the Guicowar & the Peshwa the G.
never had really any right to this Ghans Dana & therefore his not
waiving a claim which was never well grounded, did not constitute any
reason for our paying him the exactions in question. Still, we have paid
them & are therefore estopped from disputing the right.

But in regard to the other ceded possessions the G. did not himself
claim to have any right to Ghans Dana subsequently to the Treaty, & if
he had any clearly alienated it in our favour by the Treaty. If
therefore we had ever paid Ghans Dana (which we did not) it would be no
disputable point but a manifest oversight & would not therefore, I
conceive, have been binding upon us after we found out that he had
expressly renounced the claim.

My dear Sir

With reference to Mr Stark’s letter to me on the subject of PC 41942
(respecting the proposed Pension Fund for the Nizam’s local officers) it
seems to me there is a misapprehension respecting the nature of the
proposition which is now before the Court.

There will not, in the present plan, be any annual subscriptions from
the Edition: current; Page: [68] officers, no more than there are to the
Civil Annuity Fund in Bengal,3 which is the model that has been followed
in the proposed arrangements. The fund will be formed by the Nizam’s
annual contribution & its interest, together with the payment which each
officer will make on accepting the annuity viz one half its computed
value.

In reality the plan is simply one by which the Nizam’s Govt would grant
pensions to the local officers, not gratuitously but on payment of one
half their value4 computed at 9 per cent interest which is a very low
rate compared with that which the Nizam’s Govt habitually pays:5 & even
at that rate it could only cost the Nizam (according to the McGriffith
Davies calculations) a few hundred rupees a year over & above the 12000
RS which his Govt has already expressed willingness to pay.6

I apprehend that there would be in the nature of the case an implied
guarantee on the part of the British Govt to the intent, that if the
Nizam promised this boon to the officers he would not afterwards break
his promise without a breach of faith with us. But the engagement would
be so little onerous that there would be small temptation to break it.7

I accept very thankfully the additional time which you give me.2

Masson is I think a young man of great promise & even the faults of his
stile are not of a discouraging kind—but he is not yet out of his
apprenticeship. If you return his article I will offer to edite it for
him & make it if possible admissible.3

I have some, but a very slight knowledge of Thommerel,4 but I do not
know where he is to be found at present. Four years ago his address at
Paris was 34 Rue des Postes.

TO JOHN AUSTIN1

Tuesday*

My dear Austin

After my interview with you I have never felt much doubt as to what
Kindersley’s2 opinion would be; but I should like to know why the
Interest is fixed at 4 per Cent, a rate which certainly cd not have been
obtained in the 3 per cents, since it implies their price to be 75. When
as you are aware they have been during the whole period varying only
from about 90 to 100, their present price.

It is necessary also to determine how the Interest is to be calculated.
Is it to be made up to the end of each year & added to the principal,
i.e. is compound Interest to be given? or, is Interest to be charged
upon each item from the date of its receipt? Is a balance in hand to be
allowed &c. &c.

Yours ever

TO THOMAS STORY SPEDDING1

31st August 1848

Dear Sir

I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your pamphlet on the Poor Laws, & of
the very flattering letter which accompanied it.2 I am much gratified
that you should have found in my Political Economy, or in my other
writings, anything which appeared to you to deserve being so spoken of.

Your pamphlet, and particularly the concluding letter of the series,
contains much in which I heartily concur, & which I think likely to be
very useful.3 Of all contained in it, the thing which seems to me
especially valuable is the strong recognition of the very early & very
low state of advancement in which civilized society now is, compared
with what may one day be realized, & may already be reasonably aimed at.
It is probable that a greater amount of alteration in existing opinions
& institutions, than you contemplate, would be included in my idea of
Edition: current; Page: [75] this possible & desirable improvement; but
I am happy to find that we completely agree in thinking that neither
individuals nor classes can expect permanently to retain any power or
influence except by taking a lead in promoting this great object.

On the more especial subject of the pamphlet, I sympathize entirely in
the feelings which make you desire that the conditions of relief should
be made less onerous to those who wish to maintain themselves, but
cannot, than to those who can, but will not.4 But in regard to the
ablebodied I can see at present no means of sifting the one class from
the other, except by making the conditions such that no one will accept
relief who can possibly do without it. I suspect that the present poor
law is the best possible, as a mere poor law; that any nearer approach
to abstract justice is not to be had in a poor law, & must wait for a
revision of social arrangements more fundamental than poor laws. I think
it likely that society will ultimately take the increase of the human
race under a more direct controul than is consistent with present ideas;
in which case an unlimited “droit au travail”5 for all who are born, as
well as many other things, would not be the chimeras which they seem to
be in the present state of opinion & feeling.

I am, Dear Sir
 Yours faithfully

In Maclean’s Case, the Chairman thinks that the course which the Court
have taken, is a middle course—in as much as Mr Maclean’s position in
being compelled to resign, and retire with disgrace, although not a rich
but a ruined man, is very different from that of a servant retiring on
an independence at his own choice. The annuity, if he gets it, will, I
fancy, benefit nobody but his creditors. No other middle course seemed
possible, except to dismiss him, and give him a pension from the
Court—which could not have been charged on the Annuity Fund, and this
was deemed objectionable.

Monsieur—

Votre lettre du 26 Octobre et votre Traité des opérations de banque2 me
sont parvenus à mon retour d’Italie, près de trois mois après leur
envoi. Veuillez n’attribuer qu’à cet absence le retard que j’ai mis à
témoigner mes remerciements à un écrivain que j’avais appris à connaître
et à estimer par ses nombreux articles dans le journal La République, et
qui a fait beaucoup d’honneur à mon Traité d’Ec. Pol. en s’occupant de
le traduire.3

C’est bien aujourdhui le temps de lire et de penser pendant qu’il n’est
plus possible d’agir; et puisque le pays dont l’Europe attend des leçons
d’amélioration sociale se trouve momentanément frappé d’impuissance
pratique, il est à désirer que les bons esprits s’y occupent comme vous
de perfectionner les théories. Je trouve dans votre livre des vues très
éclairées sur le crédit. Vous en signalez bien sa véritable importance,
tandis que vous réduisez à une juste mesure les notions vagues et
exagérées sur sa puissance créatrice qui ont été la partie la plus
faible de plusieurs systèmes socialistes. Vous établissez ensuite
contrairement aux idées reçues la supériorité d’un régime de liberté. Il
y a bien quelques questions sur lesquelles je ne suis pas d’accord avec
vous, mais connaissant mon Ec. Pol. vous n’avez pas besoin que je vous
les indique du reste. Ce caractère en quelque sorte professionel de
votre ouvrage devant lui donner de nombreux lecteurs parmi les hommes
d’affaires, il me semble très propre à former une opinion publique
éclairée sur une classe d’intérêts très débattus aujourdhui et jusqu’ici
peu compris.

Agréez Monsr l’expression de ma plus haute considération amicale.

1845, requiring a report of the cases of such of the Extra Clerks and
Writers as are employed either on duties formerly discharged by
established clerks or on duties distinct from copying, I have the honor
respectfully to state that since the last report made by the Examiner on
the subject, dated the 9th June 1845, Mr Charles Bell and Mr Frederick
Charles Danvers have been employed in the manner above specified, the
former in the Judicial Department since the year 1847; and the latter in
the Public and Public Works Departments since the year 1853;2 and I
respectfully request that the employment of Messrs Bell and Danvers as
now reported, may be sanctioned by the Honorable Committee.

I have the honor to be, Honorable Sirs,
 Your most faithful and obedient Servant

9th September 1856

Secret.

Sir,

I have laid before the Secret Committee of the Court of Directors2 Mr
Danby Seymour’s letter of the 20th ultimo,3 with its enclosure from the
Under Secretary of State for the Foreign Department,4 communicating the
modified proposal of the Edition: current; Page: [88] French Government,
of which Captain Pigeard is the bearer,5 with respect to exchanges of
territory in India; and desiring to be informed of the opinion of the
Secret Committee on that proposal.

The arrangement which was understood to have been accepted by the French
Government in 18556 provided for the cession of all the French
possessions in India except Pondicherry, as well as of such part of the
territory attached to that settlement as lies outside a certain proposed
boundary; Her Majesty making over to France all British territory lying
within that boundary, and the nation which should be a gainer in revenue
by the double transfer making to the other a pecuniary compensation
calculated at twenty years purchase.

The French Government now disavows the assent which it was supposed to
have been given to this arrangement, and desires to limit its cessions
to the Pondicherry villages outside the proposed boundary, together with
the settlements of Chandernagore and Yanoon, and the French
Establishments at Calicut and Masulipatam; retaining the valuable
possessions of Maké and Karical, and the factories at Surat, Patna,
Cossimbazar, Dacca, Balasore and Jugdea. And these more limited
transfers the French Government proposes that Her Majesty should receive
as a full equivalent for the cession of the British territory within the
proposed Pondicherry boundary, no pecuniary compensation being made
payable as in the former Draft from the gaining to the losing nation.

As a reason for omitting this last stipulation, it is affirmed by
Captain Pigeard that the possessions which the French Government
proposes to cede would be worth more to the British Government than the
amount of the revenue which those possessions at present yield to
France. While the Secret Committee admit that to a certain, though a
moderate extent, this estimate may be well founded, they must observe
that the French Government also would derive from the acquisition of
villages inconveniently intermixed with its territory a benefit far
exceeding the mere revenues of those villages: and it appears from Lord
Cowley’s letter to Lord J. Russell dated 31st January 1852,7 that the
French Colonial Minister at that time8 even expressed his willingness
“to accept less than he gives, because he shall receive a compensation
in the suppression of the expenses of the French outlying
establishments.”

The Committee consider the question of an interchange of Indian
possessions to be one which is more important to French than to British
interests. Nevertheless, Edition: current; Page: [89] and although the
French Government withdraws the most valuable part of the cessions
originally contemplated, the opinion of the Committee is in favor of
accepting those which are now offered, if the French Government will
consent to receive in exchange territories of equivalent pecuniary value
in the neighbourhood of Pondicherry; but the Committee are decidedly
adverse to purchasing those transfers by cessions of greater value,
because they do not consider the acquisition as of sufficient political
importance to be worth any sacrifice of revenue; and also because by
making over to France all the territory which she desires for the
consolidation of her Pondicherry possessions and the rectification of
her boundary, the British Government would lose the power of hereafter
offering an equivalent likely to be accepted for the cessions, formerly
contemplated, but now withheld.

I am, Sir,
 Your obedient servant,

Honorable Sirs,

I have the honor to lay before you a letter from Mr Waud, the Registrar,
enclosing a Petition to your Honorable Committee from the four
Messengers attached to the Registrar’s Department (Henry Thomas Drew,
James Tarrant, John Lee Turner, and Edwin Norris) praying to be granted
a gratuity to remunerate them for the extra-work imposed on them by the
recent re-arrangement of a considerable portion of the Company’s
Records, together with the expenses they have incurred. Mr Waud bears
testimony to the severe labour entailed on the Petitioners, to the
extra-time during which they have been employed, to the extra expenses
entailed on them, to the strenuous exertions made by each man to assist
in carrying out the arrangement, and recommends the prayer of the
Petitioners to favorable consideration.

I beg leave respectfully to support the recommendations of Mr Waud, and
humbly submit that the indulgences solicited may be granted to the
Petitioners.

Sir,

I have had the honor to receive and lay before the Secret Committee your
letter dated the 10th instant,2 transmitting for any observations which
the Committee might desire to make, a copy of a letter in which the
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs3 expresses the opinion of Her
Majesty’s Government that it might be advisable to take possession of
Mohummerah for the purpose of increasing the pressure upon Persia.4

Since receiving your letter the Secret Committee have endeavored to
procure the best information within their reach bearing on the question
therein adverted to. The information which they have been enabled to
obtain is comprised in the following documents, copies of which I have
the honor to annex.

A Memorandum by Lieutenant Colonel Hennell, formerly Resident in the
Persian Gulf.5

A Chart of the Korun river prepared from actual Survey by Lieutenant
W.B. Selby of the Indian Navy,6 and transmitted to this country by the
Bombay Government as an inclosure in their letter to the Secret
Committee dated 10th June (No. 45) 1845.

A Memorandum by Sir W.F. Williams of Kars, Bart.7 who as Commissioner
for the settlement of the boundary between Turkey and Persia, resided
for a considerable time at Mohummerah and in its vicinity.

Having thus put the Board and through them Her Majesty’s Government in
possession of all the information they themselves possess, the Committee
refrain from expressing any opinion on the course which it may be most
expedient to adopt.

As connected with Lieutenant Colonel Hennell’s Memorandum I am directed
to transmit two copies of a Sketch made by that Officer from Memory, of

Sir,

In reply to Sir George Clerk’s letter of the 14th instant,2 requesting
the opinion of the Secret Committee on a modified proposal of
territorial exchanges with the French Government,3 I am directed by the
Secret Committee to state that they are not in possession of information
enabling them to judge to what extent the financial result of the
territorial arrangement in question would differ from that of the
arrangements formerly contemplated. As far however as the Committee
possess the means of forming an opinion, they are disposed to think that
the unreserved relinquishment of all the French possessions in India
with the exception of Pondicherry and its districts, would be an object
worth purchasing by the cession to France of the additional territory
near Pondicherry, included within the widest of the boundary lines
marked in the Map; which according to the desire of the Board is
returned herewith.

Secret.

Sir,

I have laid before the Secret Committee your letter of the 21st instant2
Edition: current; Page: [95] requesting to be informed whether the
Committee would object to a proposal considered likely to be made by the
French Government, that the value of the addition to be made to the
district round Pondicherry shall be one eighth or one sixth of the value
of the addition which would have been made to that district under the
Convention formerly proposed to France.3

I am directed by the Committee to observe in reply that the annual
revenue of the British Villages which would have been ceded to France by
the Convention formerly proposed was (as pointed out in their letter of
27th June 1855)4 Rupees 1,30,485.9.3 but that the Committee were not
then, and are not now acquainted with the value of the French Villages
which, by the same Convention would have been ceded to Great Britain.
Unless that value be such as to be a considerable set off against the
large amount of revenue which it was proposed to cede, the Committee are
disposed to think that the addition of one sixth, or even of one eighth,
to the cession, would render very doubtful the expediency, in a
financial point of view, of the exchange.

The Committee moreover are disinclined to extend any farther the area
laid down in the last proposal of the French Agent, as shewn in the Map.

TO THE FINANCE AND HOME COMMITTEE1

Examiner’s Office

13 January 1857

Honorable Sirs,

Your Honorable Committee is aware that systematic arrangements are now
in force under all or most of the Indian Governments for the destruction
of useless records. I venture to suggest that a similar arrangement is
highly desirable with regard to that portion of the records of this
office which consists of Duplicate Collections.

The transmission of Collections from India commenced in 1831, and they
have always been transmitted in duplicate: one copy of each Collection,
after their subjects have been disposed of by Despatches to India,
remaining with the Board of Commissioners. The duplicate Collections are
very serviceable until the arrival of the Books of Consultations, which
are often considerably in arrear. They are also useful, though in a less
degree, for some time longer, by saving the trouble of searching the
Indexes, or the delay of borrowing the original Collections from the
Board. But after a certain lapse of time, references to them become
infrequent, and while their rapidly increasing mass is an encumbrance to
the office, they answer no useful purpose except occasionally to save
the delay and expense of transcription when papers of old date are
required for the Honorable Court of Proprietors, or called for by the
Houses of Parliament.

I beg therefore to propose that measures be taken for the destruction,
(with the exception to be presently stated) of all duplicate Collections
bearing an earlier date than that of the 1st January 1852; and that
hereafter, at the end of each year one year’s duplicate Collections be
disposed of in a similar manner so that only those of the five years
last expired may at any time remain.

The only exception which it seems necessary to make from this
destruction, is in the case of papers which may appear likely to be
required at some future period by Parliament or the Proprietors: and I
recommend accordingly that the Chief Clerk in each of the several
Departments of this Office be directed to take such general cognizance
of the Collections previously to their destruction as may enable him
under instructions from the Examiner to select for preservation such of
them as may seem worth retaining for that use.

I have the honor to be, Honorable Sirs,
 Your most faithful and obedient Servant

TO THE FINANCE AND HOME COMMITTEE1

13th January 1857

Honorable Sirs,

In the early part of the present year, the Court was pleased to add one
to the number of the Assistants to the Examiner,2 in consequence of a
necessity created chiefly by the extraordinary growth of the business
devolving upon the Assistant in charge of the Public Department.

Since that time the Department has been divided into two branches, one
of which retains the original name, and the other is the Public Works
Department3 each being under the charge of a separate Assistant. No
addition however was at that time made to the number of Clerks in the
office, nor was any separation effected between the Clerks attached to
the two branches: and the business of both continues to be carried on by
the same Clerks who formed the Establishment of the Department before it
was divided.

I beg to represent to your Honorable Committee that the business which
had outgrown the powers of a single Assistant Examiner, equally exceeds
those of the number of Clerks which was sufficient under circumstances
entirely different from the present; and that in consequence,
notwithstanding the great efficiency of the gentlemen who conduct the
correspondence of the two Departments, the business of both still
remains considerably in arrears.

I therefore respectfully submit for consideration that such provision be
made for the increased business devolving on the Clerks in the
Departments, as your Honorable Committee may deem advisable. The
subjoined statement exhibits the present distribution of Clerks among
the several Departments of the office.

I have the honor to be, Honorable Sirs
 Your most faithful and obedient Servant

I am instructed by the Secret Committee to acknowledge your letter of

may wish to make, a copy of a letter from the Under Secretary of State
for the Colonies,3 requesting that a Vessel of the Indian Navy may be
sent to the Kooria Mooria Islands for the purpose of protecting the
persons to whom the Queen has granted permission to take Guano from
these islands.4

I am directed by the Committee to suggest in reply that the contents of
Brigadier Coghlan’s letter of the 19th of December last, No. 23, be
communicated to Mr. Labouchere.5

The Board is aware from that letter that in the opinion of the Officer
most likely to be well informed on the subject, the cession of these
Islands to Her Majesty by the Imaum of Muscat is a nullity,6 as they
were not his to dispose of. At all events, the beneficial enjoyment of
them, and of the Guano produced in them, has resided from time
immemorial in the Arabs of the Coast; whose rights whether acknowledged
or not, it would, the Committee submit, be neither politic nor just to
overrule by force, while Brigadier Coghlan appears to anticipate little
difficulty in obtaining an amicable cession of them.

I am directed to request attention to the injurious consequences which
the Brigadier predicts from any renewal of the attempt to take forcible
possession of these islands, and in conclusion I am desired to observe,
that the same causes which, in Mr Labouchere’s opinion, make it
inconvenient to employ one of Her Majesty’s Ships of War on the proposed
service, are applicable in an equal degree to the Indian Navy, and there
is every reason to believe that in consequence of the Edition: current;

I am commanded by the Secret Committee to acknowledge the receipt of Mr
Waterfield’s letter of the 22nd instant,2 forwarding for their
consideration, copies of certain documents on the subject of the
stipulations to be made with the Shah of Persia at the cessation of the
present hostilities.3

The only remarks which it appears necessary for the Committee to make
refer to the second Article of the proposed Commercial Treaty.4 It is
suggested by Sir Justin Sheil that there may be “in India various
commodities which are classed as contraband and the importation of which
is prohibited; such, perhaps, as Opium.”5 I am directed to state that
there are no prohibitions of the description referred to in the Customs
laws of British India, and that it does not therefore seem requisite, on
that account, to modify the language of the Article in question, in the
manner proposed in the letter from the Committee of Privy Council for
Trade, dated the 22nd instant.

The Secret Committee concur in the view taken by the Lords of the
Committee for Trade in respect to the omission from the same Article of
the word “European,” as applied to the “most favored nation,”—if such
omission would, as stated by Sir Justin Sheil, have the effect of
admitting goods imported into Persia by British Merchants at the lower
rate of 4 per cent, at which goods imported by Turkish traders are
admitted under Treaty; but the Committee are not aware why Turkey is
less to be regarded as a European power than Russia, both countries,
although Edition: current; Page: [102] possessing large territories in

Sir,

I have had the honor of receiving and laying before the Secret
Committee2 your Edition: current; Page: [103] letter of the 2nd
instant,3 enclosing a paper by Captain Pigeard4 conveying what the Board
consider the ultimatum of the French Government as to the contemplated
exchange of British and French possessions, and requesting the opinion
of the Committee on the expediency of accepting the proposition as
therein stated.

The present proposal differs from the one which immediately preceded it,
in relinquishing a triangular piece of land, (of the extent or value of
which the Committee have no information) which in the former proposal
formed part of the territory to be ceded by the British Government.

The Committee observe that in M. Pigeard’s paper, the cessions to be
made by France are stated to be Chandernagore, Yanoon and Maha, with the
factories of Masulipatam and Calicut, while M. Pigeard also states that
the French Establishments in India would be reduced to two; (viz
Pondicherry and Karical). M. Pigeard appears to overlook the possession
by France of several other factories, at Surat, Patna, Cossimbaza,
Dacca, Balasore and Jugdea, and possibly elsewhere. The Committee have
always regarded the relinquishment by France of all such outlying
possessions as a sine qua non of the proposed exchange.

Assuming that these factories are to be included in the cession, and
that the French possessions in India will really be limited to
Pondicherry and Karical, the Committee are of opinion that the proposal
made by M. Pigeard might be accepted provided that on a reference to the
Government of India no objection should be made to it by that authority.

The enclosures in your letter are herewith returned.

was examined by the Governor of Bombay5 in a Minute dated the 19th March
following. Lord Elphinstone for reasons which appear conclusive to the
Committee, considered every mode of accomplishing the object proposed by
Lieutenant Burton, inadmissible, except one which he described as
equivalent to “taking possession of the place”; and it is hardly
necessary to say that the Committee would consider any attempt to
establish a political, and as its necessary accompaniment, a Military
Station, on the African Coast, as in the highest degree objectionable.

I am commanded to add, that the Articles of Peace and Friendship
concluded with the Somalis in November 1856, and quoted in your letter,6
oppose an additional obstacle to the entertainment of the proposal. For
inasmuch as those Edition: current; Page: [105] Articles stipulate that
we shall have the power to send an Agent to reside at Berbera during the
fair, for the purpose of seeing that the provisions of the Agreement are
observed, they by necessary implication preclude us from maintaining an
Agent there at any other period, or for any other purpose.

The Committee, I am directed to add, entirely agree in the observation
of the Board respecting the impropriety of Lieutenant Burton’s conduct
in addressing to the Geographical Society criticisms on the political
measures of the Government of India.

 Your most obedient servant,

Honorable Sirs,

I have the honor to report the following circumstances which have
occurred in connection with John Whatmough a Messenger under the
Assistant Registrar in the Book Office2 attached to this Department.

Edition: current; Page: [106]
About six months since Whatmough, who was carrying a bundle, was stopped
by a Detective Officer at 6 o’Clock on a Sunday morning; and the bundle
being examined, was found to contain “old books torn up.” In
consequence, however, of the explanation Whatmough gave, the Officer
allowed him to “pass on.”

On Saturday the 1st of August, Whatmough was again met by the same
Detective who had met him on the former occasion. He had, on this
occasion, in his possession “a parcel wrapped up in brown paper.” Having
asserted that the paper was given to him by Mr Atkins, he was confronted
with that gentleman who denied the statement. He was thereon taken
before the sitting Magistrate at Guildhall, examined, and remanded.3 On
a subsequent occasion he was again brought up, and, on the re-hearing of
the charge against him, he was committed for trial at the ensuing
Sessions and is now awaiting his trial.

Dear Sir

On receiving your letter of the 30th September I made enquiry as to the
conditions of eligibility to the medical service of the East India
Company, and I regret to say that no foreigner can be admitted into it
unless he is first naturalized. I confess I do not see why this
restriction should exist in the medical service. In the civil and
military services there are obvious reasons for it. The restriction does
not exist in the educational service, and several of your countrymen
(among others a son of the great Liebig)2 are Professors in the
Government Colleges in India. If an appointment of that kind would suit
your friend’s3 qualifications and wishes, he might perhaps succeed in
obtaining one, as the education department is in a state of rapid
growth, and good teachers of science are continually wanted.

Accept our condolences on the loss of your father.4 We hope your
sister,5 who was ill when we last saw you, is now better. I am much
interested in what you say of your literary undertakings, and should be
glad to hear more about the philological articles you mention.6 Do they
contain the speculation you told me of, connecting Protagoras with the
authorship of one of the Hippocratic treatises?7 aI have nearly finished
an Essay “on Liberty” which I hope to publish next winter.8 As the
Liberty it treats of is moral and intellectual rather than political, it
is not so much needed in Germany as it is here.a

Honorable Sirs,

I have the honor to submit, for the favorable consideration of your
Honrble Committee, a Memorandum placed in my hands by Mr Prideaux,
Assistant Examiner of India Correspondence, bringing to notice the
Services rendered, in addition to those required from him in the
discharge of his ordinary Official Duty, by Mr William Peters, an
Established Clerk in the Revenue Department of this Office. Under an
Order of the House of Commons, he has been, for a considerable time,
employed in selecting from a vast mass of correspondence, documents
illustrative of the measures taken by the East India Company for
increasing the Edition: current; Page: [114] quantity or improving the
quality, of the supply of Cotton from India,2 for the use of
manufacturers in this Country.

In order that the Return to the requisition of the House of Commons
should be made as extensively useful as possible, to those who were
likely to consult it, Mr Peters has devoted much time and labour to the
arrangement, under distinct heads, of the matters treated of in the
papers; so as to render them easy of reference;—and he has, moreover,
carefully corrected the proof sheets, during their passage through the
Press.

I desire to add that I concur in Mr Prideaux’s testimony in favor of Mr
Peters.

aI bhave received your letter of the 21st,2 andb have been interested by
the information as to your papers in the Rhenish Museum.3 I was
disappointed however at your not saying anything of your historical work
on Greek philosophy,4 which I expect will be very valuable, not only by
throwing new light on historical points, of which there are always a
great number to be cleared up by any competent enquirer, but also by
exhibiting the speculations of the ancients from the point of view of
the experience philosophy, a thing hardly yet attempted, and least of
all in your country.

I have no objection to your annexing to the Logic any part of the
controversy with Whewell5 which you think likely to be useful. There are
not many defences extant of the ethics of utility, and I have sometimes
thought of reprinting this and other papers I have written on the same
as well as on other subjects.a6

We were glad to hear of the improvement in your sister’s health.7 With
regard to my own, which you kindly enquire about, there is nothing
alarming in it, but I require a long recruiting, not so much from work,
as from the confinement of an office, which has made it advisable for me
to decline the position offered me in the new government of India.8 I am

impossible to make anything of without a real capacity for these

satisfaction to a writer on any scientific subject to find such readers.
As to the particular point on which we differ,2 it makes, as you justly
remark, no difference in the result, as the conditions of the
international demand finally decide the terms of international exchange,
whatever may be the effect of the improvement in the first instance. But
I still think I was right, as the result of an improvement in any

with which I am Edition: current; Page: [118] not at present well
acquainted, and I have not access here to the sources of information.
The best paper I have seen on the subject was in the Journal of the
Statistical Society of Dublin, and was written by Mr Cairnes, the
Whately Professor of Pol. Economy at Dublin University.2 Perhaps he
might be induced to write again on the subject for Fraser.3

I thank you for the inclosures you sent which I was well pleased to see,
though none of them proved very important or interesting.

If you should think there is sufficient demand for the pamphlet to
warrant a second edition, I should like the part of the article in
Fraser which relates to Hare’s book, subjoined by way of Appendix.4 I
should not like simply to reprint the pamphlet as I wrote it before I
had seen Hare’s book; while it would be troublesome to recast it as
completely as would be necessary to incorporate Hare’s ideas. If you

knowing whether you have received the sheets of the little book, and in
case you have, whether you still have any idea of translating it. I
should much prefer you to any other translator who is likely to offer,
but I have always thought it probable that you might have good reasons
against undertaking it, and that some other part of Germany might be
more suitable for bringing the book3 before the German public. In
addition to an offer which was made through Messrs Parker, I have lately
received one under the signature of Eduard John, Justizrath, at
Marienwerdera in Prussia,4 bwhob writes like a competent person, and
chas sent me a portion of a translation actually executed; but as it is
in the German Manuscript character, which I do not read fluently, I am
not at present able to judge of its merits.c Do you know anything of
this gentleman, and would you advise me, in case the undertaking should
not suit yourself, to close with his offer?

preference to any other translator. I have no objection to the omission
of any part or the whole of the note to which you refer, nor of the
sentence binb page 9,3 though in the latter case I have not been able to
discover what there is which renders it more unsuitable for publication
than all the rest of the chapter. Perhapsa you think csome words in it
may be understood as a declaration against Kingly government, but
nothing of the sort was intended, nor did it occur to me that any one

free political institutions, and even that is but incidental. But I do
not think the retention of the sentence of any importance.c

Dear Sir

I am sorry to say I have mislaid the address you gave me, and I am
afraid this Edition: current; Page: [124] note may not reach you. If you
receive it, will you kindly let me know how to address you in future,
and in particular how to send you a copy of a volume I have just
published on Representative Government.2

I was much surprised a short time ago to learn from a review which was
sent to me, that a translation of the “Liberty” has been published in
Germany.3 I know nothing of the translator, who neither had, nor asked
for, any authority from me.

In the uncertainty whether what I write will reach you, I say no more at
present.

Dear Senior

As far as I have power over the paper by Tocqueville in the London and
Westminster (if I have any such power) I most willingly consent to its
being made use of in the manner you propose.2 I believe however it will
be found that the article, though in itself of very great interest, is
superseded by the volume “L’ancien régime et la révolution,”3 of which
it may be said to be, as far as it goes, the first draft.

If we could but have your volumes of Tocqueville’s conversations! Some
time or other, doubtless, they will be published.4

I am very desirous to read your book on Education, which I suppose is
the separate report Chadwick told me of, and I am glad it has the
dimensions of a book.5 Please send it, not here, but to Blackheath Park,
as I expect to be there early Edition: current; Page: [125] in June. My
full address here is Saint-Véran, près Avignon, Vaucluse, but your
letter came duly, though directed simply Avignon, France.

Dear Sir

About three months ago I published a volume on Representative Government
of which one of the first copies would have been sent to you, had I not
unfortunately forgotten and mislaid your address.2 I wrote to you from
Avignon a note directed only to Herr Theodor Gomperz, in Wien, on the
bare chance that it might reach you, but I suppose it did not. On
returning from the South I have for the first time been able to make a
regular search for the address you gave me, and have fortunately found
it. I have therefore directed my publisher to send you a copy without
delay.

I was vexed to find, from a German Review which was sent to me, that a
translation has been made into German, I know not by whom, of the little
volume on Liberty.3 Had my consent been asked, I should not have given
it, unless I had heard from you that you had abandoned the intention you
at one time had of translating the book. But as I made no reservation of
the right of translation, my consent was not necessary. Indeed I do not
even know that England has any convention on the subject with the German
States.

I should much like to hear from you respecting yourself, and your
literary and other doings and projects. I am Dear Sir

yours very truly

Dear Madam

I received your letter at this place, but the pamphlet you did me the
favour to send has not been forwarded, and I do not expect to see it
until I return to England.2 Edition: current; Page: [127] I therefore
suggest your making other arrangements for sending the pamphlets to Mr
Helps and Mr Buckle;3 neither can I, in general, undertake to forward
papers. I have read your letters in the Adelaide newspaper,4 and found
them a very clear and useful statement of Mr Hare’s plan and its merits.
You will be glad to hear, if you have not already heard it from himself,
that Mr Hare thinks very favourably of your pamphlet. It is much to be
desired that the attempt to bring the plan before your House of
Assembly, should be repeated.5 The question is sure to be advanced by
discussion. It is decidedly making progress in many other parts of the
world besides England and Australia.

I was not aware that, as you say, the association with my name is likely
to bring discredit on the plan in South Australia, and I am sorry to
hear that you think so: if it is so, however, you do judiciously to
avoid it. I suppose I am to understand the sentence in your letter which
includes giving the suffrage to women in the category of “absurdities”
as ironical.

have found its way to my Edition: current; Page: [128] publishers,
Messrs Parker, along with the letter, I am as yet ignorant even of its
subject. But I cannot doubt that one who expresses so strong an interest
in the memory of her whom I have lost, is a participator in her and my
opinions, at least on the one point which, with us both, was and is the
most fundamental of all. You ask for information respecting her. About
two years ago, in reprinting from the Westminster Review her article
headed “Enfranchisement of Women,” to be included with some of my own
writings in a collection entitled “Dissertations and Discussions,” I
prefixed a few paragraphs, containing what I felt prompted to say, and
as much as I thought suitable to be said, to those who were personally
strangers to her.3 Only those who knew her can appreciate how vain it
would be to attempt to convey in words an impression of a character so
rich and various as hers. It is the object of my life to express in my
writings as much as I can render of the thoughts and sentiments which
she inspired.

that I can have a day’s more proofs.3 Anything posted on Tuesday will
reach me before I start. And anything sent so as to be delivered here by

than the 9th if a letter, or the 8th if anything printed) will reach
Athens by a private hand, as soon as I shall myself. I should therefore
like the February Fraser to be sent here in the usual manner. The
separate copies may remain with you for the present, as I may perhaps
think of some more Edition: current; Page: [130] persons to whom I
should wish copies sent. Newspapers from Australia, and the Séances et
Travaux de l’Académie,4 may wait for the present.

notice. Any letters with “to be forwarded” written on them, I should
wish sent there. Any others may be sent here, to wait for my return. If
there is a book post to Athens, I should be obliged by your sending the
March and April numbers of Fraser by it: if not, please send them here
as usual.

Professor Villari, of the University of Pisa, a very valued friend of

information useful to Italy on the subject of public education. He is
particularly interested in the question of competitive examination,
which has been mooted in Italy also, with a practical object. The manner
in which you have laboured in that cause,3 and the inestimable
obligations which it owes to you, have emboldened me to think that an
opportunity of serving it further might be agreeable to you, and that I
might venture to give Mr Villari an introduction to you. You will find
him a highly favourable specimen of a country in which all liberal
Englishmen now feel so deep an interest; and there are, Edition:
current; Page: [131] I should think, few persons whose opinions on
Italian affairs are better worth having, as well as on many other
subjects. Among other writings of merit, Mr Villari is the author of an

Sept. 17. 1862

Dear Sir

aWe have now been more than a fortnight in this quiet harbour, after our
blongb journey, and are fully enjoying its peacefulness. We did not see
so much of the Alps as we expected after leaving Ischla: the ascent of
the Schaffberg the next day was very pleasant, but the rain which set in
on that very evening kept us three days within doors at Salzburg, and
then only intermitted long enough to enable us to see Edition: current;
Page: [132] Berchtesgaden and the Königsee, which came up to our highest
expectations. By the time we reached Gastein, the rain had come again,
and the place being quite full, we did not remain. Had we done so, we
could not have made a single excursion, so rainy did the weather become,
and we had no more fine weather, except one day at Innsbrück. What is
more, we have found rainy weather here also, which usually does not set
in till the latter half of October. cI am doing little at present but
reading up the French and English reviews. But since I arrived I have
written and sent off an article on the American question (à propos of Mr
Cairnes’ book) which will be in the Westminster Review next month.2 A
very interesting series of notes on America and on the war have been
published this summer in an English periodical (Macmillan’s Magazine)
and are, I see, lately reprinted as a volume, under the title of “Six
Months in the Federal States”: the author is a Mr Dicey, who had within
the last two years published a book on Rome and Italy.3 He writes very
judiciously, as well as with right feeling, on the whole subject, and
what he says respecting the people of the North, being evidently a
faithful transcript of what he has seen and heard, ought to have some
influence. The Times, as might be expected, is as bad as ever, and even
more undisguised in the expression of its bad wishes. It let out,
however, a curious admission the other day—that whatever might be in
other respects the issue of this war, it must lead to the destruction of
Slavery.4 This will be true if the North succeeds; but if the South
should be successful, I expect the very reverse. In Europe things appear
to be going on well, as far at least as mental progress is concerned.
This is very visible in the higher order of writers in France; among
whom I invariably remark that what is bad in thought or sentiment is
found chiefly in the publicists who had made themselves known before
1848, and that the dgeneral toned of those who have risen into notice
since that time is both higher in morality, and more philosophic ine
intellect. The Garibaldi affair is very painful, but it has ended as
little mischievously as perhaps it could have done.5 It has at least
given Louis Napoleon no pretext for intervention, Edition: current;
Page: [133] and less excuse than ever for keeping his troops in Rome;6
while Garibaldi, it is to be hoped, is still reserved for better times.
If it also destroys Rattazzi,7 that will be another benefit arising from
it.c

I have found Dr Schiel’s letter;8 it is dated Frankfurt. Let me hear
from you now and then.—fWith our compliments to your sister I am

yours very gtrulyg

J.S. Mill

P.S. I had written the preceding before I received yours.f We have, as
you see, arrived safely, and hI should have written before, had I
thought you would have felt any such anxiety as you mention on our
account.9 It will always be a pleasure to me to hear from you: let me
know what you are doing and thinking, and how the political affairs of
your country are proceeding. I can assure you that however little
expression I may habitually give to such a feeling you are one of the
few persons whose friendship I value, and whom I would gladly see
asserting an influence on the current of public affairs.h

in January, and thanking you Edition: current; Page: [134] as well for
the kind and friendly feelings shewn in your letter as for the very
interesting information contained in it. I am particularly glad of what
you have been doing on the subject of the Principle of Contradiction, as
I have commenced writing something2 to which a full understanding of
that subject is indispensable, and I do not feel that I have yet
thoroughly mastered it. Your account of Austrian politics is very
valuable, and I thank you for the American news, which, as you
anticipated, was entirely unknown to me. The paper giving an account of
my article in Fraser reached me duly.3 I am much gratified that you
thought the article worth so full an abstract even for Germany, though I
am almost ashamed of the very flattering terms in which you spoke of it
and of me.

I am very glad that you are so far advanced with the Logic, and I return
your paper of questions duly filled up. I am much interested also with

1. Will you kindly allow me to apply to you even now for such
information and advice, as I am unable to get from any other quarter and
also to signify this fact, the assistance given me by you both on the
title-page by calling the translation executed: Mit Genehmigung und
unter Mitwirkung,4 of the Author, and in the preface, where this
cooperation is to be more strictly defined and limited to what it really
is?

Certainly.

2. The fallacies of Simple Inspection5 have always been a stumbling
block to me, not the thing but the name you have chosen to designate
them. I had translated the words by “Trugschlüsse der einfachen
Wahrnehmung,” but this word, the equivalent of Perception has too
special a meaning to be used in so wide a sense. Would it falsify or
distort your meaning to call them “Trugschlüsse des unmittelbaren
Bewusstseins,” that is “Fallacies of Consciousness”? If being the
distinctive property of this tribe of fallacies is to
be—wrong—inferences which are mistaken for self-evident or intuitive
truths, this designation might perhaps fit them?

The description seems a good one, and in any case you are the best
judge.

Edition: current; Page: [135]
3. You will probably not object to my omitting the note at the foot of
I, p. 36 and for other reasons the foot-notes I p. 108-9 and I p.
343-4?6 I confess, I ask such questions as these chiefly in order that I
may be able to declare, without untruth, that no note has been omitted
without your express permission. In the text nothing has been omitted,
except untranslateable passages, viz. those which refer to peculiarities
of the English language or of single terms and their acceptations.

All these suppressions are very proper.

4. I p. 4, l. 15 fr. bel. “sanctioned by high authorities”7 refers to
the term, not to “an extension of the term”?

To “an extension of the term.”

5. I p. 308, l. 17 fr. bel. “an assertion involved in the meaning of
terms”8 = concerned with the meaning &c, not = implied in the meaning
&c? In other words I am not quite sure whether that expression is an
equivalent of “an identical proposition” or of “a mode of defining” &c
which follows.

A definition is, in my sense of the terms, an “identical proposition.”
But it is of no consequence which of the phrases is used as either will
fit my idea.

Dear Sir

Many thanks for your kind invitation, but I am quite unable to spare
time for the visit you propose.2

The extension of the middle class examinations to both sexes would
indeed be an important improvement.3

The system of farming which you mention4 differs from the metayer system
in its characteristic feature, the division of the produce. That the
landlord should provide the stock and implements is a matter of
necessity in a state of things in which the tenant cannot; unless, as in
Ireland, both parties are willing to dispense with anything which can be
called stock or implements at all. In this point of view, the beginning
and ending of the system you mention must be among the landmarks in the
progress of society in England.

You have done very rightly and judiciously, and I am glad to be spared
the crowd and turmoil of the present occasion. I should be a little
ashamed, too, as well as surprised, at being thought sufficiently
orthodox when Kingsley is not.2

I think with you that both American and French affairs look more
hopeful. The French elections must startle the wise journalists and
others who have been affirming for years that the French like and demand
despotism, though they knew all the while that the French had no means
(except a general election) of publicly shewing dislike to it.3

In America the pertinacity of the Free States gives me great confidence
in their ultimate success, and I have always thought that this war and
all its circumstances were very likely to elevate the national
character, as well as to stir up thought in the more cultivated minds,

Allow me to thank you for the present of game which you have been kind
enough to send.

All the recent American news is most cheering, and there now seems
little ground of fear for the future. I wish I could see signs of a
corresponding improvement in English opinion on the subject. It is still
the working classes and Edition: current; Page: [142] the greater as

with comparatively few noble individual exceptions. The Union and
Emancipation Society counts a great number of these among its promoters,

publications.2 If the Society wants, or whenever it does want, a renewal

Madame

aPardonnez-moi de n’avoir fait jusqu’ici aucune réponse directe à la
lettre que vous avez bien voulu m’écrire.2 Je croyais mieux remplir
votre désir en écrivant à celui qui est, à juste titre, l’objet de notre
commune sollicitude. J’écrivis sans délai, mais comme depuis lors je
n’ai pas eu de ses nouvelles, je n’ose presque pas lui écrire de nouveau
sans avoir préalablement demandé à vous ou à M. Wessel dans quel état
d’esprit il se trouve maintenant. En même temps je remplis le devoir de
vous assurer directement à quel point nous partageons votre peine et
votre inquiétude. Vous vous êtes servie, Madame, dans votre lettre
d’expressions de reconnaissance très au-delà de mon droit. Je serais
trop heureux de pouvoir les mériter, mais jusqu’ici je ne vois presque
rien que j’aie fait pour lui. S’il y a quelque chose que j’aurais pu
faire, c’eût été peut-être de lui donner, par des preuves d’estime, la
confiance qui lui manquait en lui-même. Ces preuves d’estime, il les a
eues, non seulement de moi mais de M. Grote, et je le crois sincèrement,
de tous ceux qui l’ont connu ici. Cela n’a servi bdeb rien quant à
présent, mais il faut croire que cela ne sera pas perdu dans l’avenir.
J’ai reconnu cdansc lui, dès le commencement, une haute capacité
intellectuelle: cette Edition: current; Page: [143] impression est allée
toujours en s’accroissant, tandis qu’une connaissance plus intime y a
ajouté une véritable estime morale. Ce n’est que plus tard que j’ai
reconnu chez lui cette extrême sensibilité aux impressions pénibles, qui
le rend en même temps très susceptible de souffrance et peu accessible
aux consolations. En lui écrivant je m’efforce toujours dded le décider
à en chercher dans les hauts travaux intellectuels dont il est si
capable, et dans la carrière utile et honorable qu’il peut remplir dans
le monde de l’intelligence comme dans celui des intérêts sociaux. Si
j’ai quelque pouvoir sur son esprit, je ne me lasserai pas de l’exercer
dans ce sens: et, ses autres amis aidant, nous finirons peutêtre par
réussir.a

Je dois à M. Wessel des remerciments dont je vous prie, Madame, d’être
l’interprète auprès de lui. eS’il est encore avec vous je lui aurai une
véritable obligation toutes les fois qu’il voudra bien nous donner des
nouvelles de son ami.e Nous partons incessamment pour Avignon, où nous
resterons jusqu’au commencement de l’année prochaine.

Veuillez, Madame, agréer l’hommage de mes sentiments les plus
distingués.

TO THEODOR GOMPERZ1

Saint Véran, Avignon

Sept. 17. 1863

Dear Sir

aLet me begin by saying how much I rejoice to hear that you are better
both in health and in spirits, and are vigorously at work, with a result
satisfactory even to yourself, which is always the most difficult thing
to a good writer.

Let me next thank you, which I do bveryb sincerely, for telling me
frankly what you have conc your mind against me. The only way to clear
up misunderstandings is to speak plainly about them, and some of the
impressions which seem to have been made upon you are such as if you had
not told them to me, I certainly should never have guessed. I feel as
strongly as you do the ludicrousness of your having to ask me what I
have seen to make me entertain I know not what mean opinion of you, and
I wonder that what you feel to be so ridiculous, you should nevertheless
have thought to be probable. I may in my turn ask you, what you have
seen in me Edition: current; Page: [144] which made it likely that,
absolutely without cause, I should have formed an unfavourable opinion
of one for whom I have professed, and continue to profess, so much
esteem and regard? As to the idea that any intimate friend of mine, or
any person deriving information from me, has spread any reports or
communicated any impressions disadvantageous to you, I am sure, since
you say it, that you yourself fully believe it, but I tell you with the
same frankness you have used to me, that I disbelieve it totally.

Surely, too, I may well be surprised that you should think anything of a
bad joke about Vienna, which I have not the smallest recollection of
making, but which, I am quite sure, had not the slightest reference to
you? I can only have meant, that the next time we went to Vienna there
would perhaps be something new to be seen there.

My letter from Avignon2 was quite another thing, and knowing as I now do
the state of your feelings, I can well understand your being pained by
it. But you must recollect that I did not dthen knowd what I know now,3
and it never entered into my head that your object in coming was to say
anything particular, which you thought you had not had an opportunity of
saying before. I thought that you simply desired to see the place and to
see us, and in so doing I neither thought you obtrusive, nor imagined
that you expected anything but what your knowledge of our friendship for
you perfectly entitled you to expect. But knowing that my time was much
occupied, I feared you might be disappointed; and it seemed right to let
you know that I could not give you so full and free an invitation to
come whenever it might be convenient to you, as I had done in England;
and to tell you so before you had undertaken so long a journey under
what might have been a mistaken impression that I had more leisure for
seeing friends here than in England. I thought I was using a freedom
which I could not have taken with a mere acquaintance, but which I ewase
even bound to use with a friend.a

To speak now of a pleasanter subject; your publisher4 has no need to
take any steps for obtaining authority to publish a translation of the
Utilitarianism. I am the sole owner of the copy right, and neither I nor
my publisher has made any reservation of the right of translating that
or any other of my works. But as you wish for a declaration that you
have my concurrence and sanction for translating it, I give you such a
declaration with much pleasure. As you have not told me in what language
it should be written, I write it in English, but will repeat it in
French if Edition: current; Page: [145] desired. I expect both pleasure
and benefit from the essay of your own which you intend prefixing to
it.5

yours very sincerely

I thank you for your two letters, and their various inclosures, by which
I have been much interested. I hope that your connection with the Sydney
Morning Herald2 will continue as satisfactorily as it has begun. I have
read all your articles in the Penny Newsman3 some of which I liked very
much and I have little doubt that I shall like your Essay on Colonies;
but I will, as you desire, criticize it freely.4 I do not, any more than
you, agree entirely with Mr Goldwin Smith.5 I think that a Edition:
current; Page: [146] sort of modified federation between a mother
country and colonies may be usefully maintained as long as neither party
desires to separate.

Do not send anything more to this address at present, as we return to

you at Blackheath when you are in town and it is convenient to you to
come.

TO THE GARDENERS’ CHRONICLE AND AGRICULTURAL GAZETTE1

Saint Véran, Avignon

Jan. 26, 1864

I have just seen in a newspaper a piece of intelligence which I
earnestly hope is not true, but which is stated so circumstantially that
I fear there must be some foundation for it.2 The statement is, that the
Royal Horticultural Society intends offering three prizes for the three
best herbaria of every county in England, and three additional prizes,
for the best of these best. If this most inconsiderate resolution has
really been taken, I am sure it must have been in the absence of those
members of the Council who have any real sympathy with British Botany.
If it be carried into effect, the present year 1864 will be marked in
our botanical annals as the date of the extinction of nearly all the
rare species in our already so scanty flora. If the extirpation of these
rarities had been the direct object of the Society, they could have done
nothing more effectual than by inviting, not simply three botanists in
every county, but all the dabblers in plant collecting, a race whose
selfish rapacity certainly needs no additional stimulation, and all of
whom may think they have a chance of one of these prizes, and holding
out to them a positive inducement to hunt out all the rare plants in
every part of the country and to carry off all they find, or destroy
what they do not carry off, in order that not only they may themselves
possess the plants, but that their competitors may not. Already our rare
Edition: current; Page: [147] plants are becoming scarcer every year.
You are, no doubt, aware how rapidly, for example, the rare Kentish
Orchids are disappearing. The Royal Horticultural Society is proposing
to treat rare plants as King Alfred treated wolves,3 and this under the
profession of encouraging local botany—as if local botany could be
encouraged by destroying that on which it feeds, or as if anyone were
likely to begin studying the science in hopes of collecting a good local
flora in a single summer. All local botanists will be thrown into
consternation by this project, and, if it is not yet too late, I am sure
they would all join in entreating you to use your good influence towards
stopping so destructive a scheme.4

He is one of the very few French teachers in England who are teachers by

April 12, 1864

Dear Sir—

You have put to me a question which it is very difficult, or rather
impossible, to answer satisfactorily. There is no one living of whom I
would venture to affirm beforehand that he might be expected to write
such a treatise on the fundamental problems of religion & morals that it
would be good for him to give up a profession he likes & change his
plans of life rather than not write it. I should expect confidently that
if you threw your whole mind into writing such a book, or indeed any
other book which you are at all likely to write, it would, at the least,
contain a great deal that would be valuable. But it deserves
consideration whether even the best book that could be written in our
day, on morals & religion Edition: current; Page: [149] generally, would
do more good than may be done by the continual illustration & discussion
of the leading points of those subjects, in connection with particular
speculative or practical questions. For such discussion you have a
decided talent, & it would afford the materials of many books as well as
periodical writings. However this may be, the question is one which no
one but yourself can decide. It is my creed that any one who can do
anything, of an intellectual kind, well, is usually a better judge than
other people what he can do best, & what it is of most use for him to
attempt.

We leave for Avignon before next Sunday, but after our return I shall be
happy to have any discussions you may desire with you.

Dear Sir

I have delayed writing, in hopes that I should, long before this, have
heard from you of your intended publication;2 but aI have now been so
long without news of any kind from you, that I much wish to know how you
are in health, and how you are going on in all respects.3 You would be
very much mistaken if you thought that I feel less interested in you, or
less desirous to hear from you, than before the painful circumstances
which were the subject of our latest correspondence. If these
circumstances make any difference, it is the contrary way. And, besides
my interest in you, I feel a strong interest in what you do. I believe
you to be capable, as few are, of doing important things both in
philosophy and in erudition—the former of a kind specially required at
the present time, and perhaps even more so in Germany than elsewhere:
and I am anxious that such a capacity should be turned, as much as
possible, to the benefit of the world.

I have little to tellb which regards us. Our life has been going on in
the usual manner. I have been working hard at my book on Hamilton,4 and
it is now well Edition: current; Page: [150] advanced towards
completion. You are one of the most competent judges of such a book, and
one of those whose approbation of it I most desire.

I lately saw M. Littré5 at Paris, and in conversing with him on the
state of German philosophy, I mentioned your name. I was glad to find
that he is in correspondence with you, and to the extent of his
opportunities, appreciates you justly.a

the slavery question not to have attended to what is going on respecting
it in Brazil as far as I had the means. I have read all the letters
signed C (not doubting that they were yours)3 as well as all those of
your antagonist,4 and the comparison has strengthened the impression I
already had that you are entirely in the right. But there is a strong
party in England now who will always give slaveholders their good word
in spite of all evidence. It is no wonder you have against you those who
are again trying to induce England to renounce the attempt to check the
African slave trade.5 But the Daily News ought not to join with them,

which I also enclose, because I think it alters the aspect of matters
considerably and I doubt altogether whether Mr Kyllmann’s plans will be
carried out for some time to come. But they are for the future: and I
think you will be interested in seeing that there is a considerable
following for them among the younger leaders of the working men.

As you will see that I was asked to take an active part in the intended
movement, it may be well to say that I have refused to join in demanding
the suffrage for all men, to the exclusion of women, and required also a

Dear Sir

aI have delayed thanking you for the first number of your Herculanean
series,2 in hopes that I should have been able to say something about
the work itself. I have, however, been so busy, that I have not yet had
time to do more than read your Preface and Introduction and merely
glance at the Greek text. What you say of it, however, proves it to be,
at the very least, a highly important and novel contribution to the
history of Greek thought; and I look forward with great pleasure to
making a real study of it at some not distant time.

But, interesting as such labours are, you are capable of things much
more valuable than such mere editorial work. I cannot wish that you
should leave unfinished what you have so well begun, but I shall be glad
when the time comes to which you seemed to be looking forward in your
last letter, now some months ago.a In the same letter you promised me a
longer one, which I hope will not be much longer delayed; though, by my
own delay in writing to you, I have almost lost the right to say so.

bI hope, before this, you have received the book on Hamilton, and also
the first of two articles which I have written on Comte’s philosophy.
The second article is in print, and I expect to be able to send it to
you before it is published in England.3 I shall be well content if you
are half as well pleased with these, as you are sure to be with Mr
Grote’s book on Plato.4 This is nearly all printed, and I have read most
of it; and both in point of learning and of thought it comes up to my
highest expectations. It cannot, I think, fail to produce a great effect
in Germany, where the thoroughness of his knowledge of the subject will
be much better appreciated than by an unlearned public, which can only
take it on trust.b

I did receive, and thought that I had acknowledged, the copy you were
kind enough to send of your work on Logic.2 I read it attentively, and
the only knowledge I have of Prof. Boole’s system is derived from it.3
My impression was, that there is great ingenuity and power of
consecutive thought, both in the system itself, and in your modification
of it. But you are quite right in supposing that I do not see, in the
result attained, any value commensurate with the mental effort. I look
upon it as I do upon Mr De Morgan’s elaborate system of numerically
definite propositions and syllogisms: as a remarkable feat of mental
gymnastics, capable of being very useful in the way of a scholastic
exercise, but of no considerable utility for any other purpose.4

I did not make any mention of Mr Boole in my book on Hamilton, the book
being quite long enough as it was. But if you, or any other of Mr
Boole’s admirers,5 should make the book an occasion for raising any
discussion on the point, I shall be very well pleased.

suppose that the amount of thought, not of a commonplace kind, which
they contain, and their applicability to existing and important

avec vous en matière de philosophie. Je n’en mets que plus de prix à
l’accord qui existe entre nous sur l’une des plus graves questions de la
science politique. Je me flatte d’ailleurs que si nous différons sur
quelques-uns des principes les plus généraux, nous tirons souvent
peut-être de nos principes différents les mêmes conclusions. Depuis
longtemps je pense et je dis que la pratique dépend bien moins de la
philosophie première que de la seconde—des axiomata media de Bacon:4 et

nombre de ceux-ci en commun avec des philosophes qui les acceptent

Dear Sir

It is a very tempting offer to place the great circulation of the Daily
Telegraph at my disposal for so important a purpose as the one you
mention. As a mark of confidence in me, it deserves my thankful
acknowledgment, and I cannot be supposed to be ill affected to a journal
which gave me such able and powerful support at the Westminster
election. But it is totally impossible for me to have any personal
connexion with a paper which takes the part the Telegraph does on the
Jamaica question.2 Not only every principle I have, but the honour and
character of England for generations to come, are at stake in the
condign punishment of the Edition: current; Page: [161] atrocities of
which, by their own not confession, but boast, the Jamaica authorities
have been guilty; and I cannot, while that question is pending, select
as my official organ on another subject, a paper with which, in a matter
of such transcendant importance, I am at open war.3

TO THE TRUSTEES OF OWENS COLLEGE1

Blackheath Park, Kent

May 4, 1866

Such of Mr. Jevons’s writings as I am acquainted with give evidence of
decided originality, much knowledge and mental vigour, and an unusual
degree of precision of thought and investigation.

His essay on the Gold Question2 was the first starting point of the
important series of discussions which has changed, and, it may now
almost be said, settled the opinions of instructed men on the subject.

Edition: current; Page: [165]
The merit of his investigation of the “Coal Question” can hardly be
rated too highly.3

His “Logic of Quality”4 showed extraordinary familiarity with and power
over Formal Logic, and if I had a fault to find, it would be that the
expenditure of power was greater than any result to be obtained by that
mode of employing it would sufficiently remunerate.

Of Mr. Jevons’s teaching powers I can say nothing; of these, however,
the authorities of Owens College can judge from their own experience.
But as regards his knowledge both of Logic and of Political Economy, so
far as the whole can be judged from a part, I should form a very high
estimate of it.

Dear Sir

No subject connected with the representation is of greater practical
importance than bribery and election expenses, and I hope that a great
and united effort will be made by reformers on the subject.2 But
Gladstone, in introducing the Franchise Bill, was understood to give an
express promise to take up this subject when he has done with the other,
and he certainly shewed a very strong feeling of its importance.3 It
seems to me, therefore, that the time which he indicated for himself, is
the best time for us; and it is probable that he will then be willing
and desirous to listen to any suggestions on the matter from persons
whom he respects.

Thank you for your note. I am aware that in this country and in all

landed possessions were held subject to, and even as a provision for,
public duties, and that the idea of absolute property in land is
essentially modern. You, however, as a Constitutional lawyer, know
infinitely more on the subject than I do, and I shall be very glad to
have the opportunity of consulting you when I again have occasion to
touch on the point.

The other fact you mention, that the expenses of elections were once a
public charge, is new to me, and will be a most telling point to bring
forward when that subject is before Parliament, which it is sure, very
shortly, to be.2 When that time comes, I should be very glad indeed to

of the Chamberlain &c. by the Common Council of London and not by the
Common Hall of the City. I also propose to insert, among the officers so
elected, the Common Sergeant.3

I am sorry the Draft of the Bill was given (by Mr Beal) to the Star
without ampler warning. The article in the Star was well meant,4 but
indiscreet as to the City, and its ascribing your note (notwithstanding
the initials) to me, was hardly excusable even by the haste with which

The questions mooted in your letter of July 28 are very important, and
extremely difficult if not impossible to decide by a general rule,
without many allowances for Edition: current; Page: [181] differences of
position which point out to different persons different paths of
usefulness. As you say, it is absurd to refer each man to his individual
conscience since the very question is, what his conscience ought to
prescribe. While I sympathize fully in your perplexities, I do not know
when I should be able to fix a time for discussing them at length,
either viva voce or in writing: but I would endeavour to find time for
reading the statement you speak of, and for giving some sort of opinion
respecting it. I am, Dear Sir

yours very sincerely

lieu à la formation de la Ligue Internationale de la Paix a toutes mes

pareil mouvement. J’applaudis de tout mon coeur aux efforts des hommes
éminents qui ont fondé la Ligue, et je me félicite de l’honneur qu’ils
me font en désirant mon adhésion. Cette adhésion leur est toute acquise,

Dear Sir

Excuse the delay in acknowledging your valuable letter of July 29. Your
report, and that of Mr Webb,2 are not encouraging as to the immediate
prospects of the Women’s Suffrage movement in Dublin; but though it may
not be yet time to organise a Society there, it is all the more
desirable to obtain as many adherents as possible from Ireland to the
Society of which I have the pleasure of inclosing the papers. Besides
the Executive Committee of ladies whose names you will see,3 the
Edition: current; Page: [183] Society consists of a General Committee
who are the constituency and subscribe a guinea a year, and of ordinary
members subscribing a shilling. If the Society might have the benefit of
your name and Mrs Haslam’s in either capacity, it would give me very
great pleasure.

Several Irish Liberal members of Parliament have already joined the
General Committee, among other Messrs Maguire, Blake, O’Beirne, Sir John
Gray, and Mr Pollard Urquhart.4

I am well acquainted with your pamphlet,5 which is very good as it is,
though I have no doubt that any addition or alteration which you would
now make would still further improve it. I regret extremely that the
state of your health is such as you mention, and I hope that rest and
abstinence from unnecessary nervous and cerebral excitement will in time
reestablish it.

Dear Sir

Owing to absence from England I did not receive your paper on Tests2
until long after it was sent, and had to wait much longer before I could
give it proper attention. I think it an exceedingly fair and clear
statement of many of the considerations and counter considerations which
really exist in the minds of conscientious men and influence their
personal behaviour in the matter of Tests. And I agree with you in
thinking that an ethical theory—a fixed moral principle, or set of
principles—respecting the bindingness of the obligation of a test, would
be very desirable. But it seems to me that such fixed principles cannot
be laid down for the case of Tests by itself; that the question requires
to be taken up at an earlier stage, and dealt with as part of the much
larger question, What, on the principles of a morality founded on the
general good, are the limits to the obligation of veracity? What ought
to be the exceptions (for that there ought to be some, however few,
exceptions seems to be admitted) to the general duty of truth? This
larger question has never yet been treated in a way at once rational and
comprehensive, partly because people have been afraid to meddle with it,
and partly because mankind have never yet generally admitted that the
effect which actions tend to produce on human happiness is what
constitutes them right or wrong. I would suggest that you should turn
your thoughts to this more comprehensive subject. You possess several,
far from common, qualifications for dealing with it: a strong
conscientious interest in it, and the power of representing to yourself
clearly and distinctly, without prejudice or partiality, the pro’s and
con’s of a moral question. There is therefore good reason to hope that
your meditations on the subject would not be unfruitful. Apart from this
more general subject of consideration, there would be little use in any
remarks that I could make on the special question of Tests; the
discussion of which, in the way in which you have treated it, cannot
perhaps be carried, with any useful result, much further than you have
done. I am Dear Sir

yours very sincerely

Dear Sir

I have no doubt of the sufficiency of your reasons for postponing the
translation of my Address, and had not the smallest notion of
complaining of it. With regard to your Preface, you are at full liberty,
so far as I am concerned, to put anything you please into it; and
criticisms on the German Universities as tried by the standard laid down
in the Address, would be very appropriate. The faults of the German
Universities are not comparable in badness to those of the English, but
that they have many grave faults I am quite prepared to believe, and
there can scarcely be a more useful service than to point them out. And
just because the German Universities are more learned and more
scientific than the English, they are likely to be more imbued with the
prejudices of commonplace learned and scientific men, who are generally
quite ignorant of everything out of their particular Fach, and are
almost as insensible to the value of large general ideas as the
practical men of common life. I am, Dear Sir

for me to enquire into the subject, and ascertain what ground exists for
the complaints, which, however, on the shewing of the letter, have a
just claim to be heard. It occurs to me that with your extensive
knowledge of continental affairs, you may possibly know something about
the condition and government of Heligoland, or that you may not be
indisposed to look into the matter. It would be a kindness to the
Heligoland people if you would do so; for these small dependencies have
seldom any one in Parliament who has any connexion with them, or feels

Monsieur

J’ai, en effet, reçu la brochure que vous avez eu la bonté de
m’envoyer,2 et je l’ai lue avec la plus vive satisfaction. Je ne l’ai
pas lue dans un esprit de critique, et comme il y a déjà quelque temps
de là, je ne saurais dire si j’y ai remarqué, ou non, Edition: current;
Page: [188] des choses susceptibles de dissentiment, mais je puis
assurer que s’il y en a, elles ne sont pas importantes, qu’elles ne
touchent à rien d’essentiel dans la question, et ne sont pas de nature à
attérir l’admiration que j’éprouve pour la manière dont vous soutenez
cette grande et importante lutte.

La formation d’une association à Zurich est très importante. L’adhésion
d’un ci-devant vice-roi du Caucase3 est intéressante comme hommage à la
verité des principes que nous soutenons; bien qu’on ne voie guère de
quelle manière on pourrait en faire l’application aux institutions de la
Russie.

La nouvelle idée fait des progrès ici comme ailleurs, et elle ne
manquera pas de profiter des discussions qui seront nécessairement
soulevées par l’application imparfaite et bornée qu’on a faite de la
représentation des minorités dans la loi de Réforme.4 Le principe est si
évidemment juste et raisonnable dans tous les systèmes politiques, que
pour être accueilli il n’a vraiment besoin que d’être discuté.

Dear Sir

aIf my circumstances permitted me to help all who want aid, or even all
authors who want aid; and if I had the pleasure of knowing anything of
yourself otherwise than through your writings, the repugnance I feel to
the opinions expressed in those writings would very likely be no bar to
sympathy and interest in your individual self. But as my own motive for
writing has always been the desire to defend and to excite sympathy for
that which I hold to be the highest of all causes, that liberty against
which the system of Slavery is the deepest outrage, I can never see any
attempt to hold up slaveholders to sympathy without deep regret.a And I
think that even to mention such virtues as they may possess, without
accompanying that mention with an expression of abhorrence of their
vices, is to deprave the sentiments and confuse the judgment of the
public.

Were I in any way peculiarly called upon personally to aid any one
engaged in doing this, I should do it, but I should do it with regret.
Were there no one else in this country who shares your opinions, I might
think myself personally called upon; but while you say that nine tenths
of the English public are of your way of thinking, it seems to me that
even had I the pleasure of your personal acquaintance, it would be to
those nine tenths that you would justly look for sympathy, which such
little aid as it could in any case be in my power to give should be
reserved for those who have fewer friends. It is not, therefore, from
any want of interest in yourself, or want of sympathy with you as a
struggling author, but from my deep sense of the moral value of all
literary work, that I felt myself obliged to reply as I have done to
your letter: and I am Dear Sir

Nothing could be more fortunate than that Alderman Lusk has influence at
Greenock.2 One of the subjects which he takes greatest interest in, is
the Diplomatic Service, and I had only to tell him of the great use you
would be of on that subject, to secure his warm support for your
candidature. He knows most of the people of importance at Greenwich on
the liberal side, and has promised to give me on Monday a letter to be
given by yourself to his brother,3 which will ensure your being
introduced to them. It would, I think, be well if I were to introduce
you personally to him, which I can do at almost any time you like to
come to the House as he is a very constant attendant.

From your note, I suppose what I had better say to Mr Gladstone is
simply to express a hope that no rival candidate will be put up for
Greenock.4

It is now pretty certain that the Bribery Bill will not be abandoned.
Some of the advanced Liberals have been in communication with the
Government and have offered a deputation of liberal members to Disraeli
if it would help him: and if there is one, I think it will be a very
strong one.5 Nobody whom I have asked has refused to join in it.

I do not know of any book on the Employment of Women except one of Mrs

relevant to the subject, is the advantage to women of developing their

that women can do; and the resemblance of the system of restricting
particular occupations to one sex, to the old caste and guild systems
which restricted them to certain classes and families. One of the

Dear Sir

Your letter gives me very great pleasure, for it is doubly an honour to
receive such expressions of interest and sympathy from one of your
country. You have gone through a harder fight than we are likely to face
here, and the heroism with which it was fought by the noble minded men
of America through all the long years of danger and difficulty, and
finally through the sharp crisis of the war, makes the Liberals of all
other nations look up to the advanced party in America with respectful
admiration. Like yourself I was somewhat surprised and a little hurt at
the line the Daily News thought fit to take, but there are reasons to
suspect that there may have been personal causes for this, for I thought
it my duty to support in one place a candidate who was the rival of a
gentleman who, I am given to understand, has influence with the Daily
News, and this may have aroused a little unpleasant feeling, which, as I
have no reason to suppose it is shared by many persons connected with
the paper, we must hope will blow over when the election excitement is
past.2 For my own part, my regret was only at seeing a paper which
Edition: current; Page: [202] had stood so bravely by the advanced cause
in so many great questions, shewing on this occasion less generosity of
spirit than the Daily Telegraph, or even perhaps, the Times. I am, Dear

Dear Sir

I think it of very great importance to free and enlightened thought in
politics and philosophy, that the Westminster Review should be
maintained in existence, and without any change in its long established
character as an organ always open to the thoughts of the most advanced
thinkers, and training the minds of the younger men to appreciate new
ideas. During the whole term of its existence, now 45 years, it has
fulfilled this office. Its disappearance would leave a sad blank in our
periodical literature, and would be a severe blow to advanced thought
and to the education of future thinkers. With regard to the management
of the Review by its present proprietor and editor, knowing as I do the
great difficulties it has had to struggle with, and the inferiority, as
compared with many other reviews, of the inducements it could hold out
to writers, I have been as much surprised as pleased at the high level
of merit it has been able to maintain. This could only have been
effected by a devotion of time and energy to the purpose, on the part of
the editor, which does great honour to his public spirit, and
establishes on his part a strong claim to the gratitude of the friends
of advanced opinions and independent thoughts, and after the proofs he
has given, for a number of years and under great difficulties, of his
fitness to conduct such an organ, I hope that he may find such
assistance as may enable him still to carry it on, and may afford him an
ultimate prospect of some recompense for his sacrifices, other than the
consciousness of having made them. I am, Dear Sir

very sincerely yours

Dear Mr Grant Duff

I hear from the Mauritius sad details of the distress there,2 with which
I do not doubt you are very much better acquainted than I am. Perhaps
you may not be as well aware that among a portion at least of the
English there, there is a feeling of uneasiness as to the probable
action of the local Government in case of disturbances, which seem very
probable. The disturbances at Réunion3 may add to the probabilities of
something of the sort at the Mauritius, and the example set by the
Government in the one place is not a salutary one for the Government in
the other. The inhabitants of the Mauritius are understood to be
peculiarly peaceable, and very manageable by gentle means: but there
seems to be a sort of apprehension lest the Government should not take
as gentle means as might be desired in case any difficulties should
arise. When I remember the reiterated warnings which were received at
the Colonial Office before the events in Jamaica,4 and that a hint from
home to the Government might have saved such a quantity of suffering, of
disgrace, and of embarrassment to everybody concerned, I venture to
trouble you with these few lines to say that whether these apprehensions
with regard to the Mauritius are well or ill grounded (which I do not
know) I know them to be entertained by Englishmen in a respectable and
responsible position.

I cannot conclude without expressing the pleasure it gave me to see you
appointed to a post where there is so much opportunity of exercising
useful influence.5 I am, Dear Mr Grant Duff

TO JOSEPHINE BUTLER1

March 22. 1869

Dear Madam

It would be a very superficial view that could suppose that the
permanent improvement of the social, industrial, and economic condition
of women can be altogether separated from their claim to political
rights. At all times political rights have been the only real security
for the permanence of progress in social, industrial, and economical
matters: and in the present age, the grant of political rights to any
class, or even the demand for their admission to those rights, is the
most effectual way of securing better consideration for their interests
in all other respects. It does not, however, follow from this that it is
equally the duty of every one who desires to improve the condition of
women, to engage specially in the task of claiming political rights for
them: and therefore, although I could not concur with Dr von Hetzendorf2
in considering the political enfranchisement of women as of but little
consequence (if indeed he does consider it so) the advice he gives
appears to me, with one exception, exceedingly judicious. aI am of
opinion that every kind of effort, whether social or political, in
favour of women, should be encouraged, so long as it is earnest and
genuine; and I am persuaded that those who are in earnest will
inevitably be led by experience to see the absolute necessity of
political enfranchisement as both the foundation and the safeguard of
human worth and happiness.a As regards the details, the earnest minds of
each nation are the best judges for that nation. They have but to be in
earnest, and to work with all their hearts, and they cannot do wrong.
The one point to which I have referred as that on which I differ from Dr
von Hetzendorf, is the suggestion to subordinate the whole organisation
of the Vereine to one centre. This is the French system, in too many
things: England and Germany have progressed by leaving freer play to the
varieties of local character and circumstances. What is judicious for
Berlin may not be so for Leipzig or Vienna. It is better that the zeal,
the earnestness, and the sense of responsibility, of the enlightened
persons of each locality, should exhaust itself in doing to the very
uttermost all that lies to its own hand to do, and that it should not
waste its energy in guiding the hands of others. I am Dear Madam

Dear Mr Gomperz

aI am not sure whether, when I last wrote to you, I mentioned the work
in which I was engaged, of preparing a new edition of my father’s
“Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind” with notes,2 bringing up
the subject to the latest improvements in psychology. This is now
complete, and the notes, to which Mr Grote has contributed, and in which
Mr Bain has given, in a condensed form, the most important thoughts of
his systematic treatises,3 form, I think, a very valuable addition to
the original work. I hope you have received the copy I directed the
publisher to send.a

I do not think that my portion of the notes4 can well be included in the
collected German edition, as they would seldom be intelligible if
separated from the work to which they belong.

bHow is the editionc proceeding?b I have just received an agreeable
evidence of the demand for it, in the shape of a proposal from a Dr
Bingmann,5 encouraged, as he says, by two professors of Moral Philosophy
in the Universities of Tübingen and Berlin, to translate
“Utilitarianism,” and after that, the Logic and others of my writings. I
have informed Dr. Bingmann of the edition in progress (which he did not
seem to have heard of) and have told him that there is no opening for
another translator, unless you should be disappointed in some of your
arrangements.

When you write to me, which I hope will be soon, I beg you to give me
news of your sister, whose sad loss we were so grieved to hear of.6 I

both superficial & confused. He has been so useful in popularizing some
good ideas that it is a pity he is not only commonplace but even of an
antiquated form of commonplace in others; unluckily he is not the only
useful & clever man I know in this predicament.

I am not surprised that you do not find time to read the Analysis.3 I am
often Edition: current; Page: [207] surprised at the great industry you
exhibit but I shd like to see a review of the Analysis by yourself & the
book as originally written without the aid of the notes is almost a
necessary foundation for efficient thought both in law & politics, for
which the doctrine of the Assn of Ideas as there developed is
all-important.

inconceivable is almost universal, and Hamilton is certainly not free
from it.2 I may, therefore, very possibly have been misled by it in my
interpretation of some passages of his writings. But I think my argument
against Whewell holds good in either sense.3

The concluding paragraph of your letter gives me great pleasure,
especially your agreement with my opinions on the great question

Dear Sir

I have had the pleasure of receiving your note; and your paper on the
Irish land question2 has been one of the first things I have read after
my return here.3 I need hardly say that I agree with all your
principles, and (as far as I can judge) with your details too.
Englishmen who know India are the men who can understand and interpret
the social ideas and economic relations of Ireland. They are not the
slaves of English technicalities, and they know that the English form of
property in land is neither a law of the universe nor an immutable
principle of morality. The Cobden Club could not have done a more
sensible thing than to ask you to give them the benefit of your Indian
experience;4 and I wish they would publish this very instructive paper
also. In any case, I trust it will be published.

You seem to think that there is some difference of opinion between us on
the subject, but I can see none. You think that my proposal would give
more to the landlords than the value of their property: but what I
proposed was, that there should be a Commission to adjudicate what the
present income and future prospects of the estates was really worth to
the landlords, in order to give them that; not a farthing more.5

Will you excuse my suggesting the omission of one word (p. 43, last
line) the word “woman”?6 This would be but justice, for women are often
most energetic and successful managers of estates in India. I am Dear
Sir

Dear Miss Carpenter

You are welcome to make any use you like of my letter to you,2 but I do
not feel that what the Duke said,3 which I repeated to you in my letter
to the best of my memory verbally, was sufficiently explicit to amount,
to my mind, to a promise, and therefore I should not like to write to
the Chief on such an assumption. I agree with you most cordially as to
the welcome that the Chief and the Ranee4 ought to receive here, and
will lose no opportunity of using any influence I have to secure it. If
the Duke of Argyll was more explicit to you than to me, or if what he
said to me appears to you explicit I am very happy to hear it, and think
you cannot do better than convey it to the Chief. But as the Chief can
scarcely so well judge of the exact meaning of the terms used as we can,
the responsibility of the precise interpretation to be put upon the
Duke’s words rests witha bus: and I own that to me they do not seem
quite as decisive as might be desirable, seeing how important it is that
the Chief and the Ranee should not come over here under a mistaken
impression.

If it is your wish, and you are quite sure that it would be the wish of
the Chief and the Ranee, I will write to the Duke, and ask him whether
what he has said may be reported to them as a promise.

You are aware of the favour with which the majority of the popular party

as a means of restraining bribery and intimidation and the increased
interest which this question has assumed through the recent extension of
the suffrage.2 The writer of the inclosed letter3 and some of his
friends are anxious to obtain information that can be depended on,
respecting the practical working of vote by ballot in the countries in
which it exists by law. Their own opinion, like mine, is unfavourable to
it; but their desire is to find the truth, whatever it may be; and the
vague impressions current in Europe give no real knowledge of the ballot
in America even as it exists by law, much less of the mode in which it
is actually conducted, and the advantages and disadvantages which are
found in practice to attend it. You would oblige me very much, and would

Dear Sir

I am late in thanking you for the gift of your volume on Ireland,2
because it came to me a short time ago in a parcel from England, and
owing to the pressure of other occupations I have only just finished
reading it. I wish it was in the hands of everybody who will have any
voice in the decision of the Irish Land question, for I have read
nothing that comes near it in the fullness and clearness of the
knowledge it communicates of the real “situation” in Ireland. There is
nothing like Indian experience for enabling men to understand Ireland.
Those writers in the newspapers who have some understanding of the Irish
question are those who, like one of the editors of the Spectator,3 know
something of India. My own official knowledge of Indian matters has
greatly helped me to put the right interpretation on Irish phenomena. I
wonder how long it will take the English people to find out, that the
Indian service is their best, or rather their only, good school for
administrators; and to make the use they might make of that service for
difficult work in other parts of the empire. Lord Metcalfe and Sir J.P.
Grant4 are already cases in point.

I am not so clear about the details of your proposed measure, though I
agree fully in its principles, and think it quite reasonable that lands
which are at present administered on the English system, the landlord
making the improvements, and no tenant right or claim to compensation
for loss of occupancy being ever Edition: current; Page: [215]
recognised—where, in fact, the coproprietorship of the tenant never
existed, or has been extinguished—should remain as they are, on the
footing of contract only.5 But I have great doubts of the possibility of
meeting the justice of each separate case by the award of a Commission,6
even with the aid of the general instructions laid down in your letter
of Nov. 29.7 I should fear that a decision as to what had or had not
been the “ordinary practice of any district, locality, or estate”8 would
continually fail to give satisfaction; first, on account of the
difficulty of settling what amounts to “ordinary practice”, and next,
because a very large proportion of the discontent of the tenantry is on
the part of those who have not yet succeeded in establishing any custom
in their favour; and these, if your plan is adopted, will find
themselves cut off from hope. I am not shaken in my belief that the land
difficulty is a knot which cannot be untied, and will have to be cut.—By
the way, your principal objection to the plan I proposed rests on a
mistake.9 I proposed giving the landlords more than their present net
rent, but not more than the present selling value of their estates,
since that includes allowance for prospective increase as well as for
present income.10 I never dreamed of giving them a larger compensation
than the amount of consols equivalent to that selling value. No wonder
you disapprove of the proposal, when you think it would enable landlords
to obtain from the State double the present value of their property.

It gives me great pleasure to find that, after due explanations, your

all. I have no doubt that your plan would work to the ends you intend by
it, if the Commission were an entirely Edition: current; Page: [216]
unprejudiced one. But all the probabilities are that it will be a
Landlords’ Commission. All Englishmen of the higher ranks who have not
learnt better things in Ireland or India, have their prepossessions
strongly on the side of landlordism. The best that is to be hoped is
that the Commission would represent liberal landlordism: but you know
how little that amounts to, Lord Dufferin is considered a liberal
landlord.2

It will give me pleasure to talk over these matters with you, and Indian
matters too, after my return to England, which will be in March. I have
not forgotten the kind offer you made when I was in the House of

Dear Sir

Your letter2 was forwarded to me from England. I received it the day
before yesterday, and should have answered it before, but I have been
incapacitated from work by a very bad cold.

I think you not only perfectly fit for the office of Registrar of
Friendly Societies but probably superior to any one likely to be a
candidate.3 The office is one for which your knowledge of the working
classes and of their Associations is a valuable preparation. And as to
practical ability, no one who goes carefully through the Municipal Bills
would think that the man who drew them can be deficient in it.4 In all
the conversations and discussions I had with you respecting those Bills,
the part you took was that of a careful, cautious, foreseeing practical
mind. If my saying as much in a letter for the purpose could be of any
use to you, I should be most happy to do it. But I greatly doubt not
only its being of any use, but Edition: current; Page: [217] its not
being positively detrimental to you. I must in frankness admit that I
fully agree in your impression that Mr Lowe probably looks upon you as a
sentimentalist.5 I do not doubt it. But I think you are under a mistake
if you do not think he looks upon me as a sentimentalist of quite as
deep a dye; if indeed he thinks there can be anything to choose between
different degrees of such imbecility. I am afraid that a testimonial
from me to your practicality would be to him a testimonial from a blind
man in favour of a man with one eye. Nor would it be much better if I
gave testimony to your powers as a metaphysician or political economist.
None of these are matters on which Mr Lowe would think me capable of
aiding his judgment. I only know one man whose testimony in your favour
would have much weight with Mr Lowe, and that man is Mr Lowe. Although I
doubt whether there exists the man whose judgment would have any
intellectual weight with Mr Lowe, it is just possible that some
practical influence might be exerted by influential members of the
electoral body of the London University, or by his superiors in the
Cabinet. I think Mr Lowe would give an office to a competent man if he
could find one; but seeing that it is a thousand chances to one that he
thinks none of the candidates fit, such trifles as parliamentary or
electoral or cabinet influence might decide him where he thinks there is
very little to choose. I am, Dear Mr Ludlow

Dear Mr Hill

I saw the article in the Daily News on the case of Policeman Smith, and
felt very much obliged to you for getting the subject noticed.2 I
understand that the Home Edition: current; Page: [218] Office is
inquiring into the case. If the result be favourable, the article in the
Daily News and other notices in the press will have greatly contributed
to it. In any case, a considerable degree of public approbation has been
deservedly directed against the magistrate and his dictum.

I am glad that, while you still continue to write for the Daily News,
there is at the same time a prospect of your being relieved from the
mere drudgery of the occupation, and obtaining leisure for other
pursuits.

Your account of Cairnes is cheering, and accords with others which we
have received.3 He himself never takes a sanguine view of his condition,
but there is ample proof how much of his health and strength he must
have recovered, in his ability not only to deliver his lectures, but to
write such an article as that in the Fortnightly, which, independently
of its merits in point of thought, seems to me quite a model of
philosophic stile and expository talent.4

I have read, I believe, all Rae’s letters,5 for the Daily News generally
reaches us at some time or other; but ever since the pretence began of
not examining foreign newspapers,6 we do not get them till after
ridiculous delays, and not unfrequently a later newspaper before an
earlier. The exact reason I do not know, but it is certain that an
announcement that a thing will not be done is generally, in France,
followed by its being done more than before; as an announcement that it
will be done is, in like manner, followed by neglect to do it. I do not
know how much depends on the higher authorities, and how much on the
subordinates; for in every system of arbitrary government the chiefs
find it necessary or convenient to give the underlings their full share
of the arbitrary power, and indeed cannot well enforce on them, duties
to the public which they themselves habitually violate. One has only to
live in a country arbitrarily governed (as France has been under all its
governments) to know how utterly mistaken is the idea that a despotic
government is a vigorous one.

Dear Mr Rogers

I thank you very much for the present of your Adam Smith.2 I have read
the Preface, but have not yet made myself acquainted with your notes,
which, though they do not occupy much space, seem to go over a good deal
of ground. I rather think that I differ from you on some important
points; but the old generalisations of political economy are now found
to require so much modification, that our opinions may possibly draw
nearer together when duly compared.

Thanks for your invitation to visit Oxford. There is no place which at
present interests me more, or which seems to be undergoing a more
salutary transformation. But I have seen only just enough of it in the
body, to have been much impressed by its beauty and imposingness. I
certainly did not write any of my books there, nor did I ever take up my
abode in Oxford for more than a day or two at a time. I am, Dear Mr

TO CAROLINE LINDLEY1

July 29. 1870

Dear Miss Lindley

Since you ask my opinion as to whether it is most advisable that your
nephew Robert2 should go up again for examination, or that he should
join his father and brother and commence at once the practical study of
his intended profession under the advantageous circumstances of being
directly under his father; so far as I am able to judge, this last
appears to me greatly preferable. Should he even succeed at the
examination, this success if attained in a single year, could probably
be only the result of strenuous cramming, and the time so occupied would
be almost lost time in respect to his real mental development. Many
youths fail at examinations, as examinations are commonly conducted,
merely because they are not quick in catching up and recollecting
detached points, and cannot give themselves the appearance of knowing a
subject unless they know it thoroughly. This may be Robert’s case, and
if so, he cannot too soon begin to learn that which it is necessary he
should know thoroughly, and his knowledge of which can be tested by
results instead of by questions on a paper: and if he begins at once, he
will probably enter with strong interest upon the new kind of work, and
take it up with spirit and vigour. If, on the contrary, he goes up for
examination again and should unfortunately suffer a second defeat, the
discouragement may be such as to paralyse his energies for a long time
to come: while, if he succeeds, the moral consequences may not be at all
desirable; for if he is a steady thoughtful youth, he may know very well
that he has only succeeded by coaching, and may have learnt a lesson not
at all conducive to thoroughness and earnestness in the work of life. If
the real intellectual advantages of the University education are
desired, I am of opinion that several years should be given to attaining
them; so that the successful passing through the examination may prove,
not readiness of wit, nor power to burthen the memory with a mass of
matter for a short time, but thorough and familiar acquaintance with the
subjects of the examinations. To have passed the examination is, to my
mind, and, I know, in the opinion of many of the examiners, far from a
conclusive test of having passed through the really useful discipline of
education. The examiners may do what they can to make it so, and yet
fail, if parents encourage the system of forcing youths hurriedly on. A
thorough and well grounded professional education is of more value to
the habits of mind than a hasty and superficial university one. Of
course when there is time for both, it is well to Edition: current;
Page: [222] have both; but I think a superficial training of any sort is
a distinct disadvantage both to the moral and intellectual progress of a
growing mind: and when I speak of hurried and superficial, it must be
borne in mind that that which might not be hurried for one character may
easily be so for another. I am, Dear Miss Lindley

yours very sincerely

I am much obliged to you for the opportunity of reading your Memoranda.2
I am glad to find that the Sanitary Commission are likely to report in

Administration should be included in the duties of a Minister of Public
Health, as it seems to me quite sufficient in itself to occupy a
ministerial department.

I never was more astonished at anything I have read in print about
myself, than when I saw the writer against Poor Laws in Macmillan not
only claiming me as of his way of thinking, but actually putting forth
his proposition for abolishing the Poor Law as taken from me.3 I am
entirely of the opinion expressed in my Political Economy, that a Poor
Law, giving the destitute a right to relief (on terms more onerous than
the condition of the independent labourer) is a necessary part of a good
public administration.4 I have even been strengthened in this opinion by
all Edition: current; Page: [224] that has come to my knowledge
concerning the effects of the public charities in a country where there
is no legal right to relief, and where most of the evils produced by our
poor law administration when at its worst, flourish exuberantly without

referred to as Edition: current; Page: [226] commending it: and he then

I beg to acknowledge your letter of July 27 which owing to my absence

Your desire for an organization to give true information to England &
France respecting one another & to correct mutual misapprehensions is
very laudable.2 But I believe that the information which it would be
possible to supply, especially on the French side, would be, in the vast
majority of cases, false information. The monstrous absurdities which
have been & still are believed even by highly educated people in France,
& the multitude of mere lies which are invented, circulated, & generally
credited here respecting what takes place in France itself, would make
it impossible for any French Committee to supply England with that
authentic information which they themselves would seldom possess. Things
are a little better in England, but even if an English Committee were
able to lay before the French people the exact truth, no part of it
would be believed except what agreed with the national prejudices or
party prepossessions of each person. For these reasons, I hope too
little from your experiment to be willing to take part in it, though I
shd be most highly gratified if it were successful.

Private:

Dear Sir—

I thank you for your letter of the 22nd of April last. The information
it contains relating to the politics of Victoria is very interesting, as
to me much of it was new.

I entirely agree with you that compulsory & secular education is the
most important of all questions for Australia. If this can be obtained,
& successfully worked, all other questions will, in a country like
yours, very soon come right of themselves. It is to be feared that the
new ministry, having a Catholic though one of the best of Catholics at
its head,2 will do all it can to discourage this movement. As for
state-assisted immigration, whether it is desirable or not it clearly
ought not to be carried into effect in opposition to the public opinion
of the colony. But I have always thought that the unoccupied lands of
Australia were prematurely given up to the governments of the several
colonies, & ought to have been reserved as the property of the empire at
large until much greater progress had been made in peopling them. The
renunciation of them was by no means a necessary consequence of the
introduction of responsible government. The step, however, cannot be
retraced & it is to be hoped that the principle of the State being the
sole landlord may be adopted in Australia so far as respects
unappropriated land while there still remains a great quantity of land
in that condition.

I cannot agree with Mr Higinbotham3 in his idea that the legislature shd
consist Edition: current; Page: [233] of only 40 or 50 members, elected
by the whole of the colony as one constituency, & largely remunerated.
Forty or fifty are too few for a deliberative assembly, & too many for
an administrative board, neither is it desirable that the legislature
should administer; & if men are paid two or three thousand a year merely
for legislating, they will think themselves bound to earn their salary
by legislating a great deal too much. Besides, so long as Hare’s system4
is not adopted, the uniting of the whole electorate as one body would
deprive all minorities of even the imperfect representation which the
accidents of local opinion give them & the majority alone would be ever
heard in the legislature.

As to the question of separation, my conviction is, that it shd rest
entirely with the Australian people, & that our Govt & Parlt shd exert
no pressure either way. A time will of course come when the Australian
colonies, feeling strong enough to defend themselves unassisted against
any attack, will think the power of England to involve them in her wars
without consulting them, an evil more than equivalent to the advantage
of English protection. I confess that I shd reject separation, but I do
not think that the federal principle can be worked successfully when the
different members of the confederacy are scattered all over the world; &
I think the English people would prefer separation to an equal
federation.

I hope your university will soon follow the example of the university of
Sydney & that of Chicago, in the admission of women.5 At Chicago even
the law school has lately been opened to them on exactly the same
conditions as to male students.6 Their admission to serve on juries in
the Territory of Wyoming has been, according to the testimony of the
Chief Justice who had opposed it,7 eminently successful.

Pray give my compliments to Mr Rusden.8 It is very fortunate for
Victoria that it contains persons of such enlightened political opinions
as yourself, Mr Rusden & Mr Gresham.9

Dear Madam—

I thank you for your pamphlet2 which I have read with great interest &
which seems to me both well argued and well written. You have confined
yourself to a single item in the large subject of justice to women; but
that one item is of very great importance; & you have the advantage in
that instance, of making out what seems to be a case of necessity, since
from your statements it appears that unless women are admitted to a
large share in the work of public teaching, the popular education which
is the glory of Germany is in danger not merely of remaining stationary
but even of degenerating. I congratulate you cordially on your valuable
contribution to the cause both of women & of education & I hope it is
not the only one which they are destined to receive from you as a

TO [AUBERON HERBERT]1

[
29 Jan., 1872

]

I have read your letter with warm interest and sympathy, & the practical
effect on my mind would be to wish that you would pursue the plan that
has suggested itself to you, because it would, whatever its result, be
one of those moralizing influences of which there are so few & of which
the world wants so many; & also because the fact that it has suggested
itself to you makes you the fit person to carry it out.

The only point in which I do not agree with you is the impression that
the present time is a time of crisis. I have always felt very strongly
the truth of St. Paul’s saying, “Behold now is the acceptable time:
behold now is the time of salvation.”2 As every day of our lives is a
new year’s day, so the more one reads history & watches one’s own time,
does it appear to me that every time is a time of crisis: & perhaps
those times in which it appears the most on the surface are the least so
in fact; for it is the silent workings in men’s minds which are the true
crises of history. Connected with my disagreement, if I have understood
you rightly, on this point, is my deep agreement with you on the want
now beginning to be felt of new, high, & definite, moral
purposes—purposes capable too of inspiring lasting enthusiasm. But I
think that it will never be possible to work on any great scale on the
minds of the working classes, excepting by the same means & at the same
time that we work upon the minds of the earnest & intelligent among
other classes. In the present state of education & civilisation, working
men of native energy & talent are open to the same influences as other
people: & the most lasting effects upon the more commonplace characters
in their own rank will be produced by these men, & not by their social
superiors, however devoted & earnest.

I look upon it as the great work now to be done, to build up a system of
morals capable of inspiring enthusiasm & satisfying the intellect. My
own belief is that Edition: current; Page: [236] this will be a
development of Xtianity, properly understood; that it must be a
development from the state at which we are now arrived, worked out by
many minds, for that it is a task far beyond the powers of any one; &
that we are all contributing to it,—bringing stones as it were to the
building of the temple, when we attempt to clear up any high point of
morals or philosophy or science, inasmuch as truth will be the great
object of our new system, & the world is beginning to learn how precious
truth is in little things & in great. Thus it seems to me that your plan
might do much, as tending both to love of truth & to human sympathy: but
that lasting progress in the moral nature of all classes must come by
the same means, & that we can only hope for it to come very gradually.

After seeing you I remembered a prior dinner engagement which in an
unfortunate hour I made & should have written to you about it, but that
from what Grant told me I concluded there was no chance for this
Wednesday.

It is provoking, but pray try to fix some other day.

My dear Cole—

I presume this2 is printed only for private use. If it were to appear in
any newspaper or be otherwise published I should wish my name for
various reasons to be struck out.

As it stands, I have no correction to make in what you make me say, as I
have no objection to the substance of it & it only purports to be your
report of a conversation. If I were speaking for myself I should state
my opinion in rather different words, but that, if it is sure not to be
published, is immaterial.

I have not shewn it to Peacock or Melvill3 & had rather not to the
Edition: current; Page: [242] latter—therefore I should not save you any
trouble by becoming your medium of communication with the former.

Yours faithfully

Dear Cole

If I were you I would for the sake of apparent fairness cite rather than
describe the “ambiguous” letter from Hume,2 & I would avoid the words
hallucination or monomania. It seems to me that if you also suppressed
the whole of the concluding paragraph you would not at all weaken the
effect. All which is there said is so completely suggested by the
previous paragraph that you do not strengthen the impression by adding
anything more.

Perhaps also the short note, which is as it were the “lie direct” had
better be omitted.

Yours ever

Dear Chadwick,

It appears that your official frank is of no validity quoad postage to
or in India—Even the President of the Board of Control sends his India
letters here to be franked by the Chairman, Deputy Chn or Secretary who
alone have the power of franking—& whom I hardly like to ask to frank
anything larger than a letter since I cannot say that it is for strictly
official purposes. Perhaps there may be an opportunity of sending by a
private hand.

Dear Sir

I am extremely sorry to hear that you are unwell—and still more sorry
that you sat up waiting for me—especially as I was a little behind my
time; I was too late partly by being too early, and partly by making too
much haste—according to the old proverb.

I shall leave town for a few weeks on Friday night—if we could finish
this matter first it would be better, but if it would task your health
or your convenience in the least, we will wait till I return—which I
shall regret the less, as it will be somewhat inconvenient to myself to
come here tomorrow evening—however I think I could come.

Yours ever

J.S. Mill

A note addressed to me at the India House, early tomorrow, will reach me
in time. I leave at four.

TO AN UNIDENTIFIED CORRESPONDENT1

Dear Sir—

I very much recommend writing as an occupation of leisure, & as a means
of self-improvement, but not as a profession, or in the hope of making
money by it. The very best writers have almost always to wait many years
before they attain the reputation which procures lucrative literary
employment. If you like to send me your essay, I will willingly read it,
but however high my opinion of it may be, I cannot recommend it to
editors, from which even in the case of personal friends I find it
necessary to abstain. I see no objection to a young writer himself
offering his writings to editors or publishers. He must expect to be
generally unsuccessful, & will do well to persevere in writing & to be
content with such chance successes as may offer themselves.

LIST OF FORM LETTERS AT THE INDIA OFFICE LIBRARY AND RECORDS

as examiner of Indian Correspondence in the East India House, Mill
served as Clerk to the Secret Committee of the Court of Directors. In
this capacity, he frequently wrote to the responsible official of the
Board of Control, Thomas N. Waterfield (Senior Clerk in the Secret
Department), to request the release of various secret documents. The
form letter on these occasions, prepared by a clerk for Mill’s
signature, was worded: “I am directed by the Secret Committee to
request, that the Right Honorable the Commissioners for the Affairs of
India will be pleased to authorize the Committee to communicate to the
Court of Directors the undermentioned Secret Papers . . . .” Details of
the necessary documents followed.

In the course of preparing this volume we have discovered that the
following emendations should be made to the information provided in
Later Letters:

The MS of Letter 513.1 below, at the Houghton Library, has enabled us to
date the letter to John William Parker at CW, XVII, 2006, to 25 Oct.,
1847.

The unidentified recipient of the letter dated [Before May 8, 1868],
ibid., XVI, 1397, is probably Mrs. Mary Johnson of Birmingham.

The letter to Edward Livingstone Youmans, ibid., XVII, 1569, has been
dated 9 Apr., 1869, from the MS at the College of Law, Nihon University,
Tokyo.

The librarian at Northwestern University informs us, on the basis of
both internal and external evidence, that the recipient of the letter
dated 3 June, 1870, ibid., 1731-2, is not Herbert Spencer; no other
identification has been made.

The letter to David King dated [Oct.? 1870], ibid., 1768, may now be
dated 9 Nov., 1870, from information in Letter 1631A below.

See also the summary of the reordering of letters, most to Henry Cole,
on xvi below.

9
Cole, Mill’s intimate friend since 1828, was, at this time, an assistant
keeper in the Public Record Office and an active advocate of postal
reform; he was extremely ambitious for influence, but rather embarrassed
for money. Hickson, in contrast, was an older, more experienced radical,
with solid finances and a penchant for economy. The other player in the
struggle for control of the Review was John Robertson, Mill’s sub-editor
since 1837. For many of the details of the story and the references to
Cole’s diary in the Victoria and Albert Museum, we are indebted to
Rosemary T. VanArsdel, “The Westminster Review: Change of Editorship,
1840,” Studies in Bibliography, XXV (1972), 191-204. The new letters
here printed, however, as will be explained, alter the chronology she
suggested for those already in Earlier Letters.

Kemble’s letter is not extant, but see Mill’s reply of 14 October, CW,
XIII, 410-11.

With his mother and sister, Henry had been sent off to Falmouth, en
route for Madeira, probably immediately after a party at the Mills’,
mentioned by Cole, on 14 January. Mill’s letter to Clara (No. 274, CW,
XIII, 420) reveals that the doctor had admitted to him after their
departure that Henry’s case was in fact “alarming,” and that he had
recommended the trip only because Mill himself “so much wished it.”
Caroline Fox, the new family friend in Falmouth, noted in her diary on 8
February that “Mrs. Mill with her daughters, Clara and Harriet, have
been for some weeks nursing Henry Mill . . . in lodgings on the
Terrace”; this letter to Clara should then be dated to 22 or 29 January,
1839. (See Memories of Old Friends, 2nd ed., 2 vols. [London: Smith,
Elder, 1882], I, 102-3.)

15
CW, XIII, 419 and 421; Letter 273, headed “Thursday,” must have been
written on 6 February. Cf. VanArsdel, “Westminster Review,” 196-8.

16
No. 277, CW, XIII, 421-2.

17
The advertisement in the Examiner of Sunday, 1 March, 1840, describes
the number as “just published,” making the date of 27 February likely
for the letter.

Cole’s finances were undoubtedly one of the problems all along. He
wanted the Review badly, but could not quite find the money when
opportunity knocked, as it did, for example, on the 27th. The fact that
he does not record this problem in his diary is no surprise.

Cole’s diary for 4 and 10 August reports that he wrote some notices for
the September number and sent them to Hickson (VanArsdel, “Westminster
Review,” 202).

26
The dating of the letters in EL is as follows: No. 274 [Feb., 1840]; No.
273 [Feb.(?), 1840]; No. 276 [Feb. or March(?), 1840]; No. 277 [Feb. or
March(?), 1840]; No. 275 [Feb.(?), 1840]; No. 278 [March(?), 1840]; No.
280, 12 Mar., 1840; No. 279 [March 1840(?)].

27
Only one volume, Theodor Gomperz, 1832-1912: Briefe und Aufzeichnungen
[hereafter Briefe] (Vienna: Gerold, 1936), covering the years up to
1868, was issued in Heinrich’s lifetime. A much-abridged version of the
remaining typescript, at Harvard, has appeared as Theodor Gomperz, ein
Gelehrtenleben im Bürgertum der Franz-Josefs-Zeit [hereafter Ein
Gelehrtenleben], ed. Robert A. Kann (Vienna: Österreichischen Akademie
der Wissenschaften, 1974).

28
See Introduction to CW, XIV, xx, and ibid., 238, n1.

29
There is only one lacuna in the collection; the last page of the
manuscript letter of 15 July, 1863, is missing. (In CW, XV, 865-6, the
letter is incorrectly dated 5 July.)

30
Gomperz’s letter of 20July, 1854, is in the Mill-Taylor Collection, and
Mill’s reply of 18 August is in CW, XIV, 238-9. Gomperz’s own
philosophical and philological studies were, as Mill put it, directed to
“exhibiting the speculations of the ancients from the point of view of
the experience philosophy” (324 below). A first draft of the translation
of the Logic, based on the 3rd ed., was apparently completed by the
beginning of 1855; see Gomperz’s letter to Heinrich Jaques of 7 January
(Briefe, 198-9), and Adelaide Weinberg, Theodor Gomperz and John Stuart
Mill (Geneva: Droz, 1963), 14-15.

31
Heinrich Gomperz’s account (Briefe, 233) suggests that Harriet Mill told
Gomperz that from the time she met Mill she had been a “Seelinfreundin,”
but no more, bothto him and to her husband.

32
MS at Johns Hopkins.

33
CW, XV, 581.

34
Ibid., 589.

35
Gomperz’s letter is at Johns Hopkins: Mill’s reply is in CW, XV, 739-40,
where the date is incorrectly given as 21 August. Gomperz had apparently
found some new interest in life through politics, and included copies of
four articles he had written from Budapest on the history of
Austro-Hungarian relations, three of which had been published in the
Neueste Nachrichten of Vienna; the fourth had not appeared, presumably
because the editor did not endorse his democratic and pro-Hungarian
proposals. See Weinberg, Gomperz and Mill, 25-6.

36
Letters to George Grote of 11 June and to J.E. Cairnes of 24 June (CW,
XV, 781, 784). Helen’s letter of 6 July to Fanny Stirling explains that
they had hoped to take the overland route from Smyrna to Constantinople
in order “to see the plains of Troy and to climb Mount Ida,” but were
dissuaded by the danger of fever and took the faster sea route (MS
Mill-Taylor Collection).

37
CW, XV, 786.

38
He seems to have tried unsuccessfully, it being the holiday season, to
make arrangements for Mill to meet his friends in Budapest (Briefe,
319-20).

39
See Mill’s reply of 14 December (CW, XV, 809 and n5).

40
In a letter to his mother of 3 March, Gomperz described his various
trips to Blackheath. On Sunday, 22 February, he first met Thornton, who,
on their walk back to the station, pointed out to him what a rare
privilege it was to be on such intimate terms with Mill, the best of
men, and went on to describe the three happiest weeks of his life, spent
the previous summer as a guest at Avignon. The second Sunday dinner
occurred on 1 March. It appears that Gomperz also apparently called;
uninvited, on Wednesday, 25 February, and again on Monday, 2 March; on
the latter occasion, Mill and Helen were not at home (Briefe, 333-5).

41
Ibid., 335. See also Proceedings of the Political Economy Club (London,
1882), IV, 212.

42
The occasion is described in a letter of 20 April (Briefe, 350-1).

43
See Mill’s letters to his publisher, Parker, of 14 March, and to Gomperz
of 22 March (CW, XV, 849 and 849-50).

45
Briefe, 338-41.

46
Ibid., 341-5. See also Weinberg, Gomperz and Mill, 34-5.

47
CW, XV, 854-5. Though Mill’s tone was gentle, his protestations about
not having enough time in Avignon to do justice to friends must have
rung rather hollow, given Thornton’s glowing account of his experience
the previous summer.

CW, XV, 861.

51
Mill’s letter of 16 June, to Harriet Grote, who had sent him good news
about Gomperz’s condition from a helpful Dr. Schlesinger, also tends to
confirm the supposition that Mill had called on him, by the remark: “I
have seen him twice, the last time for a whole evening” (ibid., 863).
The optimistic tone of this letter, 619, suggests that it was written
and despatched prior to his receiving Gomperz’s note, and replying to it
in 618.

MS, Mill-Taylor Collection. He presumably meant Volume I (1869), which
contained On Liberty, translated by himself, and Utilitarianism and the
Inaugural Address, both translated by Wahrmund; two of the three volumes
of the Logic (Vols. II-III); three volumes of the Political Economy
(Vols. V-VII), translated by Adolf Soetbeer; and Volume IX, Auguste
Comte and Positivism, translated by Elise Gomperz. He was still waiting
for Volume IV, in which he had incorporated, as an appendix, the changes
made to the 8th ed. See Weinberg, Gomperz and Mill, 56-7.

71
MS, Mill-Taylor Collection. The ninth volume was the tardy Volume IV,
the third of the Logic. Mr. Reisland of the Fues firm asked for
permission to include the Autobiography in the edition, but Helen
declined, and accepted the offer of Mr. Vogel of Meyer and Zeller of
Stuttgart (MSS, Mill-Taylor Collection).

72
MS, Mill-Taylor Collection.

73
An excerpt from Freud’s letter to Heinrich Gomperz of 9 June, 1932 (Ein
Gelehrtenleben, 106-7) explains the circumstances. Volume XII contained
his translations of the Enfranchisement of Women, “Grote’s Plato,”
“Thornton on Labour and Its Claims,” and the “Chapters on Socialism.” No
explanation seems to exist of the fact that Harriet Mill’s
Enfranchisement was included, and Mill’s Subjection of Women omitted.
The arrangements with Dr. Heinemann for a translation of the Subjection
had apparently fallen through, and another, by J. von Hirsch, had
already been published by this time (Berlin: Berggold, 1869). Perhaps
its appearance influenced the decision to issue the companion piece as
part of the edition.

74
His accompanying letter of 9 February, 1880, is in the Mill-Taylor
Collection.

88
James Rivett Carnac, son of a Company official and born in India, served
in the field from 1802 to 1822, when he retired and moved to England.
Elected Director in 1827, Deputy Chairman in 1835, and Chairman for two
successive terms (an exception to general practice), 1836-38, he had
returned to India as Governor of Bombay, 1838-41. Mill was citing a real
authority.

89
Henry St. George Tucker, the Chairman referred to, had also served in
India for more than thirty years. A Director from 1826, and Chairman in
1834, he led the Directors’ protest against the first Afghan War. It is
occasionally assumed that the Company was governed largely by men such
as James Mill, who had written a history of British India without ever
having visited the place, but it is well to remember that there were
Directors, such as Carnac and Tucker, and also officials, who brought a
wealth of experience in India to their positions.

We have not listed the purely formal addresses to Mill, from the
employees of the East India Company on his retirement, and from academic
institutions conferring honours.

1
MS in the India Office Library and Records. Folded and addressed: George
Grote Junr. Esq. / Queen’s Hotel / Edinburgh. Cancelled for: Buck’s Head
Inn / Glasgow. Wax seal bears initials JSM. The square brackets in the
text indicate conjectural readings made necessary by rips caused by the
seal. Published in MNL, XX (Summer 1985), 4-7, edited by John M. Robson.

George Grote (1794-1871), banker, M.P. (1822-41), and, later, historian
of Greece; Harriet Grote (née Lewin, 1792-1878). The Grotes were central
to the Benthamite group.

2
The donkey, placed equidistant from two bundles of fodder, starves
because it cannot decide which to eat. The dilemma, known as asinus
Buridani, is traditionally attributed to Jean Buridan (ca. 1290-ca.
1358).

3
Joseph Hume (1777-1855), Radical M.P. for Montrose, best known for his
constant attempts at economic reform, close associate of James Mill
(1773-1836), whose schoolmate he had been. Anthony Hammond (1758-1838),
barrister and advocate of Benthamite legal reforms.

4
See “Report from the Select Committee on the Criminal Law of England” (2
Apr., 1824), Parliamentary Papers [PP], 1824, IV, 39-405; the
recommendations, based entirely on Hammond’s testimony and submissions,
led eventually to partial consolidation of the criminal code in 7 & 8
George IV, cc. 27-31 (1827).

5
William Whitmore, a young Benthamite, of a family that produced several
members of parliament, now less well known than William Wolryche
Whitmore (1787-1858), his cousin, M.P. for Wolverhampton.

6
Mill is forecasting the appearance of “Price of Foreign Corn—Abolition
of the Corn-Laws,” Edinburgh Review, XLI (Oct. 1824), 55-78, by James
Ramsay McCulloch (1789-1864), the Scottish economist who was, in spite
of his strayings from pure orthodoxy, closely associated with the
Radicals, for example in the founding of the London Debating Society and
of London University. Indeed, in 1828 J.S. Mill contributed a note on
rent to McCulloch’s edition of Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations (in Essays
on Economics and Society, CW, Vols. IV-V [Toronto: University of Toronto
Press, 1967], Vol. IV, pp. 161-80). The views of the Westminster on the
matter were in the event expressed by Mill himself: “The Corn Laws,”
Westminster Review, III (Apr. 1825), 394-420 (in CW, Vol. IV, pp.
45-70). Evidently W.W. Whitmore either could not, or would not, write an
answer to McCulloch. Mill, however, took the pamphlet mentioned in the
next sentence, Whitmore’s A Letter on the Present State of and Future
Prospects of Agriculture, 2nd ed. (London: Hatchard, 1823), as the
occasion for his “Corn Laws,” in which he argued against McCulloch’s
article (without mentioning his name), while praising another of
McCulloch’s articles (see CW, Vol. IV, pp. 51 and 53). Mill also there
cites Whitmore’s promise to raise the issue in parliament (ibid., pp.
69-70).

7
William George Prescott (1800-65) became a partner in Prescott, Grote,
in 1822, and was an original member of the Utilitarian Society, founded
by Mill.

8
Thomas Tooke (1774-1858), a banker, was one of the best known economic
writers of the period, much noticed by Mill. He had reviewed in the
Globe and the Morning Chronicle Tooke’s Thoughts and Details on the High
and Low Prices of the Last Thirty Years (London: Murray, 1823) on its
appearance, and had just praised it in an article, “War Expenditure,” in
the 3rd number of the Westminster, II (July 1824), while apologizing for
not reviewing it (CW, Vol. IV, p. 4n). Tooke’s son, William Eyton Tooke
(1806-30), known by his middle name, whose views were evidently becoming
incompatible with his father’s, was one of Mill’s closest friends in
these years. Tooke’s suicide on 27 January, 1830, deeply affected Mill;
see CW, Vol. XII, p. 19, and Letter 29.1 below to J.B. Say.

9
The question centred on the increased numbers of Irish migrant labourers
who had found quicker and cheaper passage to Britain when regular
steamboat services began in 1816, and who were able to obtain work
partly because of the reluctance of British workers to migrate for
temporary work as they would lose their right to parish poor relief. It
was also becoming apparent that the Irish population was growing very
rapidly; it almost trebled between 1785 and 1841.

10
John Austin (1790-1859) and Sarah Austin (1793-1867) were almost second
parents to John Mill, who, after his return from France, had studied law
under John’s tutelage, and had played with their young daughter Lucy in
the gardens of the houses in Queen’s Square Place, where they were near
neighbours. The Mills in these years rented summer accommodation at
Dorking, in Surrey, where they spent their weekends and vacations;
Brockham Green is about two miles east of Dorking, a trivial distance
for the perambulating Mills.

11
This is a very early reference to John Austin’s almost complete
inability to fulfill the great promise everyone agreed he possessed. He
never did review Etienne Dumont’s redaction of Jeremy Bentham
(1748-1832), Traité des preuves judiciaires, 2 vols. (Paris: Bossange,
1823).

12
John Austin’s brother Charles (1799-1874) was at this time one of the
most outspoken of the young Radicals. He became a very successful
barrister, but retired from public life and issues.

13
Peregrine Bingham (1788-1864), a Benthamite barrister, friend of the
Austins, helped edit and wrote extensively for the early numbers of the
Westminster. George John Graham (1801-88), whose first article in the
Westminster appeared in July 1825, later was an official assignee of the
Bankruptcy Court. William Ellis (1800-81), subsequently known for his
educational and economic views, had just moved to the Indemnity Marine
Insurance Co. from Lloyds; he had written in the 2nd and 3rd numbers of
the Westminster (for the latter, see n21 below), and was preparing the
one mentioned in n17 below for the 4th number.

14
Patten might be either George (1801-65), the painter, who studied at the
Royal Academy after 1816, or John Wilson-Patten (1802-92), later Baron
Winmorleigh, who went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1821. One of
the Secretans is probably John James, author of Epitome of Foreign
Stocks, Most Currently Bought and Sold in London (1824), and other works
on commercial and financial topics.

15
A James Harfield is listed as one of the members of the London Debating
Society, but nothing more has been discovered about him. While no trace
has been found of an Edward Ellis, it may be that Mill had not yet
learned the spelling of the name of Edward Ellice Jr. (1810-80), son of
the well-known M.P., who later was secretary to Lord Durham in Russia
and Canada, and was known by Mill; though only in his fourteenth year at
the time, he may well fit the description in the letter, for Mill and
his friends were certainly not given to discouragement of precocity.

16
Richard Doane (1805-48), Bentham’s amanuensis, had preceded Mill as a
guest of the Samuel Benthams in France, and was connected with Mill in
all his early endeavours, including the Mutual Improvement Society that
was a forerunner of the Utilitarian Society.

17
All three articles appeared in the 4th number of the Westminster, II
(Oct. 1824): James Mill, “Periodical Literature: Quarterly Review,”
463-503; John Stuart Mill, “Brodie’s History of the British Empire,”
346-402 (in Essays on England, Ireland, and the Empire, CW, Vol. VI
[Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1982], pp. 1-58); and William
Ellis, “Political Economy,” 289-310 (a review of James Mill’s Elements
[London: Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, 1821; 2nd ed. revised, 1824]).

18
I.e., Harfield.

19
“Miscellaneous Notices, No. 11. Westminster Review,” North American
Review, n.s. IX (Apr. 1824), 419-26. Particular notice was taken of
William Johnson Fox (1786-1864), “Men and Things in 1823,” Westminster
Review, I (Jan. 1824), 1-18; and Peregrine Bingham, “Travels of Duncan,
Flint and Faux,” and “Periodical Literature: The Quarterly Review, No.
LVIII—Faux’s Memorable Days in America,” ibid., 101-20, and 250-68.

20
Mill is being mildly ironic, this idea being in fact the central point
in “Periodical Literature: Edinburgh Review (Part I),” in the 1st
number, 206-49, written by James Mill with considerable help from J.S.
Mill (see Autobiography, in Autobiography and Literary Essays, CW, Vol.
I [Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1981], pp. 93-5), who himself
wrote the continuation of the attack in the 2nd number (Apr. 1824),
505-41 (in CW, Vol. I, pp. 291-325).

21
William Maginn (1793-1842), “Letters to Timothy Tickler, Esq. (No.
XVII): To Christopher North, Esq., on the last Westminster Review,”
Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine, XVI (Aug. 1824), 222-6, attacking
particularly William Ellis, “Charitable Institutions,” Westminster
Review, II (July 1824), 97-121.

22
Thomas Robert Malthus (1766-1834), “Political Economy,” Quarterly
Review, XXX (Jan. 1824), 297-334. Though he had not seen this article,
Mill had written a year earlier an attack on Malthus’s view in reviewing
his pamphlet, The Measure of Value Stated and Applied (1823), in the
Morning Chronicle, 5 Sept., 1823, p. 2 (in Newspaper Writings, CW, Vols.
XXII-XXV [Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1986], Vol. XXII, pp.
51-60).

23
McCulloch’s “Disposal of Property by Will—Entails—French Law of
Succession,” Edinburgh Review, XL (July 1824), 350-75, was answered in
one of John Austin’s rare articles: “Periodical Literature: Edinburgh
Review, Number XL, Art. IV—Disposition of Property by Will [and]
Primogeniture,” Westminster Review, II (Oct. 1824), 503-53.

24
James Mill, in “Southey’s Book of the Church,” Westminster Review, III
(Jan. 1825), 167-212, made an onslaught on The Book of the Church, 2
vols. (London: Murray, 1824), by Robert Southey (1774-1843), the poet,
friend of Coleridge and Wordsworth, who, like them, had deserted early
radical views for conservative ones. The term, “the Satanic school,” had
been applied by Southey in the Preface to his A Vision of Judgement
(London: Longman, et al., 1821) to those “of diseased hearts and
depraved imaginations, who, forming a system of opinions to suit their
own unhappy course of conduct, have rebelled against the holiest
ordinances of human society” (pp. xvii-xxii).

25
“Knowledgeable about all things one can know.” The traditional title of
the “900 Theses” of Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463-94), often
quoted with the tag added by a wit (possibly Voltaire), et quibusdam
aliis (“and even a few others”).

26
The Courier and Evening Gazette (founded 1792), a conservative paper,
referred, in a leading article of 28 August, 1824, p. 2, to the
Radicalism of the Morning Chronicle, which defended the free-thinking
Richard Carlile (1790-1843), a target for governmental blasphemous libel
charges. The Chronicle replied to this attack on 30 August, p. 2, and
the Courier (an evening paper) responded on the same day, p. 2, quoting
from both its account on the 28th and the Chronicle’s reply. Mill had
himself at the beginning of 1823 written five articles over the
signature “Wickliff,” protesting against the prosecution of Carlile, his
wife, and sister. Three of these were published under the title “Free
Discussion” in the Morning Chronicle of 28 January, 8 and 12 February,
1823 (CW, Vol. XXII, pp. 9-12, 12-15, 15-18). The other two, Mill says
in his Autobiography, contained “things too outspoken for that journal,
[and] never appeared at all” (CW, Vol. I, pp. 89-91).

27
John Black (1783-1855), who had begun to take major responsibility for
the policies of the Morning Chronicle in 1817, was greatly influenced by
James Mill, and printed most of the journalism of John Mill in the
1820s. For the latter’s mature confirmation of the early judgment, see
Autobiography, CW, Vol. I, pp. 91-3, which includes mention of the
attacks on the “unpaid magistracy.” Some of these were, in fact, written
by Mill himself; e.g., “Blessings of Equal Justice,” and “Securities for
Good Government,” CW, Vol. XXII, pp. 43-6 and 62-4.

28
Francis Place (1771-1854), the “Radical tailor of Charing Cross,”
organizing force behind the Radicals’ agitations and campaigns, who had
received much of his political education from James Mill, was active at
this time, inter alia, in promoting Neo-Malthusianism.

MS at the College of Law, Nihon University, Tokyo. Addressed: John
Bowring Esq. Dated in another hand.

John Bowring (1792-1872), Bentham’s disciple, was editor of the
Westminster Review, 1824-36.

2
George John Graham’s “Law Abuses: Pleadings,” appeared in the
Westminster Review, IV (July 1825), 60-88; he continued the attack in
“Law Abuses: Pleading—Practice,” ibid., V (July 1826), 39-62.

A term adopted by Bentham from Richard Steele and John Horne Tooke to
apply to legal jargon: see, e.g., Bentham, Rationale of Judicial
Evidence, ed. J.S. Mill, 5 vols. (London: Hunt and Clarke, 1827), Vol.
V, p. 344.

Robert Mushet (1782-1828), a senior officer of the Royal Mint, was an
original member of the Political Economy Club. The niece was probably
Margaret Mushet (1799-1885), who later contributed to periodicals; her
poem was not noticed in the Westminster.

4
“Memoirs of the Affairs of Europe,” Westminster Review, IV (July 1825),
178-83, a review of the first volume of John Russell (1792-1878),
Memoirs of the Affairs of Europe from the Peace of Utrecht, 2 vols.
(London: Murray, 1824-29).

5
Mill was at this time (see CW, Vol. I, p. 71) reading the Lectures on
the Philosophy of the Human Mind, 4 vols. (Edinburgh: Tait, 1820), by
Thomas Brown (1778-1820), Professor of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh. He
did not, however, review David Welsh (1793-1845), An Account of the Life
and Writings of Thomas Brown (Edinburgh: Tait, 1825).

6
James Gilchrist (1783-1835), a General Baptist preacher and author of
etymological and philological works; Mill distinguishes him from John
Borthwick Gilchrist (1759-1841), formerly a surgeon in the East India
Company service, then Professor of Hindi at the Company’s College, who
wrote on Hindi philology. Neither wrote for the Westminster.

Jean Baptiste Say (1767-1832), French economist, visited England in 1814
and met James Mill and Bentham. J.S. Mill was his guest in France in
1820 and 1821, at the beginning and end of his year in France.

In 1830 the Athenaeum Club, founded in 1824, decided to expand its
membership by 200 to pay for its new building (still used). One hundred
new members, including Mill, were chosen by a committee (on which his
father sat); their nomination was announced on 12 June. The second
hundred were to be elected by the full membership. Of those Mill lists,
Charles Austin, Charles Buller (1806-48), recently elected M.P. for West
Looe, and Charles Romilly (1808-87) were successful at this time. Walter
Coulson (1794-1860), a barrister and editor, once amanuensis to Jeremy
Bentham, Abraham Hayward (1801-84), Tory barrister, whose relations with
Mill were seldom cordial, James Booth (1796-1880), a freethinking
Chancery lawyer, and William Ogle Carr (ca. 1802-56), another barrister,
were all elected to the Athenaeum in the next five years. Never elected
were John Sterling (1806-44), the brilliant Cambridge graduate, then
becoming a close friend to Mill, and John Samuel Martin de Grenier
Fonblanque (1787-1865), brother of Albany Fonblanque, the editor of the
Examiner, for which Mill was beginning to write.

3
George Bentham (1800-84), later a distinguished botanist, son of
Jeremy’s brother, Brigadier-General Sir Samuel Bentham, was one of the
recently elected members. In 1820 he had been Mill’s instructor in
botany and much else. William Carr was the son of Thomas William Carr
(d. 1829) a friend of Sir Samuel; George Bentham had been enamoured of
William’s sister, Laura.

MS in the Varnhagen von Ense Collection, Jagiellonian Library, Cracow.
Envelope addressed: Mrs Austin / 26 Park Road / Regent’s Park. Published
in Victorians Institute Journal, V (1987), 138-9, edited by T.H.
Pickett, and in MNL, XXIII (Winter 1988), 17-18, edited by Joseph
Hamburger. Mill set out for the Lake District on Friday, the 8th; so
this letter probably dates from the preceding Tuesday.

2
Mill’s journal of this walking tour in Yorkshire and the Lake District
(8 July-8 August) is in Journals and Debating Speeches, CW, Vols.
XXVI-XXVII (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1988), Vol. XXVII, pp.
501-56.

3
Mill is probably referring to his breakfasting with William Wordsworth
(1770-1850) at Henry Taylor’s on 27 February, 1831. He saw Wordsworth,
then living at Rydal Mount, briefly on 18 July, and spent 4-7 August at
Ambleside in order to visit him and his sister Dorothy.

4
Horace Grant (1800-59), like Mill, worked as a clerk in the Examiner’s
department at the India Office.

5
Francis Edward Crawley (1803-32), a member of the London Debating
Society, had accompanied Mill on a walking tour of Berkshire,
Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, and Surrey in July 1828.

6
I.e., from John Austin’s lectures on jurisprudence at the University of
London, which began in January 1831, with only eight students.

7
William Empson (1791-1852), Professor of Polity and Laws of England at
Haileybury College, contributor to and later editor (1847-52) of the
Edinburgh Review.

Lucie Austin (1821-69), later Lucie Duff Gordon, the Austins’ only
child.

1
MS in L/P&S/6/283, pp. 91-[n.p.], India Office Library and Records. See
Check List of Mill’s Indian Despatches in CW, Vol. XXX, App. A, No. 46.

William Cabell (1786-1853) was at this time Senior Clerk in the Secret
and Political Department at the Board of Control. In August 1839, his
responsibility for the Secret Department was transferred to Thomas
Nelson Waterfield, but he continued as Senior Clerk in the Political
Department. From September 1835 until his retirement in May 1841, he was
also Assistant Secretary to the Board of Control.

2
Murchison had explained his conduct in connection with his negotiations
with the Ex-Rajah of Kedah in a Political letter from Bengal dated 26
August, 1831.

1
MS in the Varnhagen von Ense Collection, Jagiellonian Library, Cracow.
Addressed: Mrs. Austin / 26 Park Road / Regent’s Park. Published in
Victorians Institute Journal, V (1987), 138, edited by T.H. Pickett, and
in MNL, XXIII (Winter 1988), 18-20, edited by Joseph Hamburger. Dated
certainly between January and July 1832, during John Austin’s third
series of lectures on jurisprudence at the University of London, which
Mill attended. Francis Crawley (see Letter 40.1 above) had attended the
lectures in 1831. The reference to Chadwick’s heavy commitment to
Bentham’s “affairs” suggests that the letter was written after Bentham’s
death on 6 June, 1832.

2
John Arthur Roebuck (1801-79), barrister, disciple of Bentham’s, and
intimate friend of Mill’s, M.P. 1832-37, 1841-47, 1849-79.

3
The reference is probably to Charles Romilly (see Letter 31.1), but
could be to one of his brothers, John (1802-74) or Edward (1804-70),
both of whom were in the philosophic radical circle. The “engagement”
was presumably for an article in the Foreign Quarterly Review, edited by
John George Cochrane (1781-1852) from July 1827 through December 1834.

4
Edward Strutt (1801-80), Baron Belper, 1856, M.P. for Derby 1830-48,
1851-56, was associated with the philosophic radicals in the 1830s.

5
Edwin Chadwick (1800-90), barrister, close friend of Mill’s, was a
disciple of Bentham’s, and an executor of his will.

6
The allusion is to Edward George Bulwer, Lord Lytton (1803-73),
novelist, editor, politician, member of the London Debating Society, and
author of the popular novel Pelham; or, The Adventures of a Gentleman
(London: Colburn, 1828).

7
Her birthday was 21 June.

MS not located; typescript McCrimmon. For the dating, see n2.

Henry Cole (1808-82), active in postal reform, member of the London
Debating Society, Mill’s companion on the tour to the Lake District
described in Letter 40.1 above, and on another later that month; see
Letter 54.1 below.

2
Don Giovanni, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-91), was produced at the
King’s Theatre, Haymarket, on 16 July, 1832, the role of Donna Elvira
being sung by Henriette Méric-Lilande (1798-1867), and that of Donna
Anna by Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient (1804-50). For Mill’s comments on
the latter during this season, see CW, Vol. I, p. 351, and CW, Vol.
XXIII, p. 465.

1
MS not located; typescript McCrimmon. Dated from internal evidence.

Mill and Cole set out the following morning, 19 July, for a walking tour
of Hampshire, West Sussex, and the Isle of Wight that lasted until 6
August. The plan to meet G. and R. (probably Grant and Roebuck) seems
not to have materialized. Mill’s journal is in CW, Vol. XXVII, pp.
557-611.

1
MS not located; typescript McCrimmon, who indicates it is addressed on
verso: Henry Cole Esq. / 4 Adam Street / Adelphi.

Mill had obviously been visiting the Buller family at Looe before
setting out on his tour of Cornwall; for the journal of this tour, see
CW, Vol. XXVII, pp. 613-37.

2
Gaetano Marinelli (1754-1820), Italian composer mainly of comic operas,
was popular among musical amateurs such as Mill and Cole.

1
MS not located; typescript McCrimmon. Dated from the entry in Cole’s
Diary for 18 March, 1833, Victoria and Albert Museum.

2
Mill’s mother, Harriet (née Burrow) (ca. 1782-1854), and his sisters
Wilhelmina Forbes (1808-61), Clara Esther (1810-86), Harriet Isabella
(1812-97), Jane Stuart (ca. 1816-83), and Mary Elizabeth (1822-1913).

2
The note, also dated 4 June, and directed to James Mill by Edward
Lawford, solicitor to the Company, follows J.S. Mill’s letter to Cabell
in L/P&S/6/289.

3
PC 1153 concerned the dismissal of the Resident at Lucknow, Mordaunt
Ricketts, for having taken bribes.

1
MS not located; typescript McCrimmon. Presumably after 15 Mar., 1833,
when Cole met Fonblanque at the Mills’, apparently for the first time
(see Letter 70.1 above), and quite possibly Friday, 2 Aug., 1833. Cole’s
Diary indicates that Mill called on him in the evening; they went to the
Kingstons, but as no one was home, they called on Horace Grant.

2
In the early 1830s Cole and the Mill family frequently spent musical
evenings with the Kingstons, who are otherwise unidentified.

1
MS in the German National Museum, Nuremberg.

Jérôme Adolphe Blanqui (1798-1854), pupil and assistant to Jean Baptiste
Say, Professor of Industrial Economy and History from 1825 at the
Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers, in 1833 succeeded Say as Professor of
Political Economy at the Conservatoire.

2
J.R. McCulloch was appointed to the Chair of Political Economy in the
University of London in July 1827, and held it until 1837; however, he
stopped lecturing in 1831 because attendance at his lectures was minimal
(sometimes indeed there were no students), and his remuneration was
inadequate.

3
Nassau William Senior (1790-1864) was appointed to the Chair in King’s
College London (established 1829), but was appointed a tithe
commissioner before the College opened in 1831, and consequently never
lectured. He resigned in March 1832, and was succeeded in January 1833
by Richard Jones (1790-1855).

4
Henry Drummond (1786-1860) established the Oxford Chair in 1825; for the
provisions, see CW, Vol. XXII, p. 327. Senior, who assumed the
Professorship in 1826, published An Introductory Lecture on Political
Economy (London: Mawman, 1827), Three Lectures on the Transmission of
the Precious Metals (London: Murray, 1828), Three Lectures on the Cost
of Obtaining Money (London: Murray, 1830), and Two Lectures on
Population (London: Murray, 1831). Whately published his Introductory
Lectures on Political Economy (London: Fellowes, 1831).

5
Favourable reviews of Senior’s lectures appeared, e.g., in the
Westminster Review, VIII (July 1827), 177-89, and, by Whately, in the
Edinburgh Review, XLVIII (Sept. 1828), 170-84. Whately’s Lectures were
widely praised; see, e.g., Mill’s review, Examiner, 12 June, 1831, 373
(in CW, Vol. XXII, pp. 327-9), and Thomas Perronet Thompson’s in the
Westminster, XVI (Jan. 1832), 1-22.

6
George Pryme (1781-1868), M.P. for Cambridge 1832-41, who began to
lecture in 1816, was recognized as Professor by the Senate in May 1828
and continued to lecture until 1863, evidently without salary. He
published A Syllabus of a Course of Lectures on the Principles of
Political Economy (Cambridge: printed Smith, 1816), which went through
subsequent editions, to which he added An Introductory Lecture in 1823.

7
Whately privately endowed the Chair at Trinity College Dublin in 1832;
Mountifort Longfield (1802-84) was the first incumbent, 1832-34.

8
Some of the lectures on political economy by Dugald Stewart (1753-1828),
who held the Chair of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh 1785-1809, are in
Vols. VIII and IX of his Collected Works, ed. William Hamilton, 11 vols.
(Edinburgh: Constable, 1854-60).

In 1825, during the administration of Robert Banks Jenkinson
(1770-1828), Lord Liverpool, McCulloch, with the assistance especially
of Macvey Napier (1776-1847), editor of the Edinburgh Review, attempted
to have a Chair in Political Economy established. Their Memorial to the
Government Concerning a Chair of Political Economy in the University of
Edinburgh (BL Add. MSS 38746, f. 219) was unsuccessful, being opposed
strongly by Robert Saunders Dundas (1771-1856), Viscount Melville, Lord
Privy Seal of Scotland.

10
At the end of 1805 Malthus was appointed Professor of History and
Political Economy in the newly founded College.

11
McCulloch’s far from occasional contributions to the Edinburgh Review
began with “Ricardo’s Political Economy,” XXX (June 1818), 59-87; his
most recent was “Complaints and Proposals Regarding Taxation,” LVII
(July 1833), 434-48. He wrote less frequently for the Foreign Quarterly
Review, his first article being “Wine Trade of France,” III (Jan. 1829),
636-49, and his most recent the two-part essay, “Prussian Commercial
Policy,” IX (May 1832), 455-70, and XI (Apr. 1833), 403-6.

12
Thomas Perronet Thompson’s first economic article in the Westmister was
“Absenteeism in Ireland,” X (Jan. 1829), 237-43, and his most recent,
“Property Tax,” XIX (July 1833), 1-9. (For full lists, see The Wellesley
Index to Victorian Periodicals, Vol. V.)

13
Mill is preserving the anonymity of John Pringle Nichol (1804-59),
astronomer and political economist, who was unsuccessfully recommended
in 1833 by James Mill and Nassau Senior for the Chair of Political
Economy at the Collège de France vacated by the death of Say. Nichol’s
first article in Tait’s Edinburgh Magazine was “Incidence of Tithes,” I
(May 1832), 224-8; his most recent, “Political Economy for Farmers,” III
(May 1833), 191-8.

14
In addition to John Austin, whose lectures in Jurisprudence ceased in
June 1833, and McCulloch (see n2 above), Mill is referring to John
Hoppus (1789-1875), who was appointed late in 1829 to the Chair in the
Logic and Philosophy of the Human Mind. His much criticized lectures,
which began in 1830, were very poorly attended.

15
The highly acclaimed Professor of English Law was Andrew Amos
(1791-1860). In medicine, the professors were John Conolly (1794-1866),
on the nature and treatment of diseases, David Daniel Davis (1777-1841),
on midwifery and the diseases of women and children, and Anthony Todd
Thomson (1778-1849), on materia medica and therapeutics.

16
In November 1833, Pellegrino Luigi Edoardo, Count Rossi (1787-1848), an
Italian who had been Professor of Roman History at Geneva before moving
to France, was appointed Say’s successor at the Collège de France. One
of the unsuccessful applicants was François Charles Louis Comte
(1782-1837), a liberal political writer, son-in-law of Say, known
personally to the Mills for a decade.

MS in the Osborn Collection, Yale University.

Effingham Wilson (1783-1868), London publisher.

2
The application was successful: the work by Victor Cousin (1792-1867),
translated by Sarah Austin, was published as Report on the State of
Public Instruction in Prussia (London: Wilson, 1834).

3
Mill’s authority might have been Harriet Taylor (1807-58), later his
wife, whose views on education he much valued. Whether or not he had
read the manuscript—and it seems unlikely that he had not—he quickly
reviewed the published work, “Mrs. Austin’s Translation of M. Cousin’s
Report on the State of Public Instruction in Prussia,” Monthly
Repository, n.s. VIII (July 1834), 502-13 (in Essays on Equality, Law,
and Education, CW, Vol. XXI [Toronto: University of Toronto Press,
1984], pp. 61-79).

Sanskrit scholar.

2
John Loch (1781-1868), a Director of the East India Company 1821-54, was
the Chairman of the Court of Directors at the time.

3
This College,also known as the Hindu College and as the Vidyalaya, was
organized in 1816 by a group of leading Hindus in Calcutta for the
purpose of teaching English and Western science to high-caste Hindu
boys. The College ran out of funds because of mismanagement, and by 1823
it asked the government for financial assistance. The government was
soon providing nearly all the required funds, although the
administration remained in the hands of the “native managers.”

Charles Masson (identified only as “a traveller in Central Asia”) was
apparently the pseudonym of James Lewis, an authority on Indian
inscriptions.

Bowring was one of two Commissioners who had submitted a “First Report
on the Commercial Relations between France and Great Britain,” PP, 1834,
XIX, 1-257; the “Second Report. . . . Silks and Wine,” by Bowring, did
not appear until the following year, both as a pamphlet (London: Clowes)
and in PP, 1835, XXXVI, 441-697.

Nichol presumably wanted the information in the reports as he was
preparing “Rae’s New Principles of Political Economy in Refutation of
Adam Smith,” Foreign Quarterly Review, XV (July 1835), 241-66.

1
MS in the National Archives of Canada, Ottawa. Dated extract in an
unclasped notebook of Harriet Roebuck, his wife.

2
Thomas Falconer (1805-82), a barrister, was brother to Roebuck’s wife.
The proposal was probably that Falconer become nominal editor of the
projected London Review; he was chosen, and served rather badly as, in
effect, sub-editor under Mill’s direction.

Mill’s letter is written on pages 3 and 4 of a letter dated 11 Sept.,
1834, from John Wilson, a Factory and Poor Law Commissioner, and editor
of the Globe and Traveller.

Adolphe Narcisse, comte Thibaudeau (1795-1856), one of the editors of
the radical Paris paper, Le National, who spent some time in England
after June 1832.

2
Wilson was offering three guineas for, at most, two articles per week.
He suggested that “minor points of difference between parties in France
. . . not be made too prominent,” and that “to censure Louis Philippe &
his government as they perhaps deserve would be to play into the hands
of the Tories.” He recommended that Thibaudeau treat of “the general
relations” and “the state of feeling” between the twocountries, and “the
grand continental divisions of interest in which France & this country
are opposed to the absolute military powers.”

3
Hippolyte Dussard (1798-1876), another radical journalist.

4
Perhaps Mill was trying to obtain music from the opera, La Niobé (first
performed 1826), by Giovanni Pacini (1796-1867).

Jean Baptiste Nicolas Armand Carrel (1800-36), the French radical editor
whom Mill most admired, was visiting England at this time.

Mill to Sarah Austin), and in MNL, XXIII (Winter 1988), 20-1, edited by
Joseph Hamburger.

The Austins were staying at Boulogne, as John Austin’s work in London,
both the Inner Temple lectures and his connection with the Criminal Law
Commission, had terminated. John Austin at this time was a victim of
depression and other ailments, and Sarah Austin recently had experienced
a nervous breakdown.

2
Mill was suffering from exhaustion and general debility, and he soon had
other symptoms—weakened lungs, a deranged stomach, and a nervous
twitching of the right eye.

3
James Mill became seriously ill, probably with tuberculosis, in August
1835, and died 23 June, 1836.

4
James Bentham Mill (1814-62) was on his way to India, where he joined
the East India Company’s civil service.

5
Charles Hay Cameron (1795-1880), a lawyer and one of Bentham’s
disciples, was on the law commission which was part of the Supreme
Council of India. He worked with T.B. Macaulay in preparing the penal
code for India.

6
Sarah Austin’s article, “D’Israeli’s Vindication of the English
Constitution,” had appeared in London Review, II (Jan. 1836), 533-52.

7
Sarah Austin translated the first two volumes of England in 1835, 3
vols. (London: Murray, 1836), by Frederick Ludwig Georg von Raumer
(1781-1873). Charles Buller did not review Raumer, at least not in the
London Review, nor did Sarah contribute.

8
Henry Bickersteth (1783-1851) became Baron Langdale in 1836, when he was
appointed Master of the Rolls. A friend of Bentham’s, he promoted law
reform.

Statesman (London: Longman, et al., 1836), which Mill with George Grote
reviewed in the London and Westminster Review, V & XXVII (Apr. 1837),

J.B. Alexandre Paulin (1796-1859), publisher and bookseller, was agent
for the London and Westminster Review in France.

2
In “Parliamentary History of the French Revolution,” London and
Westminster Review, V & XXVII (Apr. 1837), 233-47, Thomas Carlyle
(1795-1881), then an intimate friend of Mill and Harriet Taylor,
reviewed the published volumes of Philippe Joseph Benjamin Buchez and
Prosper Charles Roux, eds., L’histoire parlementaire de la révolution
française, which was being published in Paris by Paulin. (It was
completed, in 40 vols., in 1838.)

3
The early volumes, dealing with Africa, of Karl Ritter, Die Erdkunde im
Verhältnis zur Natur und zur Geschichte des Menschen oder allgemeine
vergleichende Geographie, 19 vols. in 21, 2nd ed. (Berlin: Reimer,
1822-59), were issued in Paris by Paulin in 1835-36 as Géographie
générale comparée, ou Etude de la terre dans ses rapports avec la nature
et avec l’histoire de l’homme, 3 vols. trans. E. Buret. Paulin also
published in 1836 the four volumes of Histoire de la Gaule méridionale
sous la domination des conquérants germains, by Claude Charles Fauriel
(1772-1844), historian and philologist. The notices Mill refers to have
not been located.

Carrel, whom Mill had met first in 1833, died on 24 July, 1836, from
wounds suffered in a duel with Emile de Girardin. For Mill’s tribute,
see “Armand Carrel,” London and Westminster Review, VI & XXVIII (Oct.
1837), 66-111 (in Essays on French History and Historians, CW, Vol. XX

John Robertson (ca. 1811-75), nominal editor (in fact, sub-editor) of
the London and Westminster Review from early 1837 until 1840.

2
It is probable that Colonel William Francis Patrick Napier (1785-1860),
historian of and participant in the Peninsular War, proposed that he
contribute the article that was published as “The Duke of Wellington,”
London and Westminster Review, VI & XXVIII (Jan. 1838), 367-436. (Mill
appended an editorial note indicating that the views were those of the
author, not of the review; see CW, Vol. I, p. 604.)

3
Charles Wetherby Reynell (1798-1892), printer of the London and
Westminster.

4
As published, John Robertson’s “Caricatures,” London and Westminster
Review, VI & XXVIII (Jan. 1838), 261-93, contains only slight reference
to James Gillray (1757-1815) and William Hogarth (1697-1764) on pp.
279-80; evidently what Mill omitted stayed out. See also Mill to
Robertson, CW, Vol. XII, pp. 362-3, presumably earlier.

William Bridges Adams (“Junius Redivivus”) (1797-1872), “Dr. Arnott, On
Warming and Ventilation,” ibid., 345-67. The joke reads thus: “A
proprietor who wished much to render his mines available to the public,
applied to a scientific gentleman . . . for a certificate of
[anthracite’s] durability. He obtained it, to the effect that the
certifier verily believed that it would be the last thing destroyed on
the day of judgment. About the same period a barn, in which a quantity
of the coal was stored up, caught fire, and the part not destroyed was
covered by the coal.” (P. 365.)

Lieutenant-Colonel Nathaniel Alves of the Madras Establishment was at
this time Political Agent at Rajputana.

3
Military officers holding civil positions, such as political agent, in
which no military duties were involved, had been forbidden to receive
their military pay in addition to their civil allowances. This
regulation had not been enforced for some years, and then retrenchment,
or recovery of monies paid, had been instituted, causing some hardship
and much dissatisfaction among the officers affected.

Wittul Row Dewanjee, dismissed as minister of the Gaikwar of Baroda in
1827, had subsequently been employed by the British Government to
administer a sequestered district, and large allowances had been granted
to him and his family. On his death, the legality of these payments was
called into question, and his nephew and adopted son, Christna Rao, was
making a strong claim for their continuance.

Cabell’s reply of 28 March follows Mill’s letter in L/P&S/6/309, pp.
453-[6], and provides a better statement: “My Dear Sir/ The alteration
in PC 2072 is, as you justly remark in yr letter of the 26th Instant,
rather obscurely worded: Its intention, I have ascertained would be more
clearly expressed if it were to run thus—‘& tho’ it might be very
desirable, as you state, to induce this Chief to continue responsibility
for the good conduct of the Babriawur Villages, we are not aware how
this could be allowed, as you have no right to enforce any such
obligation now that you have deprived him of sovereign Power over these
Villages.’ ”

earlier appointment of George Edward Gowan (d. 1865), of the Bengal
artillery, to the position of Commissioner in Kumaun.

Hajee Khuleel Khan, Ambassador to Bombay from Persia, had been killed by
a random shot during an altercation between his attendants and some
Sepoys in 1802. Since he was deemed to have been under British
protection at the time, the Government had offered, as a gesture of
compensation, an annual sum of money for purposes of charity, and
devotion at his tomb at Mujiff, in Persia. Arrears were now being
claimed by his son.

With the letter is a “Statement of Facts” of the case, dated at Malta,
23 August, 1838, signed by Diego Arangio, a merchant, the political
refugee in question, who had fled to Malta in 1837, where he was refused
asylum. Accepted by a French possession in Africa, he subsequently
obtained a passport, and returned to Malta to reestablish his business.
The British authorities there, under pressure from the Neapolitan
Consul, had then tried to expell him. Mill’s “Italian friends” included
Giuseppe Mazzini (1805-72) and Angelo Usiglio (1803-75), both of whom
were in exile in England.

Mill was responding to Robert Gordon’s note of 23 Nov., 1838, which
immediately precedes this letter in L/P&S/6/314, asking legal assistance
with the case of the legitimacy of the children of Francis Steddy,
Deputy Post Master at Ryepur, who had died intestate. As Steddy and his
wife, who were both Roman Catholics, had married after the birth of
their children, an opinion had been expressed that “according to the
Roman Catholic religion, children born of parents previous to their
marriage become legitimate on such subsequent marriage.”

Anthony Coningham Sterling (1805-71), brother of John, Captain in the
23rd Foot, and his wife Charlotte (d. 1863) apparently met John on the
outskirts of Rome on 4 April (see Carlyle’s Life of Sterling [London:
Chapman and Hall, 1851], pp. 236-7). Anthony and Charlotte visited Dr.
Carlyle in Naples in April, but John Sterling’s plans were altered by
the death of his infant son in England on 30 March.

Senior was on the supervising committee of the Political Economy Club
from 1835-1849, and so would be concerned about the schedule. In the
event, the question of Herman Merivale (1806-74), the Drummond Professor
of Political Economy at Oxford, was discussed on 5 December, 1839: “What
general principles should be adopted relatively to the employment of
Paupers, Soldiers, and Prisoners in productive labour?” Mill’s question
came forward on 6 February, 1840: “What would be the effect produced
upon Wages, if the rich should adopt the practice of expending a large
portion of their income on menial servants and retainers, and a smaller
portion in the purchase of Commodities?” Senior’s question was discussed
on 5 March: “What is the connection between the price of Provisions and
the Price of Labour?”

The announcement appeared in the June number of Vol. XXXIV, on the verso
of the Table of Contents: “The present number of this Review appears
under a new Proprietorship and Editorship, but without any changes in
the principles, nor, it is hoped, in most of the contributors, among
whom the present proprietors had long been numbered. . . . / No one
connected with the proprietorship or editorship of the London Review
being concerned in the present management, the word ‘London,’ which had
been annexed as part of the title on the junction of the London and
Westminster Reviews in 1836 will henceforth be dropped, and the Review
will appear under its original title of the Westminster Review. / The
only new features intended to be introduced into the management are
exemplified on the present occasion by the graphic illustrations
appended to the article which heads the number, and the miscellaneous
notices which conclude it.”

Richard Jenkins (1785-1853) was Chairman, and William Butterworth Bayley
(1782-1860) Deputy Chairman of the Court of Directors at this time.

MS at the Wordsworth Trust, Dove Cottage, Grasmere. Addressed: Dr
Calvert / Falmouth. Postmark: 25 April, 1840.

Calvert, whom Mill had met in Rome the previous year (see Letter 253.1
above), was staying in Falmouth for ill-health early in 1840, and there
met the Fox family and the Mills. In March, Mill had joined his mother
and sisters Clara and Harriet, who were attending his second youngest
brother Henry (1820-40) in his last illness. The Foxes, with whom the
Mills also became very friendly, were Robert Were (1789-1877), his wife
Maria (née Barclay) (1786-1858), and their children, Anna Maria
(1816-97), Robert Barclay (1817-55), and Caroline (1819-71), for whom
Mill prepared a “Calendar of Odours” of flowers (in CW, Vol. XXXI, pp.
257).

Probably William McDowell (b. 1794), who practised in Falmouth as a
cabinet-maker, upholsterer, and auctioneer.

3
Henry had died of tuberculosis on 4 April, at the age of nineteen.

4
William John Coope (1809-70), rector of Falmouth 1838-70.

5
Mill’s letter to Sterling of 22 April, is in CW, Vol. XIII, pp. 428-9.
Sterling had met Calvert in Madeira in 1837.

6
Henry Francis Cunningham (dates unknown, but active in Falmouth artistic
circles 1837-43), made portraits of John and Henry Mill.

7
Probably Frederick Charles Bullmore (1801-96), the surgeon who had
attended Henry Mill.

See Letter 284.1, above.

3
The Club, made up of Sterling’s friends, was founded in 1838 after his
return from Madeira; it met monthly for dinner and discussion. A list of
forty-one members is given in Carlyle’s Life of Sterling (London:
Chapman and Hall, 1851), p. 208.

4
Samuel Wilberforce (1805-73) was then rector of Brixton, Isle of Wight,
and later prominent as Bishop of Oxford. His brother Robert (1802-57)
was rector of East Farleigh, Kent, and then (in 1840) of Burton Agnes,
Yorkshire; he later converted to Roman Catholicism. Neither is listed in
the original membership of the Sterling Club.

5
Two of Mill’s Despatches from the Examiner’s Office of the East India
Company: “Affairs of the Guicowar” (2 July, 1840), partly printed in PP,
1852-53, LXIX, 259; and “Dispute between the Rao of Cutch and Certain
Wagur Chiefs” (8 July, 1840); listed as Nos. 979 and 980 in CW, Vol.
XXX, App. A.

6
An allusion to Mill’s well-known articles, “Bentham” and “Coleridge,” in
the London and Westminster Review, respectively VII & XXIX (Aug. 1838),
467-506 (in Essays on Ethics, Religion, and Society, CW, Vol. X
[Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1969], pp. 75-115), and XXXIII
(Mar. 1840), 257-302 (in CW, Vol. X, pp. 117-63).

7
On 6 April, 1842, Mill proposed to John William Parker a collection of
his articles; nothing came of it, however, until 1859, when Parker
brought out Dissertations and Discussions in two volumes. (A third was
added in 1867, and a fourth, posthumously, in 1875.) For his later
description of the revisions, see the “Preface” to Dissertations and
Discussions, CW, Vol. X, pp. 493-4.

James Stephen, “Works of the Author of the Natural History of
Enthusiasm,” Edinburgh Review, LXXI (Apr. 1840), 220-63, is ostensibly a
review of Physical Theory of Another Life. By the Author of “Natural
History of Enthusiasm.” The invented title is ascribed to Isaac Taylor
(1759-1829), engraver and later non-Conformist pastor of Ongar, author
of practical as well as uplifting works for the young.

10
As the Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th ed. explains, when potatoes lie
above ground, “they become green and have an acrid taste, which renders
them unpalatable to human beings, and as poisonous qualities are
produced similar to those of many Solanaceae [e.g., henbane, deadly
nightshade] they are unwholesome.”

11
Sartor Resartus, 2nd ed. (Boston: Munroe, 1837), p. 285 (Bk. III, Chap.
x). The allusion is to Diogenes Teufelsdröckh’s account of the sect of
Drudges (as compared to the Dandies), who live on “Potatoes-and-Point.”
Teufelsdröckh pretends not to know the meaning of “Point,” which derives
from the poor “pointing” with their potato towards bacon, cheese, or
other inaccessible extras, and then eating the potato ungarnished.

Mill had not favoured the introduction of the section headed “Critical
and Miscellaneous Notices,” though he contributed three notices to the
September number; see Essays on Philosophy and the Classics, CW, Vol. XI

The letter from John Pringle Nichol has not been located. During 1840,
Nichol was commissioning new equipment for the Glasgow observatory. The
matter had evidently been discussed during the Foxs’ recent visit to

The first Afghan War, in 1839, had resulted from Lord Auckland’s attempt
to restore to power Shah Shuja (1780-1842), the exiled King of
Afghanistan. Lieutenant-Colonel Claude Martine Wade (1794-1861) had had
singular success in forcing the Khyber Pass and capturing Kabul.

5
Mill is presumably thinking of Akbar II, who was titular ruler of the
district 1806-37.

At the meeting, on Tuesday, 15 June, a petition for free trade written
by Mill was approved. For the petition, which was printed in the Morning
Chronicle on 17 June, p. 6, see CW, Vol. V, pp. 761-3, and Vol. XXIV,
pp. 803-6. Mill “had a great share in getting up the public meeting”
(CW, Vol. XIII, p. 478), which was described in the Spectator, 19 June,
p. 580.

1
MS in the William R. Perkins Library, Duke University.

Richard Bentley (1794-1871), publisher.

Nothing is known of Mill’s earlier approach on this matter, and the
effort seems to have been fruitless.

Bassein, the 31st December, 1802,” PP, 1803-04, XII, 90-3.

1
MS in the Houghton Library, Harvard University. Dated tentatively by the
postscript. Richard Monckton Milnes, known to Mill from about 1840,
attended the meeting of the Political Economy Club (of which he never
became a member) on 3 March, 1842, when Mill, but not Buller, attended.

2
For Peacock, see Letter 237.2, above. John Forbes Royle (1799-1858),
surgeon and naturalist, who shared Mill’s botanical interests, was in
charge of East India Company correspondence relating to vegetable
production.

1
MS in the William R. Perkins Library, Duke University.

John William Parker (1792-1870), printer and publisher, who had agreed
to bring out Mill’s A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive
(published February 1843); CW, Vols. VII-VIII (Toronto: University of
Toronto Press, 1973). Parker remained Mill’s publisher until the
business was transferred to Longman in 1864.

2
In his earlier letter to Parker (CW, Vol. XIII, p. 514), Mill mentioned
“some 25 or 30 copies.”

1
MS at Kokugakuin University, Tokyo.

2
I.e., the layout of the pages for Mill’s System of Logic.

3
Sheets were sent to Armand Marrast (1801-52), who had edited La Tribune
and Le National, but whom Mill correctly thought would not complete the
work (see CW, Vol. XIII, pp. 587 and 632). No French version appeared
until 1886, when the 6th ed. was translated by Louis Peisse.

4
John Austin, then living in Prussia, had proposed to review the System
of Logic in the Edinburgh Review (see CW, Vol. XIII, pp. 527-8); he
failed to do so, and no review ever appeared in the Edinburgh.

1
MS in the possession of Professor Toshio Ohfuchi, Nihon University,
Tokyo.

2
Apparently Kemble had indicated unwillingness to publish the article,
which Mill had forwarded to him (see CW, Vol. XIII, p. 515), by John
Phillips Potter (1793-1861). He changed his mind, however, and “The
Philosophy of Socrates” appeared in the British and Foreign Review, XIV
(Feb. 1843), 289-333. The publisher was Richard Taylor (1781-1858).

1
MS in the Varnhagen von Ense Collection, Jagiellonian Library, Cracow.
Dated by the librarian.

2
Mill is replying to Carlyle’s request for autographs, on behalf of Karl
August Varnhagen von Ense (1785-1858), Prussian diplomat and biographer.
The autographs are, in addition to those identified above, of Henry
Peter Brougham (1778-1868), judge and prolific writer; Ram Mohun Roy
(1774-1833), Indian reformer, who became known to the Bentham circle
while on visits to England; Alexander Burnes (1805-41), a political
officer in India who travelled extensively, and was killed in an Afghan
uprising; Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice (1780-1863), Marquis of Lansdowne,
prominent Whig statesman; and Henry John Temple (1784-1865), Viscount
Palmerston, an even more prominent Whig politician.

1
MS in the Hill Memorial Library, Louisiana State University, Baton
Rouge. Headed in Mill’s hand: “Copy of my letter to Empson in answer to
his disclaimer of intention to offend—December 1843.”

William Empson (1791-1852), later editor of the Edinburgh Review
1847-52, author of “Jeremy Bentham,” Edinburgh Review, LXXVIII (Oct.
1843), 460-516, which provoked Mill’s “Letter to the Editor of the
Edinburgh Review on James Mill,” ibid., LXXIX (Jan. 1844), 267-71 (in
CW, Vol. I, pp. 533-8).

2
Macvey Napier (1776-1847) was then editor of the Edinburgh Review; Mill
wrote to him on 14 October, 1843, asking that a reply to Empson’s
article be printed (CW, Vol. XIII, pp. 598-9). At the end of the first
paragraph of Mill’s article, as printed, appeared: “I mean the late Mr.
James Mill, my father.” “Son” does not appear in the article, but does
in the accompanying editorial note; see CW, Vol. I, p. 536.

A copy of the letter from Hugh Stark, Assistant Secretary and Senior
Clerk in the Revenue Department, immediately precedes Mill’s in
L/P&S/6/334.

3
Above the line, in pencil, is “A,” keyed to a note at the foot of the
page, in another hand: “This is, I imagine, a mistake—five per cent is
deducted from all salaries on account of the Fund.”

4
In the same hand, interlined in pencil: “then—the other half is given
gratuitously—”.

5
Similar interlineation: “because its credit is so bad that people will
not lend to it at a lower rate.”

6
Similar interlineation: “rather, which Chundoo Loll, at that time, was
willing to promise—”.

7
Similar interlineation over the last sentence: “that is—we should make
him pay—consequently we give our guarantee—but these officers cannot be
allowed to have the advantage of both Hydrabad interest & British
security.”

MS in the Reed Collection, Dunedin Public Library, New Zealand.
Published in MNL, XXIII (Winter 1988), 23, edited by Eric W. Nye.

2
Mill had offered to Kemble the article that eventually appeared as
“Duveyrier’s Political Views of French Affairs,” not in the British and
Foreign Review but in the Edinburgh Review, LXXXIII (Apr. 1846), 435-74
(in CW, Vol. XX, pp. 295-316); see CW, Vol. XIII, pp. 627 and 632-3.

3
Mill had earlier written to Kemble to introduce David Masson
(1822-1907), a Scot who became a prominent man of letters. No article by
him appeared in the British and Foreign Review, though he proposed one
on Wallace; see CW, Vol. XIII, p. 628.

1
MS in the Yale University Library consists of a single page, containing
two extracts in an unknown hand, headed respectively, as here, “Extract
B” and “A” (see Letter 447.2 below), with a page of accounts verso.

2
This square-bracketed note by the copyist refers to the accounts.

Copyist’s note: There is no other date; but the note was clearly written
subsequently to Kindersley’s opinion.

2
Richard Torin Kindersley (1792-1879), a barrister, K.C. 1835, active in
Chancery.

1
MS in the Bodleian Library.

John Hamilton Thom (1808-94) had founded, with James Martineau and John
James Tayler, the Prospective Review in February 1845. He had previously
edited the Christian Teacher, and while that seems an unlikely place for
Mill to submit manuscripts, Thom was known to Mill through Joseph Blanco
White.

2
Not identified.

3
If the identification of Thom is correct, and if any of the “papers”
were accepted, the most likely article is “The White Lady and Undine,”
Prospective Review, I (May 1845), 275-82.

1
MS in the Pierpont Morgan Library, watermarked 1844. Since 26 August was
a Tuesday in 1845, that is the likely year.

1
MS in the Pierpont Morgan Library. Dated by a letter from Beaumont to
Alexis de Tocqueville of the same date.

Henry Reeve (1813-95), nephew of Sarah Austin, was from 1837 an official
of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

2
Gustave Auguste de Beaumont de la Bonninière (1802-66), writer on social
and political topics, was visiting London for a week or two.

3
Philip Meadows Taylor (1808-76), a cousin of Reeve’s, in the military
service of the East India Company, had been Resident in Shorapore after
pacifying it in 1841. An unsuccessful attempt was made in 1845 to
replace him as Resident by a member of the Company’s civil service. See
two earlier letters to Reeve on this matter, CW, Vol. XIII, pp. 680-1.

1
MS, in Harriet Taylor’s hand, in the possession of Professor Arnold
Heertje, University of Amsterdam.

James Hutchinson, a surgeon, may be the person addressed; he was author
of A Report of the Medical Management of the Native Jails throughout the
Territories Subject to the Governments of Fort William and Agra
(Calcutta, 1835), which was republished in 1845 as Observations on the
General and Medical Management of Indian Jails.

1
MS in the Houghton Library, Harvard University.

On 27 October, 1847, Mill had written to Parker concerning the
contractual arrangements for his Principles of Political Economy; see
CW, Vol. XIII, pp. 723-4. Another letter to Parker, in CW, Vol. XVII, p.
2006, with the conjectural date of November 1847, is evidently the first
of this series, and should probably be dated 25 October.

1
MS at University College London.

The paper is watermarked 1848, the year when Chadwick was seeking an
appointment for Alexander Bain (1818-1903), Mill’s chief Scottish
disciple, to the Metropolitan Sanitary Commission. In the absence of
other information it may be hypothesized that the reference is to Mill’s
“Bain’s On the Application of Science to Human Health and Well-being,”
Examiner, 2 Sept. 1848, p. 565 (in CW, Vol. XXV, pp. 1118-20), a
laudatory review of Bain’s On the Application of Science to Human Health
and Well-being (London and Glasgow: Griffin, 1848). Chadwick believed
that Bain’s work would help establish his credentials for the
position—which he did not receive (Bain, Autobiography [London:
Longmans, Green, 1904], p. 197n).

Frederick James Furnivall (1825-1910), scholar and editor, an active

Principles of Political Economy; CW, Vols. II-III [Toronto: University
of Toronto Press, 1965], Vol. III, pp. 758-96) for distribution among
the working classes to encourage their interest in the cooperative
movement. Mill agreed to the proposal, but wished first to “make some
little additions to the chapter, tending to increase its usefulness,”
Furnivall apparently helping with lists of existing associations. The
chapter was, in fact, never reprinted; see CW, Vol. XV, pp. 157, 159,

in fact appear until 1863. Dicey had earlier published Rome in 1860
(London: Macmillan, 1861).

The cause of the North was faring badly at this point, and The Times was

This statement in support of constitutional government in Greece may
have been solicited from Mill following the revolution in 1862 (cf. the
hope expressed in Helen Taylor’s article “Greece,” Penny Newsman, 22
Mar., 1863, p. 1, that the result would be “the establishment of a good
and popular government”); or it may date from the end of 1864, when the
recently installed King of the Hellenes, George I, was forced to accept
an ultrademocratic constitution, drawn up by the National Assembly.

Plummer had won first prize of £30 in a national mechanics’ essay
competition organized by the Rev. J.P. Gell of Notting Hill, London. His
views are summed up in the title of his essay: Our Colonies: An Essay on
the Advantages Accruing to the British Nation, from Its Possession of
the Colonies, Considered Economically, Politically and Morally (London,
Kettering, and Sydney, 1864). On 6 March, 1864, Mill wrote to Plummer:
“I like your Essay on the Colonies very much, though I do not go the
length of all you say respecting their advantages” (CW, Vol. XV, p.
923).

5
Goldwin Smith (1823-1910) published a series of letters in the Daily
News in 1862-63 advocating independence for the colonies. These were
revised in an attempt to add consistency to their arguments, and
published as The Empire (Oxford and London: Henry and Parker, 1863). On
8 November, 1864, Mill wrote to J.E. Cairnes, “I do not at all agree
with Goldwin Smith in thinking the severance actually desirable” (CW,
Vol. XV, p. 965).

6
Mill and Helen Taylor were at Blackheath again on 17 February, 1864 (CW,

application of mathematics to logic by George Boole (1815-64), late
Professor of Mathematics at Queen’s College, Cork, especially in his An
Investigation of the Laws of Thought, on Which Are Founded the
Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities (London: Walton and

4
Augustus De Morgan (1806-70), Professor of Mathematics at University
College London 1828-31 and 1836-66, was a friend and correspondent of
Mill. De Morgan’s most important work in this area was Formal Logic; or,
The Calculus of Inference, Necessary and Probable (London: Taylor and
Walton, 1847), which Mill criticized, on these same grounds, in his
System of Logic, CW, Vol. VII, pp. 171n-2n.

Mill may have in mind, in addition to Jevons and De Morgan, John Venn
(1834-1923), Lecturer in Moral Science at Gonville and Caius College,
Cambridge, since 1862.

On behalf of the Committee working to elect Mill as M.P. for
Westminster, its Chairman, Charles Westerton (1813-72), bookseller and
librarian, had written to overcome Mill’s reluctance to appear before
the electors. See Mill’s reply of 26 June, 1865, CW, Vol. XVI, pp.
1073-4.

2
There was no action then in parliament concerning the abolition of rules
for excluding evidence in the courts. Mill’s allegiance to the cause
dates back to his editing of Jeremy Bentham’s Rationale of Judicial
Evidence (1827); see the Introduction to CW, Vol. XXXI, pp. xv-xix.

The Daily Telegraph, with most of the British press, supported Edward

insurrection of 1865 and punished its leaders; see “The Negro
Insurrection,” and “Governor Eyre,” Daily Telegraph, 29 and 30 Nov.,
1865, both p. 3.

Eyre’s “boast” is in his “Despatch to the Rt. Hon. Edward Cardwell,
M.P.” (20 Oct., 1865), PP, 1866, LI, 158. For Mill’s account of the
other “authorities,” see his speech of 19 July, 1866, “The Disturbances
in Jamaica [1],” CW, Vol. XXVIII, pp. 93-5. In July Mill would become
the Chairman of the Jamaica Committee, dedicated to bringing Eyre to
trial.

MS in the Pierpont Morgan Library.

2
Probably the leading article on secular education for Ireland, Scotsman,
29 Jan., 1866, p. 2. At this time, Mill, with John Elliot Cairnes the
initiator of the effort, was preparing for a struggle in parliament to
defend the nondenominational Queen’s University in Ireland (a group of
three Colleges) from a government scheme that would have crippled it by
allowing Catholics to obtain degrees without an attendance requirement.
See esp. Mill’s letter to Cairnes of 6 January, 1866, CW, Vol. XVI, pp.
1133-4, in which he asks about Neate’s view of the question. For a full
discussion, see Bruce L. Kinzer, “John Stuart Mill and the Irish
University Question,” Victorian Studies, XXXI (Autumn 1987), 59-77.

MS in the Osborn Collection, Yale University.

Ralph Bernal Osborne (1811-82), liberal M.P. for various constituencies
1841-65, and Secretary to the Admiralty 1852-58, had been defeated in
the general election in July 1865. He was elected in a by-election for
Nottingham in April 1866. If the letter is indeed to him, it would seem
likely that it dates from the first months of the parliamentary session
in 1866, when Osborne might have wanted a “gallery order” so that he
could follow the debate in the Commons during the brief period when he
was not in the House.

The request may well pertain to the scheduled debate on habeas corpus in
Ireland, Saturday, 17 February.

1
MS at the College of Law, Nihon University, Tokyo.

2
Count Adam Gurowski (1805-66), exiled Polish author and agitator, with
whom Mill had become acquainted in Paris in the 1830s, emigrated to the
United States in 1849. The first two volumes of his Diary had been
published in America (Boston: Lee and Shepard, 1862; New York: Carleton,
1864). Gurowski had sent Mill a proof copy of Vol. III before its
publication (New York: Morrison, 1866). Mill declined either to edit an
English edition or to write an introduction to it (see CW, Vol. XVI, pp.
1113-14), and no English edition appears to have been published.

3
This paragraph is cancelled in the MS, possibly by the clerk who filled
the order, and noted the transaction with his initials and the date, 21
Feb., 1866.

The most recent editions were, of the Principles, the 6th (1865), of On
Liberty, the 3rd (1864), and of Representative Government, the 3rd

John Nicolaus Trübner (1817-84), publisher, author, and translator, then
publisher of the Westminster Review, and consequently of Mill’s Auguste
Comte and Positivism (1865), was identified as the probable agent for
transmitting books in a letter of this date (CW, Vol. XVI, pp. 1158-9)
from Mill to Samuel Sullivan Cox (1824-89), tariff reformer, formerly
Democratic Congressman from Ohio.

2
These, as the letter to Cox indicates, concerned the operation of free
trade in the U.K., and were supplied by William Newmarch (1820-82),
economist and statistician; the only title Mill specifies is Newmarch’s
“Commercial History and Review of 1865,” “Supplement to the Economist,”
XXIV (10 Mar., 1866), 1-64.

It is not known what Smith had mentioned; when the issue arose in the
Commons, Mill made no reference to the matter.

1
MS in the Houghton Library, Harvard University.

2
Holmes did not meet Spencer (see Howe, Justice Holmes, Vol. I, p. 226).

3
On Tuesday, 11 June, Holmes dined in the Members’ Room of the Commons
with Mill and Alexander Bain (ibid., p. 228).

1
MS in the James Beal Collection at the Greater London Record Office.

James Beal (1829-91), auctioneer and land agent, who had led the
movement to elect Mill, was particularly concerned about municipal
reform.

2
Mill was a member of the Select Committee on Metropolitan Local
Government, which began to hear evidence on 9 March, 1866. William
Edward Hickson (see Letter 277.2 above) appeared before the Committee on
26 July, when he was questioned by Mill. See the Committee’s “Second
Report,” PP, 1866, XIII, 569-85. (Mill’s part of the questioning is in
CW, Vol. XXIX, pp. 536-8.) The previous evidence that Hickson wished to
see is in the “First Report,” PP, 1866, XIII, 171-315.

3
Acton Smee Ayrton (1816-86), barrister, M.P. for Tower Hamlets 1857-74,
chaired the Committee on Metropolitan Government.

4
Presumably a committee of St. James’s Vestry, on which Beal was active.

5
The Liberal Reform Bill (see Letter 949A above) was before the House
from 14 March, with frequent crucial debates. The Bill was finally
withdrawn on 20 July, and the Conservatives consequently formed a new
administration.

6
Thomas Beggs (1808-96), an engineer and brass founder, temperance
advocate and political reformer, was allied with Beal in Mill’s election
campaign. He had appeared before the Metropolitan Local Government
Committee on 26 April and 10 May; see PP, 1866, XIII, 367-73 and 374-8.
(Mill’s part of the questioning is in CW, Vol. XXIX, pp. 471-6.)

Paris, but it lasted only until the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War;
see also CW, Vol. XVI, pp. 1087, 1092.

1
MS in the Osborn Collection, Yale University.

It is likely that Mill is acknowledging royalty payments for his works;
see his letter of 28 April, 1866, to Longman (CW, Vol. XVI, p. 1161). At
this time, Mill commonly dated brief notes simply “Blackheath,” with
month and day.

Walter Lowe Clay (1833-75), Church of England divine, sometime chaplain
of Preston Gaol, and writer on prisons.

2
When the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science met in
Birmingham in October, there was no session devoted to extradition
treaties. In parliament, Mill had been successful in limiting to one
year the application of 29 & 30 Victoria, c. 121 (10 Aug., 1866), the
Act amending the law relating to extradition; later, in 1868, he was an
active member of the Select Committee on Extradition (see CW, Vol. XXIX,
pp. 542-71).

3
The public issue Mill was most involved in was the controversy over
ex-Governor Eyre of Jamaica. His pressing authorial work was the 3rd ed.
of An Examination of Sir William Hamilton’s Philosophy (CW, Vol. IX) and
his Inaugural Address at St. Andrews (in CW, Vol. XXI, pp. 215-57).

1
MS at Kwanseigakuin University, Nishinomiya, Japan.

Elizabeth Malleson (née Whitehead) (1828-1916), wife of Frank Rodbard
Malleson, had founded the Working Women’s College two years earlier. For
the prospectus, and her inaugural address on the occasion, see the
English Woman’s Journal, XIII (Aug. 1864), 430-2 (in which Mill is
mentioned as a subscriber), and Address at the Opening of the Working
Women’s College, October 26th, 1864 (London: Kenney, 1868).

John Morley (1838-1923), editor and author, later statesman, met Mill in
1866, and became intimate in subsequent months (see his Recollections, 2
vols. [New York: Macmillan, 1917], Vol. I, p. 52), before taking a trip
to the U.S.A. in the winter of 1867-68.

1
MS in the Houghton Library, Harvard University.

The reporter is unidentified.

2
Mill delivered his Rectorial Address at St. Andrews University on 1
February, and it was reported in full in the Scottish and national press
before its publication as a book later that month. How he could arrange
for a printed text to reach Glasgow on the day of the speech’s delivery
is not known; the account in the Herald (2 Feb., p. 6), while
substantial and close to the book version, omits central paragraphs.

MS in the University Library, Cambridge.

John Malcolm Forbes Ludlow (1821-1911), lawyer, author, and social

2
Benjamin Scott (1814-92), Chamberlain of the City of London, was to
testify before the Select Committee on Metropolitan Government, of which
Mill was a member, on 6 and 28 March, and 1, 11, and 30 April, 1867, as
he had in the previous year. For Scott’s exchanges with Mill, see CW,
Vol. XXXI, pp. 390-1, 402-4, and Vol. XXIX, pp. 443-4.

Andrea Crestadoro (1808-79), a bibliographer, had been appointed chief
librarian of the Manchester Public Free Libraries.

2
Crestadoro had prepared an Index-Catalogue of the Hulme Lending Branch
of the Manchester Public Free Libraries (Manchester, 1867).

3
The Index-Catalogue indicates that the Library already had On Liberty,
Principles of Political Economy, and Considerations on Representative
Government.

4
Among “others,” Mill was probably planning to send the 2nd eds. of
Dissertations and Discussions and of the Inaugural Address and the 3rd
ed. of the Examination, all of which appeared in the spring of 1867.

1
MS at the College of Law, Nihon University, Tokyo.

2
Graham had evidently asked Mill to be surety for a debt; see CW, Vol.
XVI, pp. 1286 and 1296, and Vol. XVII, p. 1602.

3
Graham was retiring as Registrar-General of Births and Deaths, a
position he had held since 1838.

1
MS at the College of Law, Nihon University, Tokyo.

Henry Studdy Theobald (1847-1934), was then a student at Oxford, and
later a lawyer and author. His father, William, an old friend of Mill’s,
was also an author of legal works, and a member of the Calcutta bar.

2
The accompanying note, of 28 March, 1867, to Gustave d’Eichthal
(1804-86), an early disciple of Saint-Simon, and friend of Mill’s from
1828, is in CW, Vol. XVI, p. 1261.

1
MS in the James Beal Collection at the Greater London Record Office.

Mill was still in London on 11 April, when he attended a meeting of the

copies of the evidence given to the Committee up to that date. For the
evidence, see the Committee’s “Third Report,” PP, 1867, XII, 443-600.

On 30 April the Committee met, Mill present, and debated Resolutions;
these were revised in subsequent meetings and the final version was
agreed on 6 May, with a short report. See the Committee’s “Second
Report,” ibid., pp. 435-41*.

On 13 May Mill moved for leave to introduce “A Bill for the
Establishment of Municipal Corporations within the Metropolis,” 30
Victoria (21 May, 1867), PP, 1867, IV, 447-66, and announced that he
would later bring forward “A Bill for the Better Government of the
Metropolis,” 30 & 31 Victoria (6 Aug., 1867), ibid., 215-56. Both Bills
were drafted by Beal, with assistance from Ludlow; see Letter 1112A
below. Mill’s speeches of 21 May and 7 August, introducing the measures,
are in CW, Vol. XXVIII, pp. 162-5 and 230-1.

Henry Sidgwick (1838-1900), a graduate and fellow of Trinity College
Cambridge, classicist and philosopher, was experiencing religious
difficulties, especially over the question of subscription to the
Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England. He wrote to Mill, as a
stranger, on 28 July, 1867 (MS at Johns Hopkins), explaining his
problems in attempting, on “principles of ethics,” to write about the
position liberals “ought to take up with regard to the traditional . . .
religion of the country.” He asked if Mill could devote time to “viva
voce” discussion or to reading his “statement” on the subject. The
latter presumably was a draft of The Ethics of Conformity and
Subscription (London: Williams and Norgate, 1870). See Letter 1160A
below.

Thomas Joseph Haslam (1825-1917), an Irish Quaker, was an advocate of
birth control and of repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. His wife
Anna Maria (née Fisher) (ca. 1830-after 1918) an advocate of women’s
suffrage, had signed the petition on the subject presented by Mill to
the Commons in 1866.

2
Presumably these were written, not printed, reports by Haslam and
Richard Davis Webb (d. 1872), a Dublin printer and Quaker, who was
prominent in anti-slavery, temperance, and peace campaigns in Ireland.
He joined the Suffrage Society but not the Committee (see Mill’s letter
to Cairnes, of 1 September, 1867, CW, Vol. XVI, p. 1315).

3
The Executive Committee of the London National Society for Women’s
Suffrage included at that time Clementia Taylor (1811-1908), wife of
Peter Alfred Taylor; Millicent Fawcett (1811-1929), wife of Henry
Fawcett; Frances Power Cobbe (1822-1902), philanthropist and religious
writer; Margaret Lucas (1818-90), wife of Samuel Lucas, the journalist,
and sister of John and Jacob Bright; and Katherine Hare, daughter of
Thomas Hare.

In the introduction to his translation of Ernst Kuno Berthold Fischer
(1824-1907), German Hegelian, A Commentary on Kant’s Critique of Pure
Reason (London: Longmans, Green, 1866), Mahaffy had criticized Mill on
“the doctrine of Permanent Possibilities, and the subject of Necessary
Truths,” as Mill indicated in the 3rd ed. of An Examination of Sir
William Hamilton’s Philosophy; see CW, Vol. IX, p. civ.

translating the Inaugural Address (London: Longmans, et al., 1867). In
the event, Dohrn waived his right (see CW, Vol. XVI, p. 1391), and Adolf
Wahrmund translated the work as Rectoratsrede, gehalten an der St.
Andrews Universität, in Theodor Gomperz’s edition of Mill’s writings,

at the time, he was in Blackheath, and was thinking of the edition of
his father’s Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind, which appeared
in 1869. There is reference in it to the Theory of Moral Sentiments
(1759), by Adam Smith (1723-90), the Scottish economist and philosopher;

Dated to 1868 by the reference to the Provisional Committee. On 29
February, 1868, Mill attended a conference at the offices of the Reform
League, Edmond Beales in the chair, at which it was agreed that, with
Hare’s assistance, a pamphlet should be prepared, giving a simple
explanatory statement of his system of proportional representation. At a
subsequent meeting on 13 June, which Mill was not able to attend, a
committee was established with the aim of founding an association to
collect and disseminate information on ways of improving representative
government by reorganizing constituencies. See The Times, 2 March, and
15 June, both p. 5.

1
MS not located. Quoted from the catalogue of Elkin Mathews Ltd., [1941].
Dated by reference to the first consideration of the “extradition
report” by the Select Committee on 2 July, at which both James Stansfeld
(1820-98) and Mill were present.

Peter Alfred Taylor (1819-91), radical M.P. for Leicester 1862-84, was
allied with Mill on such major issues as women’s suffrage, the Jamaica
Committee, and anti-slavery.

2
For the Committee’s report, see PP, 1867-68, VII, 129-336; for Mill’s
involvement, see CW, Vol. XXIX, pp. 542-71.

3
The catalogue reads “pass,” but it seems more likely that Mill had
failed to get a “pair,” and so was obliged to attend the House to vote
on the agreement to second reading of “A Bill to Repeal Certain Tests
and Alter Certain Statutes Affecting the Constitution of the
Universities of Oxford and Cambridge,” PP, 1867-68, III, 589-92; see PD,
3rd ser., Vol. 193, col. 471.

Gladstone, the Liberal leader, soon to be Prime Minister, was standing
for two seats, in South Lancashire (his former constituency) and
Greenwich. It was understood that if elected for the former, where a
stiff fight was occurring, he would sit for it, and relinquish the
latter. John Baxter Langley, a writer on life insurance and railways,
had withdrawn as a Liberal candidate in Greenwich to make Gladstone’s
election easier. In the event, Gladstone lost in South Lancashire, but
was elected for Greenwich.

Caroline Lindley, a neighbour of Mill’s at Blackheath and a frequent
correspondent of Helen Taylor’s 1866-82, was active in the establishment
of a Birkbeck school at Hethersett, Norfolk, in 1855.

2
These schools, named for George Birkbeck (1776-1841), founder of the
Mechanics’ Institutions, were first established in 1848 by Mill’s
friend, William Ellis. The curriculum emphasized science and utilitarian
economics. At one time there were seven schools in London, and others in
the provinces.

3
Mill had returned to London for the election campaign early in November,
leaving Helen in Avignon.

George Washburn Smalley (1833-1916), foreign correspondent of the New

1867-95. Smalley’s reply to this letter is at Johns Hopkins; for Mill’s
reply to it, see CW, Vol. XVII, p. 1541.

2
Mill’s open support for Edwin Chadwick as a Liberal candidate in
Kilmarnock greatly offended Edward Pleydell Bouverie (1818-89), a
sitting Liberal member, one of the “Adullamites” who had opposed
Gladstone’s Reform Bill. Bouverie admonished Mill in a letter, and when
Mill responded, published the correspondence in the national press (see
The Times, 16 Oct., p. 10). The Daily News, which also printed the
correspondence on 16 Oct., published leading articles on the controversy
on 21 Oct., p. 4, and 23 Oct., p. 4. These are much more favourable to
Mill than his comment implies, the second explicitly blaming Bouverie
for publishing the correspondence without Mill’s approval. For the full
correspondence, see CW, Vol. XVI, pp. 1453-4 and 1460-4, and Vol. XXV,
p. 1220.

This is the statement “in the form of a letter” that Mill refers to in
his covering letter to Chapman of 27 December, 1868 (CW, Vol. XVI, pp.
1532-3). Mill said that Chapman could “shew” this, but “did not wish it
to be published”; see also ibid., p. 1544, to Chapman.

1221-2. A leading article on the case of Constable William Smith had
appeared in Daily News, 18 Jan., 1870, pp. 4-5. Smith was dismissed from
the force and given a month’s hard labour for using what the magistrate,
Ralph Augustus Benson (1828-86), deemed excessive force in protecting a
woman abused by her husband; see The Times, 25 Dec., 1869, p. 9.

Emile Louis Victor, baron de Laveleye (1822-92), Belgian political
economist, whose work Mill much admired.

2
Cairnes, who was preparing “Our Defences: A National or a Standing
Army,” Fortnightly Review, n.s. IX (Feb. 1871), 167-98, had apparently
wanted to consult Laveleye’s series of articles entitled “L’Allemagne
depuis la guerre de 1866,” which had appeared in the Revue des Deux
Mondes (Feb. 1867-Oct. 1869), reprinted as La Prusse et l’Autriche
depuis Sadowa, 2 vols. (Paris: Hachette, 1870). Laveleye seems to have
provided the volume, which Cairnes cited, pp. 175n, 176, and 187-8.

Cairnes also cited articles in Annales de l’Association Internationale
pour le Progrès des Sciences Sociales (Paris, Brussels, 1866),
acknowledging Laveleye’s suggestion, p. 189n.

Arthur Patchett Martin (1851-1902), Australian author, journalist, and
civil servant.

2
Charles Gavan Duffy (1816-1903), a “Young Irelander” who had founded the
Nation in 1842 and tried to persuade Mill to stand for an Irish
constituency in 1851, emigrated to Australia in 1856, where he became
prominent politically. He was Chief Secretary (i.e., head of government)
of Victoria 1871-72.

Women were admitted to the Junior and Senior Examinations at Sydney in
1871 (W. Vere Hole and Anne H. Treweeke, The History of the Women’s

6
The first woman student graduated from the Law Department of the
University of Chicago in June 1870. (The Department later became the
Union College of Law, and relocated as the Law Department at
Northwestern University, after the first University of Chicago dissolved
in 1886.)

7
John H. Howe (d. 1873) was quoted to this effect in the new organ of the
National American Woman Suffrage Association, Woman’s Journal, I (23
Apr., 1870), 123. T.A. Larsen, History of Wyoming (Lincoln: University
of Nebraska Press, 1965), pp. 84-5, says that, following the granting of
suffrage to women in 1869, they served on juries in 1870 and 1871, but
then were not called, on the ground that the suffrage did not entail
such service.

8
Henry Keylock Rusden (1826-1910), an author and civil servant in
Victoria, had corresponded with Mill.

2
The 7th ed. appeared in 1871. It is a matter of judgment whether there
are almost no changes in it, but there are few compared to those in
other editions; see the Textual Introduction, CW, Vol. II, pp. lxix ff.

1
MS draft in the Mill-Taylor Collection, British Library of Political and
Economic Science, in reply to Herbert’s of 26 December, 1871, also in

as is the letter of 29 January published in CW, Vol. XVII, pp. 1869-71,
of which this appears to be an earlier draft.

At 226 rue de Rivoli, Paris. As Mill was in Dijon on 6 February, and in
Montbard, only a few kilometers to the northwest on the 8th (presumably
travelling by boat on the Burgundy canal), it would appear that his
plans changed, and perhaps this reservation was never made.

Leonard Henry Courtney (1832-1918), later Baron Courtney of Penrith, a
lawyer and journalist who favoured reform of endowments, was Professor

1
MS at University College London. Between 1834 and 1846, Chadwick, as
Secretary to the Poor Law Commission, was the Chief Executive Officer
under the Poor Law Amendment Act. In this capacity, his signature was
sufficient to send letters free in England. It is reasonable to assume
that this request came early in his tenure, before he learned the
intricacies of the perquisite system.

1
MS in the Keynes Collection, King’s College, Cambridge. Addressed: J.T.
Leader Esq. M.P. / 8 Stratton Street.

John Temple Leader (1810-1903), one of the active Philosophic Radicals
in the post-Reform parliament, was M.P. for Bridgenorth 1835-37 and for
Westminster 1837-47. As he had not yet met William Johnson Fox
(1786-1864), the Unitarian clergyman, editor and author, an intimate
friend of Mill’s, one may infer that the letter dates from the earliest
days of Leader’s parliamentary career.

1
MS in the Varnhagen von Ense Collection, Jagiellonian Library, Cracow.

2
Presumably the reference is to Henry Samuel Chapman (1803-81), a

Stone has not been identified, nor has the “matter” in question. Mill in
general was absent from the India Office for extended periods only in
the summer months. The wording also suggests that the letter was written
