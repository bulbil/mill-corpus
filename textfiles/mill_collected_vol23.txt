August 1831 to July 1832


113.: FRENCH NEWS [24]
 EXAMINER, 21 AUG., 1831, P. 538

Mill here resumes his regular comments on French political affairs, his
last article having been on 24 Apr. (No. 102). Described in Mill’s
bibliography as “A short summary of French affairs in the Examiner of
21st August 1831” (MacMinn, p. 17), the unheaded item is listed as
“Article on France” and enclosed in square brackets in the Somerville
College set.

the french chamber of deputies has continued, during the whole of the
last week the important debate on the address.1 Several orators of
considerable ability have appeared among the new members; and several of
those who had already distinguished themselves have signalized the
present discussion by some of their most successful efforts.

The debate, too, comprehends every topic, both of internal and foreign
policy; and contributes greatly to make known, and in no small degree
probably even to form, the political views which will predominate in the
conduct of the new Chamber.

We shall wait for the termination of this discussion, before we offer to
our readers the facts which it discloses, and the observations which it
suggests. Few debates, within our recollection, have been calculated to
suggest so many; few have afforded so complete a picture of the
situation of parties, and the state of the public mind, or such abundant
materials for conjectures diving deep into futurity.

The discussion has been stormy; the natural consequence, among an
excitable people, of the arrival of two hundred new deputies unused to
the forms of debate, and the violent passions excited by a division of
parties so nearly equal as to afford a hope of victory to each on every
division.

It is not often that we have had it in our power to applaud the articles
of the Times on foreign affairs, and we have the greater pleasure in
referring to that of Edition: current; Page: [336] Friday last, in which
the sitting of the Monday preceding, the most tempestuous of all, is
commented upon with great good sense, and in the best spirit.2


114.: STATE OF PARTIES IN FRANCE
 EXAMINER, 28 AUG., 1831, PP. 545-6

This article, headed as title, begins the “Political Examiner.”
Described in Mill’s bibliography as “An article headed ‘State of Parties
in France’ in the Examiner of 28th August 1831” (MacMinn, p. 17), it is
listed as title and enclosed in square brackets in the Somerville
College set.

of the four hundred and fifty-nine members of the late Chamber of
Deputies, two hundred have not been re-elected: and although several of
these will obtain seats in the new Chamber by means of the vacancies
occasioned by the double, triple, and quadruple returns, the change is
sufficient to render the present legislature of France essentially a new
body.

This renovation is most auspicious to the tranquility and improvement of
France, and of all Europe. It is far more than was anticipated from the
very limited constituency by which the French Parliament is even now
elected; and it is sufficient to induce us to desire, that the people of
France may rest satisfied with their present electoral qualification for
some time longer, and postpone any further extension of popular rights,
until the great step which their institutions have now made, shall have
had leisure to produce its fruits.

A body, which in so large a proportion consists of new members, who have
never before figured in politics, and are not yet pledged to any
specific course of public measures, was not likely to assume a very
decided character all at once. The majority in the New Chamber has
hitherto been a fluctuating one; but it is ascertained that the Liberal
party has sufficiently increased in strength, to influence, though not
to govern, the decisions of the entire body; and that all propositions,
tending to the removal of defects, and the introduction of progressive
improvements in the institutions and social condition of France, will
meet with a far more favourable reception from the present Chamber than
from the last.

This large increase in the strength of the popular party has not been
furnished, agreeably to the trite generalities of common-place politics,
by the great towns and manufacturing districts. These, in France, are
the seats of the wealthy and pusillanimous, and in these, consequently,
the popular party has sustained numerous defeats; in Paris itself they
have decidedly lost ground, and of the great cities, Strasbourg is the
only one where the elections have gone wholly in their favour. As we are
writing this, we perceive that the contrary proposition has been
Edition: current; Page: [337] put forth in the British Parliament with
an innocent naïveté of self-complacency, which irresistibly invites us
to quote. In the House of Commons, on Wednesday last, according to the
Times newspaper, Mr. Praed delivered himself as follows:

His historical studies had convinced him, that at all times, and in all
nations, the inhabitants of towns had been prone to support, and the
inhabitants of the country prone to oppose, all kinds of innovation. No
man had analyzed so closely as he had the constitution of the present
Chamber of Deputies in France, and he saw invariably that it was the
Deputy for the vineyard and the corn-field that opposed, and the Deputy
for the manufactory and the workshop that supported, the party of the
movement.1

Perhaps this Senator, who in the prosecution of his “historical
studies,” has “analyzed so closely the constitution of the present
Chamber of Deputies,” will condescend to substantiate the accuracy of
his analysis by accounting for the following facts:

That three of the four Members for Lyons, three of the four Members for
Bordeaux, two of the three Members for Rouen, two of the three Members
for Metz, the Member for Havre, the Member for St. Etienne, both the
Members for Arras, and two of the three Members for Nantes,* belong to
the Ministerial, or stationary party:

That the manufacturing departments of Artois and Flanders return twenty
Deputies, of whom five only belong to the popular party:

That the department of Seine-Inférieure, the principal seat of
manufactures in the North of France, returns eleven Deputies, of whom at
least eight are ministerial: while the other three departments of the
same province (Normandy) which are chiefly agricultural, return
twenty-two Deputies, of whom all except seven belong to the opposition:

That the Member for Beaune is M. Mauguin, and that the departments of
Côte d’Or and Saône-et-Loire, comprising the ancient Burgundy, and
electing twelve Deputies, have furnished only four to the Ministerial
benches:

And, finally, that the south and west of France, the most peculiarly
agricultural districts, return a decided majority of Members belonging
to the popular party. Thus the Pyrénées-Orientales return three
Deputies, Landes three, Ariège three, all on the popular side: Gers,
four out of five; Gard, four out of five; Aude, three, if not four, out
of five; Var, three out of five; Isère, five out of seven; Dordogne,
five out of seven; Charente-Inférieure, six out of seven; Tarn, four out
of five; Vendée, we believe, all five; Vienne, four out of five;
Haute-Vienne, all five; Deux-Sèvres, three out of four. When Mr. Praed
shall have explained all this, we will allow him to make what he can of
the elections for Champagne and the Gironde, the only conspicuous cases
in accordance with his theory.

Edition: current; Page: [338]
The notion that there is an innovating tendency in manufactures and
trade, while agriculture is essentially conservative, belongs to a mind
accustomed to look at history only in the gross, without any capacity
for scrutiny and analysis; and disappears on a more accurate sifting of
the very facts which have suggested the theory. The principle of
improvement in modern Europe has had its source in the towns, only
because in them security and personal freedom were earliest enjoyed:
resistance to innovation has generally been headed by the proprietors of
the land, only because the institutions on which it was proposed to
innovate, were usually of their making and for their advantage. It
always affords a strong presumption of political quackery, to announce a
principle of politics as true “at all times and in all nations;” but it
may safely be set up, not as a universal but a very general truth, that
the tendency to keep things as they are, prevails chiefly not among the
town or the country population in particular, but among the wealthy:
those who have most to lose and least to gain; those who have thriven
under existing arrangements, and cannot be sure that they shall thrive
equally if these arrangements are altered. And this conservative
tendency (as it is called) belongs perhaps more strongly to
manufacturing and commercial, than even to landed wealth; because the
former descriptions of property are more precarious in their nature,
more dependant for their value on general tranquillity, and more exposed
even to total destruction. And hence, no doubt, it is, that in the great
seats of French manufactures and commerce, the elections have for the
most part afforded to the statu quo party the signal triumph evidenced
by the facts which we have cited above.

The people of England must seek other informants than those in whom they
at present trust, if they would understand the real character of the two
great parties between whom the political public of France is at present
divided.

There are thousands of good easy people who are simple enough to
believe, that the whole of the opposition to the present Ministry of
France consists of Republicans and Bonapartists. Now, the Bonapartists
have for the most part far too much of the wisdom of this world, to
place themselves in opposition to any Government; certainly not to that
of Louis-Philippe, who being afraid of them, as he is afraid of all
things whatsoever, made sure of them from the first, by scattering among
them, with a lavish hand, places and honours. And as for the Republicans
(though a great noise is kept up about them by the King and the
Ministry, in order to make a bulwark for themselves of the superstitious
terror which that word excites in the minds of the French nation), they
are really very few in number; not accustomed to act in concert,
confined almost entirely to Paris, consisting principally of very young
men, and not likely, unless aided by some grievous blunder of the
Government, to have any echo in France for many years to come. The
Opposition party, on the contrary, is powerful and united, strong in the
fame and abilities of its Parliamentary leaders, strong in its alliance
with the prevailing tendencies of the national mind: long since
predominant in Edition: current; Page: [339] the press and in the
nation; already of equal strength, and certain to be soon a majority, in
the strong-hold of its adversaries, the Chamber of Deputies.

It would give a very inadequate conception of the fundamental difference
between the Ministerial party and the Opposition, were we merely to
enumerate the acts, or state the professed principles, of either. The
questions are but few, which there has yet been time to discuss, or on
which they have made up their minds; and yet, whatever subject of debate
may arise,—from the difference in their habitual feelings and modes of
thinking it would not be difficult to predict which side they would
respectively espouse. The leading minds on both sides have fixed
principles, and systematically consistent opinions: but who is so wild
as to inquire the fixed principles of five hundred men? In the age we
live in, men class themselves according to their instincts, and not to
their creeds: men’s characters are not determined by their opinions, but
their opinions by their characters. The ministerial party is mainly
governed by the instinct of conservation, the opposition by the instinct
of progression. Dread of innovation is the strongest feeling in the one,
desire of improvement in the other. They cannot be more happily
characterized than by their current denominations, the party of
Movement, and that of Resistance.

The stationary party, grouped round the King and the present Prime
Minister,2 are anxious to keep all things unchanged, or to change as
little as possible. Had it depended upon them, the nation must have been
contented with a far smaller extension of the elective franchise: most
of them voted against the principal clauses of the recent election law.3
They are mostly strong adherents of the hereditary peerage. They are
averse to all further extension of popular privileges; averse to war,
less on its own account, than because it would be a change; and enemies
of the press, because it is perpetually thwarting their favourite
purpose by calling for change.

The progressive party was that which extorted from the Government the
recent change in the election law; and is about to extort from it, to
its great displeasure, the abolition of a hereditary peerage.4 From them
proceed the demands for complete liberty of the press, and its
enfranchisement from the oppressive taxes, by which, as in our own
country, it is almost weighed down. They it is who demand the abolition
of the numerous monopolies, which restrain the free employment of
industry in the interior of France. They are the most zealous advocates
of popular municipal institutions, for managing the local concerns of
the town or of the department. From them, too, proceeds the demand for
abolishing the despotic surveillance which the government exercises over
all Edition: current; Page: [340] places of education. They alone have
manifested any real sympathy with the most numerous and poorest class:
they alone have shown any disposition to retrenchment, or to altering
the taxes so as to alleviate their pressure upon those least able to
bear them; and it was they who caused to be inserted in the Address, a
promise, though a distant and conditional one, of elementary education
to be provided for the poorest classes at the public charge.5 They, too,
are those who sympathise the most strongly with the oppressed patriots
of foreign countries: and it is chiefly here that there is any danger
lest they should drive their country into measures which, however
generously intended, would be perilous to the progress of civilization
and of the spirit of freedom in France and in Europe, which at this
period, demands, above all other requisites, peace and tranquillity.

This is the party which, by the recent elections, is now barely not a
majority in the new Chamber of Deputies. And until the national mind is
formed by discussion and education, to a calmer and more practical
weighing of public questions than it has yet proved itself to be capable
of, there is perhaps nothing better to be hoped, than that the
progressive and the conservative spirit, which fail to be properly
tempered with one another in each individual mind, should yet be so
equally distributed through the whole body, as to afford hope that
between opposite passions reason may generally hold the balance. That it
will be so, there are many gratifying indications, in the votes, and the
general spirit of the new Chamber.

The progressive party are now sure of ultimate preponderance; for every
month strengthens their hold upon the national mind, and every death or
resignation which gives a younger deputy for an older, or one who is new
to public life for one who is already committed, affords them a chance
of an additional adherent. More rapid progress than this we do not
desire for them; nor if they are wise, will they wish it for themselves.
It is not always advisable that the strong should exert their strength,
however conscious of a good cause. Great changes should not be made at
the first moment when a bare majority can be obtained for them. The
idlest fears, the most unfounded dislikes, must have some time allowed
them to wear off. Nothing which can be gained by a slight acceleration
of the improvement of institutions, is an equivalent for the danger
incurred when they improve faster than the minds of a large and powerful
part of the nation.

We now feel assured, that even the present ministry will not be allowed
to carry on the government in a stationary spirit: that concessions, far
beyond what seemed probable six months ago, must be made, and made
continually, to the demands of the age for improvement: and, certain of
this, we are not anxious that changes, even the safest in themselves,
should take place with a rapidity Edition: current; Page: [341] alarming
to the timid—that is, to the great majority of the possessors of
considerable property. Nor have we any apprehension that the leaders of
the popular party will urge its demands too impetuously, unless pressed
forward with heedless violence by injudicious adherents out of doors. On
the contrary, we perceive with pleasure, and if the phrase may be
permitted us, with pride,—that while those who call themselves the
moderate party have too often displayed an irritability and intemperance
which has fixed on them the soubriquet of hommes furieux de modération,6
the popular leaders maintain, and have maintained throughout, a dignity,
a calmness, and a forbearance, which entitles them, and them only, to
the praise of genuine and honourable moderation. The two speeches of
their principal orator, M. Odilon Barrot, in the discussion on the
address, are not only temperate and conciliating in expression and tone,
but he who can read them and ascribe violent sentiments or exaggeratedly
democratic opinions to this wise and eloquent patriot, must have come
predetermined to interpret the mind of an opponent in the spirit of his
own perverseness.7


115.: THE PEERAGE QUESTION IN FRANCE
 EXAMINER, 4 SEPT., 1831, PP. 563-4

The article, headed as title, appears in the “Political Examiner,” and
is described in Mill’s bibliography as “An article headed ‘The Peerage
Question in France’ in the Examiner of 4th September 1831” (MacMinn, p.
17). It is listed as title and enclosed in square brackets in the
Somerville College set; that edition includes the subheading, “(From a
Correspondent),” that is not in other sets.

the french ministry has proposed the abolition of the Hereditary
Peerage.1

M. Casimir Périer does not disguise that this is a concession, extorted
from him, contrary to his individual inclinations, by the spirit of the
times. This avowal has brought upon him the severe reprehension of the
more vehement partisans on both sides. They treat him as one who
abandons his political creed, from motives of convenience: a censure in
which we cannot join. Principles of government are not laws of eternal
nature, but maxims of human prudence, fluctuating as the mind of man and
the exigencies of society. A truth, in politics, Edition: current; Page:
[342] which is no longer suited to the state of civilization and the
tendencies of the human mind, has ceased to be a truth. The will of the
majority is not to be obeyed as a law, but it is to be attended to as a
fact: the opinions and feelings of the nation are entitled to
consideration, not for their own sake, but as one of the circumstances
of the times; one of the elements of that existing state of society,
upon which your laws have to operate; an important part of the situation
of the country: a cause, which produces effects not to be overlooked; a
power, which so largely modifies and interferes with all you do, that
unless it is allowed for in your calculations, you can predict nothing.

M. Périer is at liberty to think that it is the faults, and not the
virtues, of his countrymen, which render a hereditary peerage unfit for
them: it is enough that he perceives that institution to be radically
incompatible with the feelings and habits of the French people. Solon
has not been accused of tergiversation, for saying that he had given to
the Athenians, not the best possible laws, but the best which they were
capable of receiving;2 and M. Périer, apparently, considers himself to
be following in the footsteps of the Athenian lawgiver.

Though we cannot join with the French Minister in lamenting that state
of public opinion which renders a hereditary peerage no longer possible
in France; its expediency, like that of most other political
institutions, is, with us as with him, a question of time, place, and
circumstance. This is not the place for determining, with precision, the
conditions which are required to render that institution eligible. The
consideration would lead us far beyond the present subject, and we are
not writing a treatise on the art of government. But, that the most
indispensable of those conditions is wanting in France, the most
superficial knowledge of that country is sufficient to evince.

All arguments in favour of an Upper Chamber assume that the Lower one is
liable to be too much under the immediate influence of public opinion;
that it is too accessible to sudden gusts of popular feeling; and if not
held in check by another body, would vacillate between opposite
extremes, and innovate too frequently and too suddenly. Suppose,
therefore, a people liable to these sudden gusts, and a Lower House so
constituted as not to be likely to resist them: where shall the Upper
House find strength to withstand the united impulse of the people and
the Chamber of Deputies?—Not in the sword: for the sword, without some
one to wield it, is but cold iron. Mankind, in these days, are not ruled
by the sword, but by opinion; and a power which will dare resist the
people, must be conscious of a moral ascendancy over them. But birth and
wealth confer no moral ascendancy in France; and the French Peerage,
moreover, possess, for the most part, neither the one nor the other.

Edition: current; Page: [343]
Persons who have never lived out of England imagine that the respect of
mankind attaches itself to riches and genealogy by an inherent virtue;
and the conception of those extrinsic advantages existing apart from
unbounded deference and homage, is more than they are able to figure to
themselves. Frenchmen, on the other hand, are no less astonished at
finding that in this country the Duke of Northumberland3 is a greater
man than Sir Humphrey Davy, and Mr. Baring than Sir Walter Scott. This
is one of those broad and all-pervading differences between nations,
which render it absurd to transfer institutions ready-made from one
country to another. The only moral ascendancy in France is that of
personal qualities; and personal qualities are not hereditary.

There is no great difference of opinion in France respecting the ends to
be aimed at in the composition of a Second Chamber. The Courrier
Français, one of the ablest and most stedfast of the popular journals,
in a sober and well-reasoned article on the peerage question, lays down
these principles: That the well-being of society depends upon the due
intermixture of the conservative and the progressive spirit; that the
progressive tendency is naturally predominant in an assembly purely
popular in its constitution: and it is consequently desirable, that, in
the other branch of the legislature, the balance should incline to the
conservative side.4 A doctrine precisely similar was laid down by M.
Casimir Périer, in his speech introducing the ministerial project. He
said, that to each of the two Chambers was confided, in a more peculiar
degree, the guardianship of one of the two principles, on the apt
combination of which good government depends: to the Peers, the element
of stability—to the Deputies, the element of improvement. The parties
being thus sufficiently agreed on the question of principle, all that
remains open to debate is a question of fact; namely, what are the
materials in France for forming an assembly, which, with a decided
overbalance of the conservative spirit, shall unite the greatest
attainable amount of wisdom and virtue? With this view the popular party
are ready to admit of rather a high qualification in age, and even in
property, because the tendencies of age, and of riches, are generally
adverse to change. And they contend that the Second Chamber should be
exclusively composed of “les illustrations nationales;”5 of men of
established reputation in all the greater concerns of mankind, in
politics, judicature, literature, science, and war. Such persons, having
little to gain in reputation and much to lose, have an interest against
rash experiments, similar to that which men of large fortune have; while
they possess also (what men of large fortune have not) tried abilities,
to prevent their tardiness from degenerating into a stupid dread of
innovation; and a natural influence on the public mind, which gives
weight to their opinions, and ensures, as far as any Edition: current;
Page: [344] thing can ensure, a willing acquiescence in their decrees.
New men, on the contrary, who have their reputation to acquire, and who,
having less of the self-distrust which is the fruit of experience, are
supposed to be more easily fired by vast schemes of improvement, and
less alive to difficulties and dangers, would find their fit place in
the Chamber of Deputies, where this faulty excess of valuable qualities
could do no harm, as all their acts would be subject to the revision of
the more cautious body.

It is a great mistake, therefore, to suppose that the contest against
the inheritableness of the Peerage arises from a levelling spirit, or a
reckless impatience of any obstacle to the omnipotence of the popular
will. It is an affair of philosophy and reflection, not of blind
passion; although doubtless, in France, the hatred of unearned
distinctions is a passion, and an almost universal one. Glad should we
be, nevertheless, if we thought, that in our own country, such a
question would be argued on either side with so impartial a judgment, or
upon principles so unambiguous, definite, and comprehensive.

The project of M. Casimir Périer includes no change in the constitution
of the Second Chamber, beyond the suppression of the hereditary
principle. The Peers are to hold their seats for life, to be unlimited
in their numbers, and to be named solely by the King. To the first of
these three propositions, the popular party do not object; but the other
two will be strongly opposed, and an attempt made for a partial
introduction of the principle of popular election, either by requiring
the King to select from candidates presented by the electors or by the
Chamber of Deputies, or by giving the absolute nomination of a certain
proportion to the King, and a certain proportion to the people.

On this occasion, as on almost every other, it will be found on trial
how much easier it is to destroy than to rebuild; how much more obvious
it commonly is, what is bad, than what is good. Yet we incline to the
opinion that M. Périer’s plan has the advantage over every other which
has been proposed. We are convinced that no functionary who holds his
place for life, ought to be chosen by popular election. A numerous body
(and the people are the most numerous of all bodies), is essentially
unfit to perform any act that is to be irrevocable. Nothing but a keen
sense of undivided responsibility is a guarantee for the degree of
forethought and deliberation which such an act demands. What renders
popular election endurable, and even causes it to work well upon the
whole (more than this cannot yet be said of any government, in so
imperfect a state of the human mind), is the frequent opportunities
which the people have of correcting a first error. If they were held by
an indissoluble tie to their first choice, how bitterly they would often
repent of it. The public are scarcely judges of a man’s qualifications
until he has been tried; and impostors, who knew that what was once
gained could no more be lost, would exhaust all the resources of
deception. On the other hand, if the election is for short periods, the
Second Chamber is but another First Chamber, and may very well be
spared.

Men who are nominated for life are, of course, irresponsible when once
Edition: current; Page: [345] appointed; the utmost you can do is to
secure a considerate choice: and this you are more likely to obtain from
an officer responsible to the people, than from the people themselves.
The King, it is true, is not responsible, but his Ministers are; that is
to say (the only true meaning of ministerial responsibility), they incur
more or less danger of losing their places by a misuse of this power, or
of any other. If the constitution of the Lower House is not sufficient
to prevent the systematic misapplication of the royal power, it is good
for very little. The privilege of creating Peers is not more liable to
abuse, under an adequately representative government, than that of
appointing judges or general officers. The true wisdom of the people is,
to take every possible security that whatever power is given to their
supreme government shall not be abused to selfish ends, and then to let
the measure of that power be large and liberal.

But the popular party in France are at present in a position which
renders complete impartiality impossible. They are biassed by a
well-grounded distrust of the present Ministry and King; who, during the
transitional state of the national institutions, and the wavering and
unsettled disposition of the representative Chamber, are sure to throw
the whole weight of all the powers which may be entrusted to them, into
the scale opposite to improvement. And it is feared, not altogether
without reason, that the hereditary principle, though eliminated from
the laws, may practically survive its nominal abrogation, in the hands
of a King and Ministry avowed adherents of it, and empowered to confer
the peerage, if it so please them, upon the lineal heir of every
deceased Peer. If so, the new system will have all the disadvantages of
the old one, together with the additional one of rendering the peerage
still more dependant upon the Crown.

This danger, however, will probably be obviated by an amendment, which
the Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, though composed almost
entirely of adherents of the Minister, is expected to introduce, and by
which the King, in his nominations to the peerage, will be restricted to
persons of certain classes, or of a certain definite description. The
limitations, no doubt, will leave ample scope for improper choice. But
the promotions of the Dupin’s, and Jars’s, and Rambuteau’s,6 from one
Chamber to the other, will at least have this advantage, that their
places in the more influential body will be better filled; for the same
electors who will not cashier an old representative, will often elect a
fitter one in his place when he retires. And France will at least have
gained the extinction of the hereditary principle; a good in itself, and
an important step in the progress of constitutional improvement.

This paragraph is headed “London, September 4.” The entry in Mill’s

including No. 178), reads: “The summary of French news in the Examiner
from 4th September 1831 to 15th July 1832 inclusive, missing only one
Sunday (July 1st) and comprising many long articles” (MacMinn, p. 17).

holds out expectations of a considerable relaxation of the restrictions
on the importation of foreign commodities.1 We hail this with joy, as

French Government.

the commission, or Select Committee, appointed by the French Chamber of
Deputies to examine and report upon the proposed law relative to the
Peerage,1 is expected almost immediately to present its report. A day
will then be immediately appointed for the commencement of the debate.

In the mean while the Chamber has afforded an agreeable earnest of its
disposition to retrenchment, by making a reduction of one half in the
emoluments of its own President, and its two executive officers termed
Quaestors. One of the Paris correspondents of The Times considers this
measure to be of most evil augury, and writes with great apprehension of
the spirit of economy which is abroad.2 We hope that this specimen of
the juste-milieu party so warmly espoused by The Times, will not be lost
upon the readers of that journal.

The advantages of a cheap government are visible by the light of mere
good intentions. We fear that less is to be expected from the Chamber
wherever Edition: current; Page: [347] reading, meditation, and
political experience, are among the requisites of practical wisdom. The
new members who compose nearly half the Chamber, consist chiefly of
obscure men, who have never stirred, either bodily or mentally, out of
their little country village. This is to be ascribed to a variety of
causes. One cause is the needless and mischievous provision of the
Charter, by which every department is required to select at least half
its deputies from the inhabitants of the department.3 Another is the
narrow limits within which the choice of the constituency is still
restrained, by the pecuniary conditions of eligibility. A third is the
breaking up of the constituent body into small fractions, by the narrow
extent of the electoral districts; many of which do not muster more than
from two to three hundred electors, who do not include any inhabitants
of considerable towns, nor even are under the habitual influence of
such, by personal intercourse either in politics or daily life. Neither
must we omit to observe, that most of the politicians who figured in
public affairs before the revolution of 1830 were disqualified by their
servile habits, and retrograde or stationary spirit, from being the
representatives of electors who repudiate those habits and that spirit,
and whose choice, consequently, was unavoidably made, in a great
measure, from the young or the untried.

Three elections have lately taken place for Paris, Lunéville, and
Boulogne; all have terminated in favour of the ministerial candidates.
The last of the three is a victory, for the retiring member belonged to
the Opposition. In the other two cases the predecessors of the new
members were of the same politics as themselves.

The remarks of our Paris correspondent on the character and disposition
of the Chamber will be read with interest.4


118.: THE SUGAR REFINERY BILL AND THE SLAVE TRADE
 EXAMINER, 18 SEPT., 1831, PP. 594-5

This article is in response to the temporary alliance between the West
India planters and traders and the “Saints” (the Evangelical Clapham
Sect) and their fellow opponents of slavery, in opposition to “A Bill to
Continue and Amend the Provisions of the Acts for Allowing Sugar to Be
Delivered out of Warehouse to Be Refined,” 1 & 2 William IV (29 Sept.,
1831), PP, 1831, III, 437-40 (not enacted), which was designed to amend
and continue 11 George IV & 1 William IV, c. 72 (23 July, 1830). Mill’s
leading article, in the “Political Examiner,” is headed as title.
Described in his bibliography as “An article headed ‘The Sugar Refinery
Bill and the Slave Trade’ in the Examiner of 18th September 1831”
(MacMinn, p. 18), it is listed as title and enclosed in square brackets
in the Somerville College set.

Edition: current; Page: [348]
the saints and the west indians, those inveterate enemies, whose
quarrels, next to those of the Orangemen and Catholics, engross the
unceasing attention of the Ministry and Parliament; those rival powers
between whom the administration of the day is perpetually engaged in
negociating a compromise, not on the principle of giving to each his
due, but on the simpler and easier one of giving to each half his
demand—the Saints and the West Indians, strange to say, are now, for the
first time, enlisted under the same banner,—fighting in a common cause
against the Ministry. The subject of this contest is the proposed
renewal of the temporary act, which permits foreign sugar to be refined
in this country. The West Indians oppose this, because the sugar does
not come from their plantations; the Saints, because it comes, in great
part, from countries which have not effectually abolished the African
Slave Trade.

While the Reform Bill is pending,1 the reasons are obvious for keeping
all other questions precisely as they are; for attempting no change,
which can be deferred until it can be subjected to the deliberation of a
better legislature,—commencing no discussion to which the attention of
the public, those persons excepted who have a personal interest in the
question, would be very slackly and lazily directed. Since, therefore,
the proposed Bill does not change the existing law, but keeps it as it
is for a year longer, when it would otherwise revert from what it is to
what it formerly was;2 the course of every wise and disinterested Member
of Parliament should be to vote with the Minister,3 leaving the ultimate
disposal of the question to a reformed Parliament.

It is not, however, to be disguised that the objections to the measure,
considered as an indirect encouragement of the Slave Trade, are of very
considerable weight. And no subject calls more loudly for consideration,
so soon as there shall be leisure for it, than the large annual
sacrifices which the English nation has long made, and still continues
to make, for the suppression of the trade in negroes, while it has yet
failed to discover the means of rendering those sacrifices really
available for the truly virtuous purpose for which it readily and
eagerly incurs them. What follows? Not any motive for abandoning the
attempt; but merely a new illustration of the maxim of universal
experience, that half-measures are in the end almost always more
troublesome and costly than effectual ones.

The treaties for the abolition of the Slave Trade were a phenomenon
previously unknown; an indication of an immense step in the progress of
Edition: current; Page: [349] mankind; the first solemn recognition by
the European powers that nations have duties, other than the merely
negative one of not molesting one another; the first international
compact which had both for its avowed and for its true object, not the
security or aggrandizement, real or imaginary, of the contracting
parties themselves—but the performance of a disinterested service to a
third party, which that party had no claim to, except the claims of
humanity.4 This great step having been achieved, and the possibility
having been demonstrated that nations, as well as individuals, may be
induced to bind themselves to perform an act of virtue, at the sacrifice
of their immediate selfish interests; what is to hinder them from
combining in a similar manner to overcome another and a much less
appalling difficulty—that of compelling a few unprincipled individuals,
or a few unprincipled governments, to abide by the general compact?

For many years it was affirmed, that the French Government was the
principal obstacle to the complete annihilation of the slave trade. The
French Government would now be no obstacle. It is eager to render its
measures of prevention as effectual as possible. In the last session, a
bill passed the Chambers, and became law, for this express purpose.5 The
interests opposed to the cause of slave-trade abolition, in France, are
comparatively feeble; and the public feeling would support the
Government (of whose good inclination on this subject there is no doubt)
in any reasonable measure which could be proposed to it by our Ministry,
for giving effect to the wishes of every honest man in the two
countries.

The real obstacles to the extirpation of the Slave Trade are Portugal
and Brazil; and shall England and France, either of whom could conquer
both countries in a single campaign, allow their noblest purposes to be
baffled by these contemptible little powers, when for half the annual
expense of Sierra Leone, they might take means for searching every
vessel which enters the ports of either country?

In the mean time, England is spending immense sums, and the lives of
thousands of her people, upon a pestilential swamp on the coast of
Africa; and, finding that this does no good, she is meditating another
experiment of the same kind in another spot, little better than the
first; she has her Sierra Leone, and her Fernando Po (compare either of
them with the American black colony of Liberia!).6 But this is not all:
she is inflicting a real injustice upon her own colonists, by
restrictive regulations, which do not at all conduce to the Edition:
current; Page: [350] suppression of the African Slave Trade, but which
greatly aggravate the inevitable ruin of our ancient Slave Colonies. We
allude more particularly to the prohibition of the trade in slaves
between colony and colony.

It is well known, that the numerous and extensive colonial possessions,
which we acquired in the last war,7 have by their inexhaustible
productiveness, and the immense increase of their cultivation, so
greatly undersold our old Slave Islands (which were never equally
fertile, and are now in a great degree exhausted) that the proprietors
of the latter are utterly and irrecoverably impoverished.8 As their
estates have sunk in value, and their produce has fallen off, there is
of course no internal market for their slaves. On the other hand, in the
thriving colonies whose competition has ruined them, the increase of the
demand for labour is constantly raising the price of slaves; and the
difficulty of increasing the number is an increasing temptation to
overwork them more and more. We are informed, that in Tobago the price
of an able-bodied slave is not more than thirty pounds sterling, while
in the neighbouring island of Trinidad, a new and fertile colony, it is
not less than eighty. The ruin of the former colony would be partly
alleviated, if its proprietors were permitted to dispose of their slaves
to those who are suffering for want of them. The old colonies would then
be almost entirely abandoned; and the British legislature would no
longer be deafened with the din of never-ceasing demands, that the
people of England may be taxed to relieve the distress of those, whose
distress admits of no permanent relief, unless they are to be maintained
as pensioners of the English nation.

We can conceive no motive for the prohibition of the internal Slave
Trade, except the fear, that under colour of importing slaves from our
own colonies, they would be imported from Africa. But this there could
be no difficulty in guarding against, as the slaves are all registered.
Governments, when they really wish it, succeed every day in taking
efficacious precautions for the observance of regulations far more
difficult to enforce.

It seems to be generally thought that the fate of Poland has added so
much to the unpopularity of the Ministers, as must speedily compel them
to resign. They have sustained a signal defeat in the Chamber of
Deputies, by the adoption of a proposition for restoring the military
rank of the officers appointed during the hundred days, by Napoleon, and
by the provisional government which succeeded him.3 A debate, which was
originated by MM. Mauguin and Laurence,4 and which has already lasted
several days,5 on the state of the nation (as we should say in England),
is likely, in the opinion of many, to give the final blow to the Périer
Administration.

Meanwhile, this Administration has given another manifestation of its
hostility to popular institutions, and to the spirit of the nation.

Those who are acquainted with the institutions of France, are aware that
very extensive functions of local taxation and administration are
confided to deliberative bodies, varying in number from nine or ten to
about thirty members, and called departmental councils, councils of
arrondissement, and municipal councils. The authority of a departmental
council extends over the whole of one of the eighty-six departments of
France—that of a council of arrondissement comprises one of the four or
five sections into which each department is divided—and a municipal
council manages the affairs of a single commune; that is, a township or
village.

Under the government of Napoleon, faithfully copied by the restored
Bourbons, every member of every one of these bodies was named by the
Crown, or by its agent, the préfet or maire.6 France, therefore,
presented, under these rulers, the unique spectacle (unique at least in
Europe, and certainly unknown to the feudal and despotic monarchy which
preceded the French revolution) of a country which did not contain a
vestige of any local authority, even down to a village watchman, that
did not emanate from the Crown.

A law which passed subsequently to the revolution of July 1830, restored
to the people, or rather to a small portion of the people, the choice of
the municipal councils. The responsibility, however, of these bodies was
reduced almost to nothing, by one absurd provision: they are elected for
six years.7

The councils of the departments and of the arrondissements, are still
named by the Crown. Universal opinion, however, has long required that
this should cease. That the “intervention of the citizens” should be
allowed in the choice of the local authorities, was one of the pledges
given by the Chamber, on the revision Edition: current; Page: [353] of
the charter after the revolution, and sworn to by Louis Philippe on his
accession to the throne.8 To redeem this pledge, a bill has now been
introduced by the Ministry.9 But we are much mistaken if it fulfils the
hopes of the nation; and we are sure that it ought not to satisfy their
wishes.

Not only does this bill extend to the other local bodies, the clause
which renders popular election almost nugatory in the municipal
councils, that which enacts that they be elected for six years—not only
this, but it assumes a basis for the representation of the people in the
local councils, scarcely wider than that which has been adopted for the
Chamber of Deputies. All who have votes for the Chamber, are to have
votes for the local councils, together with all who are inscribed on the
jury list; but these last consist only of the former, and of certain
liberal professions, not numerous anywhere, except in the large towns.
Should the number of persons thus qualified in each arrondissement not
amount to one two-hundredth part of the population, that proportion is
to be made up by the addition of the most highly taxed; and in no case
is the number to be less than fifty in each arrondissement. This last
provision shows how clearly it is foreseen that in some, and probably in
many arrondissements, the electoral body will be little better than a
select vestry, meeting to choose a sub-committee of its own body.

The electors of the Chamber of Deputies are very far from sufficiently
numerous, being only about 200,000 in a population of 32,000,000. But
even were the fact otherwise, the qualification for local councils ought
to be far lower than that which is usually thought desirable for the
council of the nation. First, because less is risked, the interests at
stake being less important, and the legislature being always there to
interpose in case of serious mismanagement. Next, because the people at
large, by superintending the management of their own local affairs,
would be prepared and educated for the ultimate exercise of a more
extensive share in the superintendence of the general government. And,
lastly, because the local councils, not having, like the legislature,
the eyes of a whole nation fixed upon them, stand in still greater need
of the check of actual accountability to those whose interests are
confided to them, and over whom they exercise their power.

In addition to this law respecting the composition of the departmental
and arrondissemental councils, another law is proposed to define their
functions and authorities;10 and a third to define, in like manner, the
functions and authorities Edition: current; Page: [354] of the municipal
councils,11 this object not having been provided for by the law passed
in the previous session. These two bills ought to be attentively studied
by our own statesmen; who will certainly be called upon, as one of the
earliest duties of a Reformed Parliament, to create similar local
councils for Great Britain, and to determine what portion of the public
business shall devolve upon such bodies.

The commission, or select committee, appointed by the Chamber to examine
the proposition of the Government respecting the peerage, have at last
presented their report.12 The only material alterations which they
propose in the ministerial plan, is the limitation of the royal choice
to certain classes of persons, consisting chiefly of deputies, judges,
law officers, and placemen of various descriptions, after a certain
number of years service; members of the four academies of the Institute;
military and naval officers of the rank of a lieutenant-general or a
vice-admiral; and persons who pay 5,000 francs a year (about 200l.) of
direct taxes. On the whole, the catalogue seems a very weak and
ineffective attempt towards an enumeration of the sorts of persons who
may be presumed fit to form part of a conservative branch of the
legislature.

A law proposed some time ago by the ministry, for amending the existing
laws on the recruiting of the army, has just been returned from the
commission to which it was referred.13 The admirable practice of
referring all bills and all propositions whatever to a select committee,
whose duty it is thoroughly to examine the whole subject both in its
principles and details, deserves to be introduced into every legislative
assembly. The reports of these committees are frequently models of
statesmanship, and practical political science. The excellent report
just submitted on the loi du recrutement might be cited as an example.
That steady and comprehensive perception of general principles, combined
with a just appreciation of individual circumstances, which is
characteristic of the better class of French public men, is nowhere more
conspicuous than in these documents.

A most absurd petition has been presented to the Chamber of Deputies,
for an application to the British Government to obtain the remains of
Napoleon, in order that they may be buried under the column in the Place
Vendôme.14 This gave rise to a debate, remarkable for the effusions of
Bonapartism which several Edition: current; Page: [355] of the speakers
thought it a favourable opportunity for giving vent to:—effusions which,
however extravagant, may be excused in a Las Cases and a Bertrand, but
which inspire unmingled disgust when emanating from Lamarque,
Briqueville, Larabit, and others of the military faction.15 To hear
these men, it might be supposed that Buonaparte had been not only the
most virtuous and enlightened ruler, but the greatest man of modern
times; the warmest well-wisher of free institutions; the most ardent
promoter of civilisation; and that France would remember him, not as one
of the most selfish, ungenerous, and narrow-minded adventurers who ever
usurped supreme power, but as the greatest benefactor of his country
during his life, and the man who sheds most glory upon her now when he
is dead. In vain did M. Comte, the high-minded author of the Censeur
Européen, lift up his voice against this senseless and degrading
idolatry.16 The Chamber almost unanimously gave their countenance to the
prayer of the petition, by referring it to the Council of Ministers.

M. Comte likewise laid on the table of the Chamber a proposition to
abolish the vote by ballot in their own deliberations—in which its
effect is obviously one of pure mischief; to shield the representatives
from responsibility to their constituents.17 This proposition, however,
obtaining the assent of no more than two out of the nine bureaux into
which the Chamber is divided, was rejected without a public discussion.
M. Comte should next propose the abolition of that most improper
regulation of the Chamber, which prescribes that all propositions shall
be discussed in the bureaux and in secret, before they can be debated in
public; and that unless a motion passes three of the nine bureaux, it
shall not be discussed, or so much as publicly declared, in the
assembled legislature.18

121.: DR. WHATELY’S ELEVATION TO AN ARCHBISHOPRIC

Archbishopric” (MacMinn, p. 19), is listed (“Paragraph on Dr Whately’s

about to be, appointed to the vacant Archbishopric of Dublin. A minister
desirous of saving the Church, by the only means by which it has now any
chance of being saved—by improving its spirit—could not make a more
advisable appointment. Dr. Whately is known to the public chiefly by his
writings; and among these, less by the many which are of a religious
character, than by such works as his Elements of Logic, his Elements of
Rhetoric, and his Introductory Lectures on Political Economy.2 The
merits of these are well known. Scarcely any writer of the present day
has combined so great talents for popular exposition, with so much power
of thought, so judiciously directed, on subjects of great importance in
themselves, and not sufficiently cultivated even by the most educated
class. His influence cannot but be most salutary in promoting among his
clergy that general mental culture, now so rare in a profession which
has heretofore produced so many great men. Dr. Whately’s works also
display, along with abundant zeal for the established Church, an
enlarged and liberal interpretation of religion, remote from the narrow
and exclusive spirit of a sect, and more allied to the late lamented
Bishop Heber3 than to the modern ascetics, who have inherited the worst
qualities both of the Churchmen and the Puritans of former times,
without the redeeming virtues of either.

the debate in the french chamber on the policy of the Ministers, was
terminated by a decision in their favour. On their foreign policy, the
Chamber pronounced, by a large majority, that it was satisfied with
their explanations: on their internal policy, the previous question was
moved, and carried without a division.1

The Chamber may thus be considered to have pledged itself to a pacific
policy in future, and taken its share of the responsibility of all the
measures, by which the Ministry has hitherto endeavoured to preserve
peace. But, on the internal policy of the Ministers, the Chamber is in
no way pledged. It has merely declared itself unprepared to pass a
sweeping condemnation on the whole Ministerial system. Its own conduct
has shown, up to the present time, that neither is it prepared, nor even
inclined, sweepingly to approve. And, although the Chamber has shown no
fixed system, or definite views of its own, it has manifested several
times, by its votes, that it is disposed to go much further than the
present Ministers, both in administrative, and even in constitutional
improvements.

Edition: current; Page: [358]
the abolition of the Hereditary Peerage has passed the French Chamber of
Deputies by a majority of 324 against 86.1 That it would pass, we never
had the shadow of a doubt; but the greatness of the majority is wholly
ascribed to the impression produced by the rejection of our Reform
Bill,2—especially as the advocates of the hereditary principle had been
sufficiently ignorant of the social condition of England to imagine that
our Peerage was a very strong example in their favour, and a conclusive
proof of the compatibility of such an institution with the highest
degree of prosperity and good government. It is seldom that a false
theory in politics meets with so decisive a refutation, from the course
of events, in the very nick of time; on the very day when the
representatives of a great nation are called upon to pronounce, by their
votes, upon the truth or falsehood of the doctrine.

As the voting was by ballot, there cannot be the slightest colour for
imputing the result to personal fear of falling under public
disapprobation.

The Chamber has still to decide what system of election or nomination it
is disposed to substitute for the hereditary succession. Among the
multitude of systems proposed, there is likely to be much difficulty in
obtaining for any one the concurrence of a majority of suffrages.

The Ministerial plan leaves the nomination entirely to the King. This
plan does not seem likely to obtain the assent of the majority, who have
not sufficient confidence in the King to expect from him a good choice.
Almost every deputy of note has, therefore, his pet scheme for
restricting the royal choice by some partial introduction of the
principle of popular election.

All these schemes appear to us to be bad. If a certain proportion were
named by the King, and a certain proportion by the people, the two
halves might be expected to act as the mere attornies of the power to
which they owed their seats. They would fancy themselves placed there,
not to legislate for the general good, but to defend kingly power, or
popular rights. If, again, the people elect candidates, and the King
makes his choice among them, it would be far better to give the choice
to the people at once,—for to them it would, in reality, belong. If the
King had the sole choice, but were compelled to choose from certain
classes, or categories (to use the French expression), the objection
would be that the widest categories cannot include all the fit persons,
while the narrowest would leave ample scope for appointing unfit ones.

Edition: current; Page: [359]
The best checks or restrictions which occur to us for preventing the
abuse of the royal power of creating Peers, would be these:—That the
ordonnance by which a Peer is created, should be countersigned by all
the Ministers, and preceded by a particular statement of the merits or
services which had entitled him to the Peerage; or that the Chamber of
Deputies should have, not the right of electing Peers, or even
candidates for the Peerage, but a negative on their appointment. Peers
would then be created on the nomination of the King, with the
concurrence and sanction of the Chamber of Deputies.

the discussion on the French Peerage is nearly closed. The Chamber has
rejected all the schemes for making the Peerage elective, or for
obliging the King to select from candidates presented by the people.1
The system adopted has been that of restricting the royal choice to
certain categories, or classes of persons. On one point of some
importance, the Ministry has been defeated. The Commission had proposed,
that landed proprietors, or heads of commercial or banking
establishments, paying 5000 francs of direct taxes, should be eligible
to the Peerage; but the Chamber has added, as a necessary condition,
that they should have been for six years members of one of the
Departmental or Municipal Councils, elected by the people.

The French Government has taken a great step towards free trade. It has
introduced a new corn law, abolishing prohibitions, and permitting
importation and exportation at a reduced scale of duties.2

Edition: current; Page: [360]
the french ministry has proposed a bill for the establishment in every
commune (parish or township) in France, of an elementary school, where
instruction will be given, for a small fee, to those who can afford to
pay it; and gratuitously to those who cannot.1 Education will thus be
brought home to every man’s door. Nor will this education be confined to
reading and writing; it will include (we quote from our contemporary,
the Globe), “moral and religious instruction, according to the views of
the parents; reading, writing, the French language, arithmetic, the
legal system of weights and measures; and, according to the extent of
local resources, drawing, surveying, and elementary notions of geography
and history.”2

In none of the more civilized countries of the world was this great
national measure more urgently required. It is computed by those
Frenchmen who have most studied the statistics of their own country,
that of the adult population of France not more than one-third can read.
And we have been assured, that electors, and even members of the great
or departmental colleges which existed before the late Revolution—men,
therefore, who formed part of the twenty or thirty thousand richest
persons in France—were obliged, in giving their votes, to have the name
of the candidate for whom they voted written for them by others, being
themselves unable to write.

On the details of the proposed Education Bill we shall give our opinion
when it comes on for discussion. At present, we give from the English
papers part of M. de Montalivet’s speech, to which we shall subjoin some
excellent observations of the Globe.

M. de Montalivet passed in review the history of gratuitous elementary
education in France, from the first dawn of the system, as originated at
Rheims, in 1680, by the philanthropic Delasalle,3 to the present moment.
Until after the breaking out of the French revolution, it can barely be
said to have existed, but in 1791 the principle was adopted into the
Constitution,4 and various laws regulating the mode and scale of
retribution of the education of the lower classes, were passed in 1793
and 1794.5 Under the empire but little attention was paid to it, the
nation being exclusively occupied by the ideas of military glory, but in
1816 the Lancasterian method was imported into France,6 and so fostered
by Edition: current; Page: [361] various ordonnances and regulations of
the government,7 that between 1816 and 1822 the number of pupils in the
schools was nearly tripled. The impulse thus given to the system was
sufficient to enable it to resist the effect of the Ordonnance prompted
by the evil genius of the Restoration, which placed all the schools
under the exclusive controul of the Bishops,8 and it is the proud office
of the Revolution of 1830 to remove all the shackles which impede its
progress, and render it fully available for the universal enlightenment
of the mass of the population.9 The two great questions which present
themselves in regulating the systems he stated to be—1st. Whether the
reception of primary education should be voluntary or compulsory; and
2nd. Whether it should be open to free competition. On the first point
he remarked, that in Germany all parents are compelled, under severe
penalties, to send their children to the communal school,10 on the
principle, that as, on the one hand, the government, in its paternal
character, was bound to provide all its subjects with the means of
education, it had on the other, a right to claim from them the filial
duty of availing themselves of it in such a manner as to become useful
members of the social body. He, however, stated that, powerful as this
argument was, the system of compulsion was too much opposed to the
character of the French nation, to admit of his recommending its
adoption. He had, therefore, preferred leaving the system to make its
way by the force of its intrinsic advantages, and that it would do so,
was evident from the fact that since July 1830, three hundred new
schools had been opened, and 600,000 volumes distributed. The second
point was, he said, virtually decided by the promise of the Charter that
education should be free; the most ample scope for competition would
therefore be allowed (hear, hear), and every one who possessed the
necessary moral and intellectual qualifications would be at liberty to
open a school. (Hear, hear.) But in order not to leave education wholly
to the fluctuating chances of private speculation, primary schools would
be divided into two classes, communal and private, both of which would
be subjected to the controul of a committee, in which the Government,
the country, and the families of the children, would be alike
efficiently represented; while misconduct in the masters of the private
schools would be immediately punished by the civil tribunal of the
arrondissement, which would be authorized to take cognisance of any
complaint made by the committee, and for the rectitude of whose
decisions there would be the additional guarantee of a power of appeal
to the Cour Royale. The communal schools would afford gratuitous
instruction to indigent families. Each master would be chosen by the
commune through the mayor, and would have, in addition to his lodging,
and whatever monthly sums he might receive from those able to pay for
their instruction, a fixed salary, the amount to be fixed every five
years by the municipal authority, the minimum of which would be 200
francs, and which would be raised by an addition to the principal of the
direct taxes not exceeding five centimes. Provision would be made that
such communes as were too poor to pay this salary should be assisted by
the department, and that the State should come to the assistance of the
department, in case that should not be able to discharge it. Retiring
pensions for the masters would be provided from a fund formed by the
annual payment by all the masters of one-twentieth part of their salary.
The masters of the communal schools would, in case of misconduct, be
amenable to, and liable to be suspended by, the committee of primary
instruction, from whose decision an appeal would be to the academic
council. In order to bring this system into action as fully and Edition:
current; Page: [362] speedily as possible, each department would be
authorized to establish one Ecole Primaire Normale for the education of
young men intended to become masters of primary schools. The hon. member
then read the bill, which was ordered to be printed.11

Briefly as we have been enabled, [says the Globe], to give the outline,
it is of a nature to call for much attention in a country which piques
itself on a passion for the diffusion of knowledge, and which possesses
ample funds, too, for the purpose, were they administered wisely and
honestly in the furtherance of instruction, congenial with the progress
and the spirit of the age, instead of being frittered away by corporate
bodies, and nominal trusts, too many of which are anything but
trustworthy, and the interest of a great number of whom is directly
opposed to the extension of the intended benefit. Allowing for the
various difficulties and discrepancies which must necessarily be
encountered, in maturing so extensive a scheme, is it possible to
conceive the establishment of such a system of national education in
France, for any time, without a necessity on the part of Great Britain
of following the example? In spite of the satire, the squib, and the
sneer of the multifarious cultivators of the department of Littlewit,12
the education of the many is a virtual emancipation from the monopoly
and oppression of the few; and hence so much ultra, clerical, and
patrician objection, cavil, discountenance, and ridicule. We will not
say (for we are not for pressing down a corporation, which is so
actively doing that business for itself) who they are who have never
voluntarily stepped forward in the honourable path of promoting the
instruction of their needy fellow-creatures, however forced in the
sequel, by the activity of other people, to crawl after in the rear. Who
cannot recollect the affected alarm, and sinister opposition, which the
foremost man of the day had to encounter a few years ago, when he
attempted to concoct the preliminaries of a plan that would render
education general?13 We still hope to witness his master-mind engaged
upon some scheme of kindred utility, with the countenance and support of
the government, of which he forms a part. Were, indeed, Providence, in
its anger to produce a Tory return to power, with this example of France
before the national eye, something in the same line must be attempted,
at least if the salutary operation of the two countries upon each other
remain a substitute for the blind antipathy engendered by ignorance, and
fostered by design.14

The forthcoming number of The Foreign Quarterly Review gives some very
interesting information, with relation to the exertions made by private
individuals in France, for the diffusion of knowledge, by the
publication of elementary books of instruction, in the composition of
which the French excel, as they do not (like most authors of elementary
works in England) write upon the unfortunate presumption, that the
reader is already, in some degree, acquainted with the subject.15

We have great satisfaction in perceiving numerous indications that the
organs of the public mind in France are approximating to a juster
appreciation of the impolicy of the restrictive and prohibitory
commercial system. M. Mauguin, a few days ago, made profession of
opinions favourable to free trade, and the Ministry at once professed
concurrence in them, promising the speedy introduction of a bill,
modifying the whole of the present custom regulations and duties.16

the only circumstance of any considerable interest afforded by the
French papers of the week, is the trial of the author and publishers of
an article in the newspaper La Tribune, imputing to MM. Soult and
Casimir Périer, the receipt of a corrupt consideration for a contract,
concluded by them in England some months ago for the purchase of
muskets.1 Enough was established to account for the general belief of
this rumour, though not to prove it well-founded. The French Ministers,
or their confidential agents, appear clearly to have paid a high price
for bad fire-arms, when good ones were offered at a lower price. But
they plead, in justification, that the necessity of immediately
supplying the National Guard with arms, obliged them to close with the
persons who could furnish them with the greatest number in the shortest

the french minister has at length carried the Peerage Bill into the
Chamber of Peers1—but not till after creating a batch of thirty-six
peers, in order to secure its passing.

The list of newly-created Legislators, with one or two honourable
exceptions, is utterly despicable. It puts an end at once to all those
hopes, which alone induced the French nation to tolerate a second
chamber not elected by the people. The Peerage ought to have been
re-constituted, and if it was absurdly determined that the present
members should retain their seats for life, it was at least understood
that the chamber was to be recruited from the élite of France in
politics, literature, science, industry, and art. Instead of this, the
list is made up of fifth-rate diplomatists and prefects under the
Imperial Government, and tenth-rate Bonapartist officers; all the
eminent commanders whom France possesses being either peers already, or
in the ranks of the opposition.

Science is represented in this batch of peers only by the weathercock
Cuvier, Edition: current; Page: [365] who, with all his political
demerits (and a more servile sycophant of every established government
never existed),2 is, after all, the only man in the whole thirty-six
possessing merits of any description which can justly be characterised
as eminent in their kind.* The men of letters of France are represented
solely by Count Philippe de Ségur.3 But the most egregious as well as
the most ominous inconsequence is this—in a list of peers, created on
purpose to carry a bill, abolishing the inheritableness of the peerage,
are included persons whose only claim to that rank consists in the
merits of their fathers. We allude to young Ney, Prince de la Moskwa,
and to M. Bernard Foy.4

The minister has raised a storm by this proceeding, which appears to
have taken our newspapers by surprise, though expected by all who have
any acquaintance with French politics. The opposition intend to urge
with their whole strength in the Chamber of Deputies a motion condemning
this exercise of the royal prerogative. They contend that the creation
of peers, while the article of the charter, which empowered such a
creation, is actually undergoing revision, is beyond the legitimate
powers of the executive, and, in fact, constitutes a coup d’état. We
know not whether they will maintain that it is actually illegal, or
merely unconstitutional; a violation of the written laws, or only of the
unwritten maxims which jointly form the constitution of a state. The
latter are as obligatory as the former upon a minister, and the breach
of either would be an equally just ground for addressing the King to
remove him.

It may be thought captious in the opposition to look so closely into the
means adopted to carry an alteration in the constitution of the peerage,
so earnestly demanded by themselves. To this we answer, that the
opposition had gained their Edition: current; Page: [366] point from the
moment when the Chamber of Deputies, by a majority of six or seven to
one, had given their sanction to the doctrine of the unfitness of
hereditary legislation to the present state of society, and of the human
mind.5 The solemn recognition of this great principle was all the
opposition wanted; whether the bill actually passes or not, they regard
as of altogether secondary importance; for the hereditary chamber is so
utterly discredited by this authoritative condemnation of its principle,
that a breath will at any time sweep it away, if it should ever become
an active obstruction to good legislation. And as for any practical good
from the passing of the bill, if they have hitherto expected such a
thing—which very few of them ever did, from a chamber nominated by the
crown; this contemptible list of nominations must have completely
altered their opinion.

It is now, at best, a matter of indifference to the opposition whether
the bill passes or not. But if it is to pass, they contend, as they have
always contended, that the Chamber of Deputies has a right to pass it,
without the Peers, by their own sole authority as a constituent body.
This, their opponents say, is unconstitutional. They answer, that it
would be so, as a general rule; neither ought any article of the charter
to be revised by a legislature elected by virtue of the charter, but
only by a constituent Assembly or Convention elected for that express
purpose. But it is a fact, that the Chamber of Deputies did, in August,
1830, take upon themselves the powers of a constituent body. They
elected a king, and revised the entire charter. One article, that
relating to the Peerage, they did not alter at the time; but formally
reserved it to be altered now.6 This, therefore, is a peculiar case. In
making the alteration by their own single authority, the popular branch
of the legislature would merely continue and complete its own former
act. On this principle the measure ought to have originated with the
Chamber. The King himself did wrong in introducing the present bill. The
King has, properly, no more to do with the revision of this article than
he had with that of all the other articles, a year and a half ago. The
King has no voice in making the constitution: it is tendered to him, and
he simply accepts it; or else rejects it, and abdicates the throne.

The Chamber has waived its right as a constituent body, and thought fit
to pass, with amendments, a bill presented by the Crown; and if the
Peers also think fit to pass it, the Deputies will not object. But if
the Peers reject it, then, says the opposition, is the time for the
Chamber of Deputies to exert their constituent power. They have not
claimed it: they have preferred not to raise the question. With that
hope they have passed the measure in the forms of any ordinary law; but
as it was optional at first, so it is at any time in their power to
claim the right they have for the moment waived, and declare, that in
the exercise of that right, Edition: current; Page: [367] they adopt
either this or some other measure, and it becomes part of the
constitution of France.

While this dispute is going on, the King has afforded the first example,
since the establishment of a representative Government in 1814,7 of the
refusal of the royal sanction to a bill which has passed the two
Chambers. The bill in question was for restoring the military grades
conferred by Napoleon, during the hundred days.8 If there is any part of
French history of which all Frenchmen ought to be ashamed, it is the
second usurpation of Napoleon; and nothing can be more foolish than to
revive, and hold as valid, these acts of the usurper, which were set
aside by the government which succeeded him. Many, indeed, of those who
supported the bill, did so upon the principle that military rank,
conferred by a Government de facto, is property, and that he who is
deprived of it, on whatever pretext, suffers a wrong. Allowing this,
however, the wrong was committed sixteen years ago; and why should one
class of sufferers be compensated at the expense of the state,—partly,
therefore, at the charge of many other classes of sufferers, whose
wrongs go unredressed? The principle is untenable; it is the same upon
which Villèle grounded the indemnity to the emigrants.9

an insurrection has taken place at Lyons.1 The silk-weavers have risen
in arms; and how the greater part of those arms were obtained is still a
mystery; after two, or, according to some accounts, three days’ fighting
against the National Guard and the troops, they have remained masters of
the town. The Edition: current; Page: [368] following description of
their subsequent conduct, which we copy from the Times, is corroborated
by every authentic account which has been received:

It is universally admitted that there has been no plunder or bloodshed
beyond the two days, the 21st and 22d ultimo; that when the civil power
had been overthrown, and the military force expelled, the directing
chiefs of the workmen felt the necessity of order, and the utility of
the laws which they had violated; that they had enacted severe penalties
against pillagers, murderers, and disturbers; that they had appointed
sentinels to protect the persons and magazines of their employers, whom
they had overcome in the struggle; that they had placed themselves in
amicable relations with the préfets and mayors, whom they had at first
deposed; and that the city exhibited the strange and anomalous
appearance of being at once loyal and rebellious—of uniting insurrection
with legitimate authority—of maintaining a profound peace between
hostile camps, and in the midst of civil contention. Those who had
discarded the civil magistrate, who had beaten the troops of the line
and the National Guard, acting under the magistracy, seem horrified at
the very idea of being considered bad subjects, and loudly protest their
“entire devotion to their citizen King, Louis Philip.”2

The Courrier Français might well say, “Même lorsqu’il est livré au plus
terrible égarement, il y a maintenant chez le peuple français un
instinct social qu’on ne rencontrerait dans aucun autre pays: certes, il
y a loin des ouvriers de Lyon montant la garde avec les bourgeois, à la
populace de Bristol se souillant des plus monstrueux excès.”3
Nevertheless, to moderate the honest triumph of the French journalist,
and to avoid doing injustice to the morality and self-control of our own
working classes, it is well to remark, that the outrages at Bristol were
perpetrated by a very small fraction of the very worst part of the
populace, mostly thieves, and other criminals by profession;4 who, in
our great towns, owing to the defects of our police and criminal
judicature, are more numerous in proportion to the population than in
any other civilized community. If the affair at Bristol had been not a
riot, but a general insurrection, events, even there, would have taken a
far different turn. The superiority, in such emergencies, of the French
working classes over ours, seems to consist less in their greater virtue
or good sense, as compared with the corresponding class among our own
people, than in that extraordinary power of extemporaneous organization,
which belongs to the superior quickness and readiness of the French
character, and to the military habits of a large proportion of the
people. Englishmen, it is probable, could not have jumped out of anarchy
into order by one leap, like the Lyonnese. But if a crisis should come,
which we trust England may never know, but which we should never
intermit to think of and be prepared Edition: current; Page: [369]
for—if events like those of Lyons should, at any future period, take
place at Manchester or Glasgow, or any other of our great towns where
the people, by means of their Benefit Societies and Trade Unions, are
accustomed to concert, and organize under chiefs whom they know, a new
government would be ready at once to take the place of that which had
been subverted; and though manifold horrors would too probably be
perpetrated during the conflict, the moment it was over we are persuaded
that these places would become as orderly and peaceful as Lyons at this
moment.

The origin of the popular movement at Lyons, was what, in this country,
would be termed a strike for wages. For some time past, the silks of
France have been in a great degree supplanted in the foreign market by
those of England and Switzerland.* The Lyonnese manufacturers,
therefore, in attempting to maintain the competition, found themselves
under the necessity of lowering wages. To this pre-existing pressure,
was added that arising from the unsettled state of France during the
last two years. The suspension of purchasers from want of confidence,
which created the commercial distress, naturally fell heaviest upon
articles like silk, of ornament and luxury. After long bearing their
evils with exemplary patience, the workmen at last demanded an advance
of wages. The Préfet, with that pestilent spirit of busy intermeddling,
of which French officials can never divest themselves, sanctioned the
increased rate of wages by an authoritative proclamation.5 The
consequence was what might have been foreseen. Magistrates may fix a
scale of wages, but it is beyond the power of any magistrate to compel
the manufacturers to pay it. The employers could not afford to
manufacture at a loss; they accordingly discharged their men, and the
insurrection followed.

Troops will, of course, march against Lyons, and the revolt will be put
down. But we do hope, though we scarcely dare expect, that the
legislators of France, Edition: current; Page: [370] after this warning,
will bethink themselves, and lay it to heart, that to pay some attention
to the physical well-being of the class which composes
fifteen-sixteenths of the whole nation, is really part of the duty of a
Government. The Morning Chronicle will tell us, that the language we now
use is mischievous, tending to make the working classes believe that
their condition depends not upon themselves, but upon the Government.
Undoubtedly any language would be mischievous, which should persuade the
people that the Government could fix the rate of wages. But, without
being able to raise wages, the Government has the power of making the
present rate of wages sufficient for the subsistence of the labourers.

The French Government, with a reckless fiscality equal to that of the
worst Ministries of our worst times, derives the greater part of its
immense revenue, both general and local, from duties on the articles
consumed by the great body of the people. The taxes which fall upon the
most numerous and poorest class, yield most to the revenue; and this is
all which a mere financier, either in France or in England, ever
troubles himself with. It has been proved again and again, that the tax
on salt, that on wine (which is to the French labourer what beer is to
the English), the monopoly of tobacco, the octroi or town duties on all
kinds of agricultural produce, and various other burthens imposed by the
French system of finance, fall not only with greatest comparative, but
with greatest absolute weight, upon those who are least able to bear it.
A poor family actually pays a greater number of francs to the revenue,
one year with another, on account of these taxes, than a rich family.
Yet, whenever a voice has been raised (and few and faint have been such
voices) in the late or present Chamber of Deputies, for the alleviation
of these intolerable exactions, the sound has either been merely
re-echoed from the bare walls, or has been drowned in clamour.

Were these taxes taken off, the silk-weavers of Lyons might be able to
live, at least without danger of famine, upon such wages as their
employers could allow consistently with being able to sell their fabrics
in the northern markets at the same price with other nations.

Further, since the year 1821, a corn law, worse than our corn laws when
at their worst, has artificially raised the price of food in all the
manufacturing parts of France; and considerably more so in Lyons than in
other places,—the importation price being, by the absurd provisions of
the law, different in different districts.6 The French Ministry has
lately proposed to the legislature a slight relaxation of this system;
and the committee appointed by the Chamber of Deputies to examine the
bill, have named for their President M. de Saint-Cricq, and for their
Secretary M. Charles Dupin!7 They might have hunted through France for
men more inveterately averse to free trade, and found none.

Edition: current; Page: [371]
Not only the food of the labourer, but almost every other article of his
consumption which is not raised in price by excise duties, is so by
restrictions on trade. The cottons in which he does, or might, clothe
himself and his family, he must not import from England (save at an
enormous duty), but must purchase a bad and dear article produced at
home. If the woollens in which he clothes himself are foreign, they have
paid a high duty, to protect French manufactures; if French, they have
paid a high duty on the raw material, to protect French agriculture. If
he purchases French manufactures of any description, they are dear and
bad, because made by dear and bad machinery, owing to prohibitory duties
on foreign iron; the iron of France being of notoriously bad quality,
and the mines far from productive: but this is for the protection of
French mining and French forests. The sugar and coffee which the poor
silk-weaver consumes, he must pay for at an immense increase of price,
to protect French beet-root, and to save from ruin three little islands,
Martinique, Guadaloupe, and Bourbon; the fee simple of all three not
being worth ten years purchase of the tax annually levied, on their
account, from the consumers of colonial produce. Finally, even live
cattle cannot be driven into France from beyond the Rhine, except at an
enormous duty; and a riot took place only a few weeks since, at
Strasburg, on this very account.

All these evils the French Ministry, and the leaders of the Opposition,
are fully alive to, and would gladly remedy if they were able. But the
Minister dares not propose an alteration of this monstrous system, to a
Chamber composed of cotton and woollen manufacturers, and proprietors of
forests and mines.

The dissatisfaction of the people, we know, does not always take the
right side; but they are seldom dissatisfied without good cause. What is
a Government for, but to find the means of removing evils which the
people themselves, either from ignorance or want of power, are unable to
cope with? If a Government did its duty to the people—if it never
inflicted evil upon any part of them, save for the general good—if it
showed itself always eager to search out the causes of their suffering,
and administer remedies where remedies were practicable—if it let the
people see that, where it had the means of doing aught to serve them, it
wanted not the will,—very rarely would it find the people unreasonable
in their demands, or expecting impossibilities. The working classes are
not like their enervated and effeminate superiors; they are accustomed
to suffering, and exercised in endurance. Evil is no new thing to them;
and their habit is, to regard it as inherent in their lot. Let them but
see common sympathy, and a very little active goodwill, in those whom
society has placed over their heads, and they are even more ready than
they should be to let themselves be persuaded that their sufferings are
inevitable, and that governments can do nothing for them.

the duke of orleans and Marshal Soult have entered Lyons without
resistance; and regular government is to appearance restored.1 On what
conditions the insurgents have submitted, is not known; and what will be
the dénouement of this singular drama, no one can predict.

The Moniteur, and the papers in the Ministerial interest, talk so big,
that one would imagine the revolt of the second city in the kingdom was
a glorious tribute to the wisdom of the Government, and the surest
guarantee of its stability.2

A most disgraceful disclosure has been made before the tribunals of the
low tricks by which the Périer Ministry attempts to maintain itself in
office. It is completely proved, that numbers of the poorer workmen were
regularly hired by the police, at three francs a-head, to assist in
putting down the young men who attempted to plant a tree of liberty on
the anniversary of the destruction of the Bastille. The brutal violence
which was displayed by these bought auxiliaries had excited much
disgust; and the fact of their having been regularly enrolled and paid,
was asserted in two newspapers, the National and the Tribune. These
papers were accordingly prosecuted, at the suit of M. Casimir Périer and
M. Vivien, who was at the head of the police when these occurrences
happened.3 But so clearly was the truth of the accusation made out, that
M. Vivien abandoned his share of the prosecution, and the accused have
been acquitted.

There was much vapouring in the Moniteur, about that time, on the
hostility of the working classes to the “agitators” and “eternal enemies
of order,” evidenced Edition: current; Page: [373] by the voluntary
assistance given by them in suppressing what the Ministry was pleased to
call anarchy.4 The world will now know what value to set on the
assertions of the official journal.

The Chamber is slowly winding its way through a long projet de loi for
mitigating the penal code. This bill when adopted will be some
improvement on the existing law, but not a very material one. It
deserves attention chiefly from the provision which it contains for
incorporating the new enactments in the text of the code.5 We fear it
will be long before our legislators will have the wisdom to learn from
the French the art of drawing up their laws.

It is well understood that the people of Paris will no longer permit the
punishment of death to be inflicted in that place. Preparations were
commenced a few weeks since in the Place de Grève for a public
execution, but the intention was abandoned in consequence of the strong
manifestations of public disgust which it excited. The Parisians will
not endure that the lives of any other criminals should be taken, when,
to save those of Polignac and his accomplices, the Chamber of Deputies
and the King united in expressing a wish for the abolition of capital
punishment.6

lyons appears to be in a state of complete pacification.1 Marshal Soult,
by virtue of the extraordinary powers with which he was invested, has
set aside the tariff, or scale of wages, the ineffectual attempt to
enforce which, was the cause of the insurrection. It is now, therefore,
manifest, that the submission of the workmen has not been purchased by
any improper concessions on the subject of interference between them and
their employers. No injustice has been promised to the workmen—it
remains to be seen whether justice will be done. We shall see Edition:
current; Page: [374] what measures the Ministry has to propose, for the
alleviation of the burthens which press upon the poorer classes, and for
increasing the demand for their labour, by removing the obstacles which
stupid legislation has interposed to prevent capital from flowing into
the most productive channels.

The French papers of the last week are replete with interesting matter.

A trial has commenced before one of the Paris tribunals, implicating,
most seriously, the private character of the individual who now fills
the French throne. We allude to the application of the heir-at-law of
the late Duc de Bourbon, that the will by which that prince bequeathed
the bulk of his immense property to the third son of the King of the
French, may be set aside.2 We shall take care that the disclosures of
which this law-suit is the occasion, shall, when complete, be fully made
known to the English public. It is sufficient now to say, that unless
the evidence to be hereafter produced shall greatly alter the present
complexion of the case, the French people have fastened upon themselves
as their ruler, a man not only unfit to reign, but scarcely fit to live.

Several important proceedings have taken place in the Chamber of
Deputies.

The bill for the mitigation of the Penal Code3 has passed the Chamber; a
clause having first been inserted, by which the law attaching penalties
to the assumption of a title of nobility, unless conferred by the King,
is repealed. Any person, therefore, may now give himself whatever title
he chooses, without incurring any consequences, except the forfeiture of
the nickname in case any one should take the trouble to prosecute him
for assuming it. Titles were already sufficiently ridiculous in France;
as they cannot fail to become every where, when they are shared by many
thousands of persons, and have ceased to be connected with any civil or
political privileges. Except the émigrés, and the survivors of the old
court, few persons who possess titles ever assume or claim them. They
will now, we imagine, fall into utter desuetude.

In addition to the law for the modification of the penal code, the
Chamber has adopted another law, of very considerable importance. The
object of this is the introduction of the warehousing system, which,
strange to say, did not before Edition: current; Page: [375] exist, or
only to a very limited extent, in France.4 The present law permits those
articles, (with, however, a very numerous list of exceptions) the
importation of which is either prohibited or subjected to a duty, to be
imported and warehoused for re-exportation either from the same or from
some other port or frontier place, without payment of duty. In the
debates on this law, several members expressed opinions highly
favourable to free trade; but what is still more encouraging, is the
mitigated tone of the enemies of that great principle.5 Not one of them
(except the unconvinceable M. Charles Dupin)6 contended that the
restrictive system was not in itself an evil. They went no further than
to recommend that it should not be altered suddenly, but gradually, with
due regard to existing interests, and in concert with foreign powers. On
the whole, we cannot doubt, from the signs of public opinion in France,
that the era is approaching of a great relaxation in the prohibitive
laws of that country.

A motion has been made by M. Auguste Portalis, and seems likely to be
adopted, for abrogating the compulsory observance of Sundays and
holidays.7 We should greatly deprecate such a proposition in our own
country. We are convinced, that it would lead, and that speedily, to but
one result: the labourer would perform the labour of seven days, for the
wages which he now receives for that of six; and would be deprived of
all the enjoyment, and of the innumerable moral advantages attendant on
periodical repose. But we do not anticipate these baneful consequences
from the measure which is now proposed in France. The experiment has in
fact been tried, and no such consequences have been produced: for the
observance of the Sunday, in so far as it is compulsory, has long been
practically at an end. The French people are often not better fed or
clothed than the English; but in no case are they so much over-worked.
They will not submit to be so. They will live upon brown bread, which an
English workman will not; but they will not work fourteen hours a day,
which an English workman will; nor seven days in the week, which an
English workman would. The English are not reduced to a potato diet,
because they will not marry and multiply their species on such terms;
and the French save themselves by the same means, from being worn down
and brought to a premature death by incessant toil. Would that the
English might do the like!

The same deputy has proposed, with the same prospect of success, to
abolish Edition: current; Page: [376] the solemnization of the
anniversary of Louis XVI’s execution.8 The object of this motion is to
get rid of all the remaining traces which the doctrine of legitimacy or
divine right has left in the French laws. A great majority of the French
public, and probably all the members of the Chamber of Deputies,
disapproved of the conduct of the Convention in putting Louis XVI to
death. But they see no reason why this particular act of injustice
should be selected as a subject of national humiliation and penance,
more than any one among the many judicial assassinations committed
during the reign of terror upon far worthier men; or than the execution
of the unfortunate Lally, for example, under the old regime, or of
Marshal Ney, in 1815, in violation of the capitulation of Paris.9 There
was nothing in the case of Louis XVI to distinguish him from any other
person who is improperly put to death on a charge of treason, except the
circumstance of his being a king. And this does not in any way add to
the degree of guilt in the estimation of Frenchmen, or rational persons
of any other country, unless they are believers in divine right.

A third motion of importance has been made by M. Salverte, and is likely
to be adopted in France, as it must ultimately be in the legislative
assemblies of all other countries: this is, that all bills which, having
passed through some of their stages, are lost, not by being negatived,
but by the prorogation of the Chambers, may be resumed in the ensuing
session (unless a dissolution has intervened) at the point at which
their progress had been interrupted.10

m. casimir périer has read to the two Chambers a long report on the
affair of Lyons.1 In this document, he does not state a single fact
which was not previously known, nor give intimation of any intentions
which had not been already expressed. He commences with a loud flourish
of trumpets, and undertakes to enter fully into the subject of existing
evils and their remedies, yet, for aught we can discover, his
portefeuille may be overflowing with great projects for the promotion of
the public prosperity, or he may meditate nothing but to sit with his
arms folded, and consume his salary. All which this production discloses
of the state of his mind, is a vehement inclination to have it thought
that his conduct is highly praiseworthy.

This empty document, however, afforded an occasion which was sure to be
eagerly seized, for a violent debate on the general policy of the
Ministry; and the debate has accordingly commenced, and promises to last
several days.2

These demonstrations of party hostility are however becoming less and
less frequent; while debates on specific questions are rapidly
increasing in frequency and interest. The Opposition will speedily find
that their true policy, both for themselves and the good of their
country, is to load the President’s table with motions for
well-considered and practicable improvements, and concert together to
secure upon each a vigorous and well-sustained debate; acquiring for
themselves the éclat of suggesting measures, which the Ministry may
afterwards adopt, or throwing upon M. Périer and his majority, the odium
of resisting improvement.

We see reason to expect a stormy debate on the Corn Law.3 In the French
Chamber, even more than in our own House of Commons, the great landed
proprietors predominate, and seem equally disposed with our own
squirearchy, to hold fast to their usurpations. The Ministry and the
Opposition will fight side by side against a large portion of the
phalanx by which the Ministers are usually supported. Some say that the
question will be postponed to the next session; and Edition: current;
Page: [378] really, if it is not, we fear the Ministry will have a hard
account to settle with the great “practical authorities” of their party,
M. Humann4 and M. Charles Dupin.

An excellent speech on the corn question has been made incidentally in
the course of another debate, by M. Laguette-Mornay.5

The Commission on the budget has not yet completed its labours. Those
members of the Opposition who formed part of it, among others MM.
Laffitte, Bignon,6 and Dupont de l’Eure, have at length discontinued
their attendance, disgusted at the absolute failure of their attempts to
extort from the majority any considerable diminution of the public
expenditure. The impossibility of voting the budget before the
conclusion of the year, has compelled the Ministry to solicit from the
Chamber the continuance of the existing taxes and expenses for three
months longer. This has been agreed to, but under a proviso of a novel
and highly important nature: that if in the budget when voted, any
salary, pension, or other allowance shall be reduced, the reduction
shall take effect retrospectively from the beginning of the year.7 The
parties interested being thus forewarned, will of course make their
arrangements accordingly.

We mentioned in our last paper, that the Chamber had already adopted one
law for the extension of the warehousing system:8 it has now under its
consideration another.9 The former law related to goods warehoused for
re-exportation: the present, has reference to warehousing for home
consumption. In France, as in England, articles which have been imported
are allowed to remain under the King’s lock, jointly with that of the
owner, and to be bought and sold in the warehouse as often as a
purchaser can be found; the duty being demanded only when the goods are
taken out to be finally sold for consumption. The advantage of this
arrangement to the merchant, we need not insist upon, and the advantage
to the nation is not less. A large portion of the trading capital of the
country is allowed to remain in active employment, when it would
otherwise be locked up unproductively, being paid into the hands of
Government, and not reimbursed until the goods were sold, which might
not be till long after they were imported.

This privilege however, of warehousing goods without payment of duties,
has hitherto, in France, been confined to the few sea-ports, and to
certain frontier towns. Paris itself, and all the other places in the
interior, are excluded from it. Edition: current; Page: [379] The object
of the measure now proposed by the Ministry, is, to extend to other
places the advantage at present enjoyed exclusively by the sea-ports and
frontier towns. The bill accordingly encounters a noisy opposition from
the members for the privileged places, and there seems to be some doubt
whether it will be suffered to pass.

A bill has been adopted by the Chamber of Deputies, almost without
opposition, for re-establishing the dissolubility of the marriage
contract.10 This bill restores the law of divorce, not as it stood
during the Revolution, but nearly on the footing on which it was placed
by the Code Napoleon. Divorce must be pronounced by a court of justice.
It will be granted at the instance of either party, in certain cases
which are nearly the same with those in which the tribunals will now
grant a separation. Divorce by mutual consent will also be allowed; but
this likewise must be pronounced by a tribunal: there must be a long
period of probation; the parties, once divorced, cannot again be united;
and half their property must be settled on their offspring. On the
whole, this measure seems to do as much as can be done by any means
hitherto proposed, towards solving the difficulty of allowing marriages
to be dissolved where their continuance is a source of insupportable
evil, and at the same time avoiding to afford inducements to forming so
important an engagement without a reasonable prospect of its permanency.

The Commission of the Chamber of Peers has at length presented to that
Chamber its report on the new law relative to the peerage.11 The members
of the Commission were equally divided in opinion; but their reporter,
the Duke Decazes, is in favour of the law. An alteration, however, is
proposed, which will enable the Ministry, if they think proper, to
render the abolition of the inheritableness a nullity.

Among the categories, or classes of persons, to whom the Commission of
the Chamber of Deputies proposed that the nomination to peerages should
be limited,—one consisted of landed proprietors or chiefs of commercial
establishments, paying 3000 francs of direct taxes. The Chamber, not
being of opinion that riches were of themselves a sufficient
qualification for a legislator, required as a further condition that the
persons belonging to this category should have served for six years as
members of a municipal council or a chamber of commerce, both which
functions are conferred by popular election. This Edition: current;
Page: [380] amendment, though violently resisted by the Ministers and
their adherents, was carried against them. The Commission of the Chamber
of Peers now recommend that it should be struck out.

Should this recommendation be adopted, of which we fear there is little
doubt, the eldest sons of Peers will generally be eligible to succeed
their fathers. It is true that the general law of succession in France
divides the property of the parent equally among all the children.12 But
one of the acts of the Bourbons, after their restoration, was to permit
the creation of majorats, or entails, to accompany a title of nobility;
and to require, in particular, that the Peers should, as a matter of
course, tie up a certain amount of property, and transmit it to the next
heir, together with the Peerage, which otherwise, should not be
transmissible.13 The eldest son of a Peer, in consequence, generally
succeeds his father in the bulk of his landed property, and therefore in
the payment of the bulk of his direct taxes. It is worthy of remark,
that a ministerial deputy, M. Jaubert, at a very early period of the
present session, laid upon the table a proposition for the abolition of
majorats.14 It was received with universal approbation, but a day has
never yet been fixed for the discussion of it, nor has it been referred
to a Commission; and there is every appearance of an intention to allow
it to drop.

That the Ministers will generally name the successor to the estate as
successor also to the peerage, if the law allows them, they have taken
care to leave no doubt, by naming the sons of Ney and of General Foy;15
young men who have not had time to shew themselves either fit for the
office, or worthy of the honour; one of them not even of age, and
neither having attained the age of thirty, before which, by the
regulation of the Chamber, they are not permitted to vote;16 and this,
too, although the recent creation of Peers was for the express purpose
of outnumbering a hostile majority.

We have given in another part of our paper an abridgment of the law
proceedings relative to the will of the Duke de Bourbon.17 We invite
particular attention to it. The defence not having yet been heard, nor
the witnesses examined, we forbear any further comment in this stage.

the abolition of the Hereditary Peerage of France has passed the Chamber
of Peers by a majority about equal in number to the new creation of
Peers.1 The majority of speakers was, however, on the contrary side; and
even of those who supported the bill, there was not one who did not
openly lament the necessity of passing it.

The debate in the Chamber of Deputies occasioned by M. Périer’s
statement respecting the revolt of Lyons,2 continued during four days.
M. Périer, not denying that there was misconduct somewhere, threw the
whole blame upon the local authorities: for which M. Bouvier du Molart,
préfet of the Rhone, took a public opportunity of giving him the lie.3
After this proceeding, M. du Molart threw up his office, was struck off
the roll of the Conseil d’Etat, and being thus freed from all connexion
with the administration, commenced publishing in the newspapers a series
of letters, of a highly interesting character, on the recent events.4

Omitting so much of the controversy, as consists only in crimination and
recrimination between M. Périer and M. du Molart personally, we shall
merely afford our readers the benefit of such light as is thrown by the
disclosures now made, upon the causes of the insurrection.

The disturbances originated as the public are aware, in a tariff or
scale of increased wages, promulgated under the sanction of the préfet;
which was observed for a few days, but afterwards departed from by a
portion of the manufacturers, who stopped their works, and refused to
give employment to Edition: current; Page: [382] their workmen at the
increased rate. Hereupon the operatives, who had previously had full
confidence in the continuance of the tariff, and who, to use the
expression of M. du Molart, regarded it as their charter, considered
themselves to be cruelly injured; and their resentment broke out, in the
manner which the public already know.

It now appears that when M. Périer was apprised of the promulgation of
the tariff, he made an official intimation to M. du Molart of his
disapprobation of it; and desired him, if possible, to allow it to fall
into desuetude. This was imposing upon the préfet rather a difficult
task; and we cannot be much surprised that no better result should have
come of it.

M. du Molart, however, denies the circumstance, upon which the
impropriety of the tariff principally depends. He denies that it was
prescribed by the authority of government. He affirms, that it was the
result of a free compact, concluded between delegates from the workmen,
and delegates from the manufacturers; that a small minority only of the
manufacturers had any objection to it; that these waived their
objection; and that he, the civil magistrate, took no further part in
the mutual agreement, than that of attesting and promulgating it. That
on receiving M. Périer’s despatch, he hastened to lay before him the
real state of the case, and hoped to induce him to withdraw his
disapproval: but that in the meanwhile, the fact that the conduct of the
préfet had been disapproved of, oozed out of the public offices at Paris
(he says it was even mentioned by M. d’Argout, the minister of commerce,
to the deputies for the place): that the news found its way to Lyons,
and encouraged that small portion of the manufacturers who had
originally disapproved of the tariff, to declare open hostility to it,
some of them in a manner most unfeeling and insulting as respected the
common people. Hereupon the revolt ensued. The conduct of M. du Molart
throughout the trying circumstances in which he was afterwards placed,
appears from all accounts to have been worthy of a hero.

If the statements of the ex-préfet are correct, it would seem that the
fault, if any, imputable to him, was chiefly that of having taken any
part in the convention between employers and workmen, even as a mere
attesting witness, without first ascertaining that his conduct would
meet with the approbation of his superiors. How far the blame of this
want of concurrence between the government and its agent, lies with the
agent, is a question which seems mainly to depend upon a despatch, which
M. du Molart affirms that he wrote and sent, and which the minister
denies having received. By what strange misadventure the two statements
can both come to be true, or which of the two parties asserts a
falsehood, we have no materials for conjecture.

A remarkable circumstance is, that M. du Molart denies the existence of
any peculiar stagnation in the manufactures of Lyons. He affirms on the
contrary, that they are in a state of unusual activity.

Edition: current; Page: [383]
The late political events, [says he,] which have in general exercised so
unfavourable an influence over mercantile affairs, have had little
effect upon the manufactures of Lyons. There has been no want of
employment, thanks to immense orders given by the Americans. The year
1829 was that of the greatest activity of the manufacture, which reached
almost 600,000 kilogrammes. The year following the revolution, from July
1830 to July 1831, fell short of this maximum by no more than 15,000
kilogrammes. Not only all the workmen have been constantly employed, but
the length of their day’s work has been greatly increased, and six
thousand machines have remained idle for want of hands. In this
situation, however, the workmen complained; they addressed respectful
petitions to the authorities; they assembled with order, calmness, and
decency, in a private house; they named a committee to state and support
their claims. Public opinion was in their favour; they inspired general
interest, and all the manufacturers of proper feelings admitted, that
these unfortunate people, by working eighteen hours a-day, did not gain
even enough to sustain life.5

This is very unlike what has been stated in all other quarters, as to
the decline of the trade; and M. du Molart, it must be remembered, is
strongly interested in making out a case for that rise of wages, to
which, in an evil hour for the city of Lyons, he gave his official
authority. This statement, however, is specific; and being in figures,
may be disproved if not correct. It is important that the truth should
be known.

If M. du Molart’s statement is correct, a rise of wages was warranted by
the state of the trade; but also, it would have been brought about by
the state of the trade without his interference, and then it is likely
the workmen might not have considered the new law of wages as “their
charter,” justifying insurrection, like that of Paris, if it were
violated. Wages at starvation point, and six thousand looms standing
still for want of workmen, are two circumstances, M. du Molart may be
assured, which could not have gone on for many days together. We
confess, the fact that any number of the manufacturers should have
dismissed their workmen rather than pay the advance of wages, throws
very great doubt in our minds upon M. du Molart’s assertion, that the
increased scale was called for by the prosperity of the trade.

Under all suppositions as to this matter, the practical conclusion is
one and the same. There exists unhappily no doubt as to the miserably
low wages of the Lyons’ operatives. They are admitted to be in
consequence the worst fed, sallowest, and feeblest in bodily frame, of
all the working people of France. Now, there is not a single article of
importance consumed by the labourer, which is not taxed to an enormous
amount, either for revenue or protection. His clothes are taxed by the
duties on cottons and woollens; his fire is taxed by the high price of
wood occasioned by the duties on iron, his bread and his meat are taxed
by the duties on corn and cattle, for purposes of protection. His wine,
(which corresponds to our small beer) is taxed, his salt is taxed, his
only luxury, Edition: current; Page: [384] tobacco, is raised by a
monopoly many hundred per cent. in price, and all articles of
agricultural produce are taxed over again by the octroi, for purposes of
revenue. The genius of fiscality has exhausted every device by which the
iron hand of the tax-gatherer can be driven hard and deep into the
pockets of the very poorest class; who being in a still greater ratio
the most numerous class, are the payers of the most productive taxes.

Let the government do its duty on all these points; let it abstain from
robbing the people for its own benefit, or for the benefit of
landholders and great capitalists; and it may leave the question between
them and their employers to be adjusted between them and their
employers. How much of the great concerns of society may or may not be
brought within the functions of government, when government shall be
something very different from what it is, it would be premature for us
to decide. But we are sure, that as governments are at present
constituted, the less they have to do with the regulation of contracts
between man and man the better for society; and the more strictly they
confine themselves to the mere protection of person and property from
force or fraud, the better they know their proper stations, and the more
good, or rather the less intolerable evil they produce.

But of all these matters M. du Molart is so far from being sensible,
that while he thinks the regulation of wages quite a proper subject for
the interference of authority, he is a declared partisan of the droits
réunis, as preferable to direct taxation; and goes so far as to condemn
even the trifling alleviation of the duties on wine, which was granted
at the close of 1830, when the wine countries on the south were in a
state in which the tax could not otherwise have been collected but at
the bayonet’s point. M. du Molart was one of Bonaparte’s préfets; and
this, to any one who knows what these were, means, that in the eyes of
M. du Molart, the only one requisite of a good tax, is to be productive
to the revenue. We mistake; there is another virtue, namely, to take the
people’s money as it were while they are asleep, and without their being
sensible who takes it. This is the ground of the preference for indirect
taxes.

M. Fiévée, who knew this kind of men well, divides them into two
classes: the teachers of Bonaparte, and his pupils. Such men as M. du
Molart belong to the latter class. It was of them (and more especially
of M. Louis, the present minister of finance) that M. Fiévée, writing at
a time when these very men were in power, said, “Je connais bien nos
administrateurs actuels: ils sont d’une fiscalité qui déconcertait
quelquefois Napoléon, le plus fiscal des hommes.”6 Apt scholars, who
surpassed even their schoolmaster.

The debate on the budget will commence in a few days. We shall then see
what the sages of the Palais-Bourbon will think proper to do with the
Taxes on Poverty. As for the Corn Bill, poor and insignificant as is the
palliative which it Edition: current; Page: [385] offers of a radically
pernicious principle of legislation, there seems to be a general
understanding that the Landlords’ House (for such the Chamber of
Deputies truly is) will not pass it this session.7 It cannot come on
before the budget, and when the budget is passed, it is expected that
the Chambers will be prorogued, leaving all other questions in statu
quo.

In the mean time, two commissions of the Chamber, on two very important
bills, have presented reports more liberal (a rare occurrence) than the
original scheme. One of these bills is the highly important one for
national education.8 A majority of the commission on this bill consisted
(Heaven knows how!) of members of the Opposition; including several of
the most respected leaders, with the venerable M. Daunou at their head.
This eminent patriot, eminent alike by his talents and his virtues, was
named the reporter of the commission; and though we have not yet seen
his report, there can be no doubt of the benevolent and enlightened
character of a document on such a subject, emanating from the founder of
the Institute of France.9 The ministry, we perceive, are violently
adverse to some of the amendments which he proposes.

The other bill to which we have alluded, is for defining the functions
of the municipal councils: the composition of those bodies, by popular
election, having been provided for by a law passed in the preceding
session.10 The ministerial projet, though it modified to a certain
extent, maintained in all its main features Napoleon’s system of
centralization;11 that system which, while it crushed the provinces
under the oppressive weight of the metropolis, rendered the fit
performance of public business impossible: the local authorities not
having power to perform the most trifling act of administration (unless
it were a matter of mere routine) without orders from Paris, which, in
consequence of the immense quantity of such business which flowed in and
accumulated, they often had to wait months for, the exigency in the mean
time passing away, and endless mischiefs occurring for want of doing
that which could not under this system be sooner done. The report of the
commission proposes a far greater alteration in the existing system, and
confers upon the inhabitants of the different localities, through their
local representatives, a far greater share in the management of their
local affairs, than the scheme of the Government.

Let us hope that leisure will be found for disposing of these two great
Edition: current; Page: [386] questions before the prorogation; or at
all events that by the adoption of M. Salverte’s proposition with
respect to dropped bills,12 they may be allowed to come on at once for
discussion at the opening of the following session; which cannot be long
after the close of the present, for it takes three months to vote a
budget, and the budget of 1833 has also to be voted in 1832. The
deputies of France, by the way, take their legislative duties rather
coolly; a sitting of five hours seems to be the very longest which they
ever allow themselves. One night’s debating in the House of Commons,
from four in the afternoon to three in the morning, is equivalent to
nearly a week’s exertions of the French Chamber. It is true that their
deputies are obliged to be more regular in attendance than members of
the English Parliament, as the Chamber cannot deliberate unless a
majority of its whole members be present.13

The commission on the civil list has not yet presented its report.14
This question must, by the terms of the Charter be disposed of in the
present session.15 It is true that there is little need for being in any
hurry to vote money to the Citizen King, as he is already expending
provisionally a far larger sum per month than any Chamber, not having
arrived at the last stage of profligate impudence, will venture
permanently to grant to him. Statements have been made, which, if not
refuted, prove that the expenses on account of the civil list since the
accession of Louis-Philippe have amounted to nearly forty millions of
francs; fully as much as Charles X ever expended in the same time, and
greatly exceeding the eighteen millions a year (£720,000) which were all
that Louis-Philippe himself dared ask for, in the bill which was
presented last year,16 and immediately withdrawn, from the explosion of
public indignation at the magnitude of the demand. Let it be
recollected, that the Civil List in France includes none of the expenses
of the state, unless that of keeping up the Gobelins and Sèvres
manufactories, and a few other items of no great consequence, are so
considered. All the rest goes to the support of the King and royal
family, and the officers of their household, to defraying their private
expenses, and keeping up the domains of Versailles, Fontainebleau, and
about a dozen other old palaces and their appurtenances; to which,
however, forests are attached, sufficient, it is affirmed, even now, and
more than sufficient under proper managements, to pay all the expenses.
Along with all this, we must take into account the private fortune of
Louis-Philippe, which is estimated to yield annually five or six
millions more; exclusive, we presume, of the ill-gotten inheritance of
the poor Duc de Bourbon, now owned by one of Louis-Philippe’s younger
sons,17 but Edition: current; Page: [387] which, if the facts asserted
are made out, the verdict of a court of justice may shortly require back
from his hands.

This remarkable trial, to which we believe we were the first to draw
public notice in this country,18 but which has since been much discussed
in the other papers,19 is still far from being concluded, no more than
one day in every week being dedicated to it. We shall keep our eyes
fixed upon the proceedings, and form the best opinion we can of the
weight of evidence which may be produced on each side.

We must defer till next week some observations which we had intended to
make upon that part of the four days’ debate in the Chamber of Deputies,
which related to the enrollment of a hired rabble in aid of the police
on the 14th of July last.20

 EXAMINER, 8 JAN., 1832, PP. 24-5

“London, January 8, 1832,” is listed as “Article on France” and enclosed
in square brackets in the Somerville College set of the Examiner.

the remainder of M. du Molart’s letters on the revolt of Lyons have
appeared.1 They contain no further information of importance, on the
causes or circumstances of the insurrection; but they charge M. Périer
with asserting a direct falsehood in the Chamber of Deputies. The
particulars of the case are these:—

When the Chamber, shortly after its meeting, had under consideration the
validity of the election of M. Jars, by one of the electoral colleges of
Lyons, it was affirmed that the president of one of the sections of that
college had, during the election, communicated to the electors a
telegraphic dispatch, received from Paris on the 6th of June, to the
following effect: “Paris is perfectly quiet: the elections are declaring
themselves there, as well as in other places, under the most favourable
auspices: considerable majorities are declaring themselves.”2

This proceeding was severely censured, not only by the Opposition, but
by the Edition: current; Page: [388] bureau of the Chamber which had to
report on the validity of the election. It was declared to be an attempt
to influence the votes of the electors, in violation of an express law,
by which the electoral colleges are interdicted from deliberations or
proceedings of any kind whatsoever, except simple voting.3 Hereupon, M.
Périer positively declared that no telegraphic dispatch was sent on the
6th or 7th of June, and that the dispatch in question was not sent till
the 8th, after the elections were over in almost all parts of France.4

Now, this statement M. du Molart asserts to be a falsehood. He affirms
that the story, as it was first told, was strictly true: that the
telegraphic dispatch was couched exactly in the words mentioned; that it
was received on the 6th; that he still possesses the original copy, as
taken down from the telegraph; and that he can establish the fact by the
most perfect evidence.

Whether M. Périer, according to his customary practice, has prosecuted
M. du Molart for defamation, we have not learned. But whichever of the
two parties has falsified the truth (that either can be merely mistaken
is in the nature of the case impossible), the exhibition is a curious
one, and little creditable to the French character. There are a hundred
points on which the tone both of public and private morality is far
higher among the French than among ourselves. It would not seem to be
so, in the important point of personal veracity. England is the classic
land of cant; the hypocritical pretence of feelings and opinions utterly
foreign to the character of the person professing them, is so much a
matter of course in our Parliament, so completely conventional, that
hardly any body is sensible of its baseness. But we solemnly assure our
friends in France, of our firm belief that no man, Whig or Tory, who has
been a Cabinet Minister of England within the present generation, was
ever suspected, by his worst enemies, of deliberately denying, in the
face of the public, any act of his own individually; and that no man who
has held high office within the same period would have been capable of
the falsehood which, if M. Périer is innocent, must be imputed to M. du
Molart: unless indeed, he be an Irishman: for that nation, also superior
to ourselves in some highly valuable qualities, is well understood to
be, in all ranks of society, considerably below the English and Scotch
in adherence to truth.

The recent proceedings in a French court of justice, on the trial of two
editors of newspapers for defamation of M. Casimir Périer and M.
Vivien,5 afforded some very significant circumstances in illustration of
the state of moral feeling in France with respect to personal veracity,
and of several other curious points of national character. The libel, as
it would be stiled in this country, consisted, as is well known, in
charging the authorities with having hired some of the lowest Edition:
current; Page: [389] order of workmen, at three francs a head, to aid
the police in case of the apprehended disturbances on the anniversary of
the destruction of the Bastille. These workmen had acted with
unnecessary violence and brutality against some young men engaged in
planting a tree of liberty; and had never been called to account for
this conduct, while their paid-for services had been celebrated in the
Moniteur as a proof of the excellent spirit which animated the working
population.6 On the trial, it was established that the workmen had been
regularly enrolled, and formed into a kind of organized force, by a man
named Souchet, who kept a tavern in the Faubourg St. Antoine; and that
the belief was general in the Faubourg, that they were to receive three
francs a head. The doubtful question was, whether the police, and the
ministry, or either of them, were parties to the transaction. Souchet
himself was brought forward to swear that they were not; and M. Carlier,
the head of the local police, and M. Bouvatier, mayor of one of the
arrondissements of Paris, both swore positively that they themselves had
no concern in the matter, beyond having merely heard of it.7 But on the
succeeding day, M. Bouvatier spontaneously presented himself before the
Court, and stated that in a moment of irritation, occasioned by a
calumnious imputation made against him by a previous witness, he had
sworn to a falsehood; and that this had caused him so much distress of
mind, that he was anxious to make all the reparation in his power, by
publicly confessing his fault, and declaring the truth. He then gave
evidence implying a much greater degree of participation, or at least
connivance on his part, with respect to the proceedings of Souchet, than
he had admitted in his testimony of the day before. This received
evidence of M. Bouvatier, combined with the obvious prevarication of
Souchet, were what chiefly induced the jury to acquit the accused.

Thus, then, the matter stood, when, in the recent debate of four days on
the policy of the ministers, M. Mauguin revived the subject of the
enlistments, and produced a letter from Souchet.8 In this letter, which
was addressed to the editor of the National (one of the defendants in
the trial),9 Souchet declared, that he also had committed perjury before
the tribunal; that he also, like M. Bouvatier, wished to make reparation
by proclaiming the truth; which when he should have Edition: current;
Page: [390] done, he should, he hoped, be restored to the esteem of
honest men. He then proceeded to declare, that he had enlisted the
workmen at the express instigation of M. Carlier, the head of the
municipal police of Paris, who, as we have already mentioned, had sworn
on the trial, that he had nothing to do with the matter. The principal
agent in the affair, Souchet added, was an employé of the police, by
name Alexandre, who was not produced as a witness, and who, it seems,
has absconded.

M. Périer, in reply, remarked, that no witness had appeared on the
trial, who was able to swear to having actually received money.10 He
affirmed that no money had been furnished by Government; that whatever
might have been Souchet’s proceedings, he alone was responsible for
them, having acted without the cognizance either of the ministry or of
the police; and if he had held out to the workmen any hopes of pecuniary
reward, he must have intended to deceive them, and to make a merit with
Government of his instrumentality in persuading them to volunteer their
services gratuitously. M. Périer accordingly produced a letter from
Souchet, written shortly after the occurrences, soliciting some
recompense of his zeal; and insisted upon what, indeed, was sufficiently
obvious, the little credit due to the assertions of a man who, when all
the world is already convinced that he was perjured, at last confesses
it himself, and presents himself with a second story, in direct
contradiction to his first.

The probability of M. Périer’s participation rests wholly upon the
circumstantial evidence derived from the disappearance of the police
agent Alexandre, and from the fact that no attempt has been made on the
part of Government to clear up the mystery of the transaction, and to
remove from employment any of its officers who may be found to have
participated in it. This evidence is certainly very far from conclusive:
but whatever degree of suspicion it is calculated to engender, M. Périer
has done nothing to dispel it, having offered no explanation of either
of the above circumstances.

The Bill relating to the Peerage11 has passed the second Chamber without
alteration, and is by this time part of the Constitution of France. The
mischievous alteration mentioned in our last paper as having been
proposed by the commission, was almost universally scouted.12 It is
said, that even the Ministers were averse to it, being anxious that the
Bill should not be sent back to the Chamber of Deputies.

The Peers are now engaged in the discussion of a Bill, introduced by the
Ministry into their House, for a reform in that part of the French law
which relates to imprisonment for debt.13 The law, even with the
proposed alteration, Edition: current; Page: [391] has excited surprise
in this country by its extreme harshness; but it is stated that the
tribunals of commerce, which are composed of mercantile men, possess and
exercise the power of confining the operation of its provisions to
debtors who are criminal, and not merely unfortunate.

M. Salverte’s proposition14 for allowing bills which are lost by a
prorogation, to be taken up in the succeeding session at the point at
which their progress had been interrupted, has passed the Chamber of
Deputies, with a slight modification, confining its benefit to bills on
which a commission has reported.

The Commission on the Civil List has at length made its report:15 and
the subject is fixed for immediate discussion. This debate will be
immediately followed by that on the budget; the report on the expenses
(or the estimates, as we should call them) having been received: that on
the receipts (or the ways and means) will shortly follow.16 The subjects
of public education and municipal institutions are therefore postponed
till after the budget—that is to say, to the next session: but in
consequence of the adoption of M. Salverte’s proposition, these bills
will stand for discussion immediately after the meeting of the Chamber.
It is to be hoped that the Commission on the Corn Bill will at least
make its report before the prorogation, that this great subject may also
be disposed of at an early period of the next session.17 We hope,
indeed, for no other good from the report, in the hands to which the
composition of it has been entrusted.

The Commission on the Budget has excited great dissatisfaction among the
popular party, by proposing no greater retrenchment than 10½ millions of
francs, upon estimates amounting to 956,000,000, independent of
140,000,000 of extraordinary expenses, occasioned by defensive military
preparations.

The Commission on the Civil List were equally divided on the amount at
which it should be fixed: four members proposing twelve millions and a
half, and four others fourteen millions.18 The ninth Member of the
Commission, M. de Cormenin, who is for a much smaller amount than
either, stands aloof from both, and is now publishing in the French
papers a most able series of letters on the Civil List.19 It is said
that Louis Philippe, whose ruling passion seems to be avarice, is
greatly offended at the smallness even of the largest sum suggested by
the Commission.

Edition: current; Page: [392]
The lawsuit on the will of the Duke of Bourbon makes but slow
progress.20 The Spectator is severe upon us for having said, that if the
case stated for the plaintiff is made out, Louis Philippe is scarcely
fit to live.21 We ask the Spectator whether this is too much to say of a
man, who is a party to extorting a will in his own favour, from a feeble
old man, through a long series of perpetual annoyance and persecution,
by a woman who, from being the mistress, had become the tyrant of her
protector? Has our contemporary read the letter of the wretched old man
to Louis Philippe himself, beseeching him to use his influence with
Madame de Feuchères to prevail on her to cease importuning him on the
subject; and the canting answer of Louis Philippe to this letter,
containing every thing which a man of common delicacy would not have
written in answer to such a request?22 Even to accept the inheritance,
were there no proof except this letter of the means by which it was
obtained, is an indelible disgrace; though he had been the most
necessitous of mankind, instead of being the monarch of one of the
greatest nations, and possessed besides of one of the greatest private
fortunes, in Europe.

enclosed in square brackets in the Somerville College set of the
Examiner.

the french chamber of deputies continues discussing the Civil List.1 The
amount is not yet decided upon.

In the course of the debate, M. de Montalivet, the Minister of Public
Instruction, employed the expression, “subjects of the King;”2 and a
great number of the Opposition Members took offence at the term,
declaring, that since the Revolution of July, Frenchmen were not the
subjects, but the fellow-citizens, of their chief magistrate. The
sensitiveness evinced on the subject of a word has excited much surprise
and a little contempt on this side of the channel; and it must be
allowed to have been excessive, when contrasted with the much less
violent feelings which would have been displayed on subjects of Edition:
current; Page: [393] much greater importance. But we consider the
incapacity which has been evinced in this country, to understand and
sympathise in such feelings, a far worse symptom of national character
than a little excess in the feelings themselves. Let us not lay the
pleasing unction to our souls,3 that it is a proof of our superior
wisdom and manliness. It arises simply from this, that in France, words
really mean things; while our political vocabulary is a mere
conventional jargon. We have reached that last stage of political
hypocrisy, in which we are even unconscious of using the language of
deception; because nobody ever dreams that we intend the obvious meaning
of our words. The courtesies of politics, with us, have gradually
attained the pure no-meaning of the courtesies of private life among the
Orientals; who, if they were really ready to sacrifice their lives for
you, would have no words in which to tell you so, every phrase they
could have used for that purpose having dwindled down into a mere form
of politeness. With them, as with us, it cannot be said that the person
who uses the lying language shows himself personally indifferent to
truth, for custom causes the words to be taken in a purely complimentary
sense. But the very fact that the words have thus altered their meaning,
is a far greater proof of long habits of hypocrisy than any other which
could be produced, since it is evidence against the whole nation.

All our institutions are based upon falsehoods. English law is one mass
of fiction. The law of real property is entirely founded upon pretended
feudal rights in the King and his vassals,—rights which once existed,
but have long ceased to exist. The whole practice of our courts of
justice is made up of fiction. Every summons to appear before a court of
law pretends that the King is personally present to try the cause. A
common subpoena to attend as a witness, is an order to appear before the
King, in company with a fictitious personage, named John Doe. You cannot
bring an action in one of the courts without pretending to be a debtor
of the King, nor in another without saying that you are in the
Marshalsea prison, nor in either without telling the most ridiculous
falsehoods about the nature of your claim. It is not wonderful, where
falsehoods without an object are in the common course of things, that
falsehoods of servility should be universal: that the King’s exemption
from legal responsibility should be dressed up into that notable piece
of sycophancy, “the King can do no wrong;”4 that Ministers of the Crown
should call the King their master, and themselves his servants, that he
should be stiled in all legal documents, “our Lord the King;” and, to
crown all, that expressions like these,—expressions identical with those
used towards God Almighty,—should be uttered of the chief magistrate of
the State, by highminded men, without any intention of hypocrisy or
sense of degradation.

Edition: current; Page: [394]
Words have never been deemed a matter of indifference in politics, where
anything like a healthful tone of political morality has prevailed. They
were not deemed a matter of indifference in Greece or Rome, nor are they
deemed so in the United States of America, nor in France. But they were
so deemed at the Court of Darius, and at the Court of Louis XIV.5 They
are so deemed in China, and in Hindostan, and in England. How should it
be otherwise? When words are thought of no consequence, it is because
feelings are thought of no consequence. It is words which bind together
and call forth feelings. All but philosophers are mainly governed by the
associations connected with words. Why did Julius Caesar wish to be a
King, when he already seemed to have all the power of one?6 Because no
one can have all the power, who has not the name. Why was the name of
King necessary to France, after the three days of July? Because no other
name would have had command over those associations, by which, far more
than either by interest or duty, mankind are kept in obedience to
established governments. Words are the grand instruments of educating
the imagination; and all the affections except those of our daily life.
And from this and other causes running parallel with it, arises the fact
so often observed, that there exists no more certain symptom of national
corruption than the corruption of the language. With the fall of Grecian
liberty commenced the decline of the Greek language; the corruption of
Latinity might be measured by the succession of the Roman Emperors: and
our own language has advanced as much in effeminacy since the days of
Milton and Harrington, and Bishop Taylor and Hobbes,7 as the French
language has grown in masculine vigour since the death of Louis XV.8 For
it is the national literature and the national character which first
shape the language, and are afterwards reacted upon by the character
which they have impressed upon it.

Of the immense advantages which France owes to her revolutions, it is
not one of the least, that the language of her constitution is the
expression of the real principles of her constitution. The words were
framed to express things as they really exist; and being still new, they
have not lost their original freshness of meaning. It is accordingly as
much expected that a man shall mean what he says, in public as in
private life. The language used by respectable men at the tribune, or
through the press, is expected to be the expression of their real
feelings; and there would be as much disgrace in substituting words of
mere ceremony, as Edition: current; Page: [395] there is in practising
hypocrisy towards an individual. When this shall be the case in England,
Englishmen will be able to understand why the Opposition in the Chamber
of Deputies, could not bear to be called the subjects of their
shopkeeper-king. Till then, we shall probably continue to laugh at their
folly, and to compliment ourselves on our good sense, upon the strength
of our moral callousness.

The Morning Chronicle has had an able article on this subject, which was
cleverly followed up in the same paper by an anonymous correspondent.9

There has been a conspiracy at Paris. An insurrectionary proclamation
has been discovered: the conspirators were to sound the great bell of
Notre Dame, and to set fire to a tower, by way of signal. Unhappily,
however, the Times had awkwardly early information of the discovery. M.
Périer had arranged that the conspiracy should break out on Monday, and
informed the correspondent of the Times accordingly, but afterwards put
off the discovery for two days longer, forgetting to give due notice to
the said correspondent: who consequently wrote word to the Times on
Tuesday, of what did not take place till Wednesday.10 This was a sad
blunder of M. Périer. A conspiracy so miserably bungled can be of little
use to any Government. It was well enough to have a plot, but it should
not have been seen to be got up by the Ministers themselves.

the civil list of louis philippe is at length finally voted by the
Chamber of Deputies. It amounts to twelve millions of francs
(480,000l.)1 It is therefore a trifle less than the Civil List of our
own King; who, however, has not a private fortune, amounting to about
half as much more; who, unlike Louis Philippe, thinks himself bound to
pay to the richest noblemen of the land, salaries worth the acceptance
of such persons, for consenting to be officers of his household; and who
never said any thing about surrounding his throne with republican
institutions,2 nor ever claimed or affected to call himself a Citizen
King.

Edition: current; Page: [396]
Even this large sum, however, is no more than two-thirds of that which
was originally proposed, and which Louis Philippe has received
provisionally up to this time. The Chamber has decided that he shall not
be called upon to refund, although the disbursement was made without any
legal authority.

Several young men, members of the Société des Amis du Peuple, have been
tried for circulating some republican pamphlets. On the trial they
avowed, and even ostentatiously proclaimed, their political opinions;
for which conduct, although they were acquitted by the jury, the judge
took upon himself to pass sentences of six, twelve, and fifteen months
imprisonment on several of their number.3 The Times is as abusive on the
occasion, as every one who knows the habits and character of that
journal would naturally expect.4 Its indignation against the principles
professed by these “fellows,” as it calls them, in that elegant and
polished style of vituperation for which it is celebrated, renders it
utterly blind to the flagrant injustice of which they are the victims.
These young men were not conspirators; they were not put on their trial
for conspiracy, but simply for publishing opinions in disapprobation of
the existing form of government. When the jury have declared by their
verdict, that men ought not to be punished for publishing republican
opinions, is the judge to set aside the verdict of the jury, and condemn
the prisoners, on his own authority, to sentences even more severe than
would have been the consequences of conviction, on the pretext that they
have adopted an improper course of defence?—The defence of some of them
was intemperate and silly; probably the original publications were so:
but a prisoner on his trial is, by the laws of all countries, privileged
to enjoy a great latitude, both in the topics he brings forward, and in
the language he employs. And we solemnly affirm, that if some of those
who have been thus nefariously treated, afforded some colour at least
for Edition: current; Page: [397] such treatment, others, if the report
we have read is correct,5 were absolutely innocent of using a single
expression which ought to have subjected them even to a reprimand.


138.: THE IRISH CHARACTER
 EXAMINER, 22 JAN., 1832, P. 56

This unheaded leading article, an early indication of the interest in
national character that led to Mill’s unfulfilled wish to write an
“Ethology,” is described in his bibliography as “An article on the Irish
character in reply to a correspondent signing himself ‘Erinensis,’
subjoined to the summary of French news [i.e., No. 137], in the Examiner
of 22d January 1832” (MacMinn, p. 19). It is listed as “Article on the
Irish character, in reply to a correspondent” and enclosed in square
brackets in the Somerville College set of the Examiner. The letter by
Erinensis, which was not published in the Examiner, has not been
located.

we have received a letter, signed Erinensis, accusing us of having
“taken advantage of the Périer and Cormenin controversy to fling a
deliberate and wanton insult on the Irish character,” and calling upon
us to state “from what sources of authority” we have derived our ideas
of the Irish character, “or what the relative veracity of our respective
countries had to do with the squabbles of Messrs. Périer and Cormenin.”1
As we should be much grieved to be thought capable of going out of our
way to say what might hurt the feelings of any one, we shall answer the
second question first. We were laying claim, in behalf of our
countrymen, to a superiority in private veracity over the French. Now,
as the Irish, though they do not consider themselves our countrymen, are
considered such by foreigners, we thought it right, in order not to make
a false impression, to state that we meant the assertion only of the
English and Scotch.

As for our “sources of authority” in regard to the Irish character, we
have none that are peculiar to ourselves: our evidence is public
notoriety. To go no further, we have reason to believe that most
tradesmen of respectability will inform—not our fiery correspondent—but
any cooler person, or himself in a cooler mood, that they will give
credit to an Englishman or a Scotchman, but not to an Irishman.

Having now answered our correspondent’s two questions, we hope he will
not Edition: current; Page: [398] think ill of us for saying, that, as
we never hesitate to denounce the national faults and vices of our own
country, often at a great sacrifice of our interest as journalists, we
think it but fair that we should use as little reserve in speaking of
other nations and races of men. We can assure our correspondent that the
feeling with which we wrote was any thing but one of reproach or of
triumph. We are but too grievously sensible of the load of guilt which
lies upon the conscience of England for the vices of Irishmen. Would
misgovernment be the crying and dreadful evil that it is, if ages of it
were not sufficient to leave any visible stain upon the national
character? The only wonder is, that any virtue should survive, in a
society the most wretchedly constituted which has existed in Europe
since the commencement of modern civilisation. We believe from our
hearts that the virtue of Englishmen would, in a few generations, have
become utterly extinct under such treatment. What has preserved Ireland
from the lowest stage of moral debasement, has been that susceptibility
of ardent and generous emotion, which is common to her people with the
French, and in which the inhabitants of our own island are, in
comparison with either, most conspicuously deficient. But this noble
quality, the fountain of so many virtues, is the characteristic
excellence of an impressible people—a people all alive to the sensation
of the moment, little addicted to calm reflection, and on whom distant
motives have comparatively little influence. The virtues of spontaneous
growth among such a people, can never be the virtues of self-control: if
these are found in such a soil, they must be the fruit of sedulous moral
culture. Such a people will be generous, brave, hospitable, keenly alive
both to kindness and to unkindness, ardent in their private attachments,
in their humanity, in their patriotism. But it requires highly
favourable circumstances to render them equally remarkable for the
virtues which consist in curbing impulse, and resisting temptation:
stern integrity, justice, forethought, self-denial, veracity. In many of
the positive virtues, the Irish are probably, the French certainly, our
superiors. In many of the negative ones, both, we fear, have much to
learn even from so imperfect an example as ours.


139.: EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN IN MANUFACTORIES
 EXAMINER, 29 JAN., 1832, PP. 67-8

This leader, headed as title, is in the “Political Examiner.” See the
further correspondence in No. 146. The article is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “An article headed ‘Employment of children in
Manufactories’ in the Examiner of 29th Jan. 1832” (MacMinn, p. 19), and
listed as title and enclosed in square brackets in the Somerville
College set of the Examiner, where there is one correction: at 399.20,
“this gradually; and” is changed to “this. Gradually, and”.

Edition: current; Page: [399]
we have received a most able and interesting paper, emanating from a
committee of operative flax-spinners at Dundee, and entituled “Reasons
for a Legislative measure (similar to that lately proposed by Sir J.C.
Hobhouse) to limit and regulate the hours during which young persons may
be employed to labour in flax-spinning mills throughout Scotland.”1 The
force of argument, and dignified calmness of manner, displayed in this
document, to which the ablest periodical works of the day could not
produce on this important subject any thing superior, entitle it to be
read and pondered over by every one who takes interest either in the
physical well being of the manufacturing population, or in the symptoms
and results of that remarkable intelligence which, under so many
unfavourable circumstances, has so generally diffused itself among them.

The moral and physical evils occasioned by the over-working of male and
female children in manufactories are powerfully depicted in this paper;
all the arguments against legislative interference, which self-interest
or the spirit of routine has suggested, are refuted with much
dialectical skill, and an enquiry before a parliamentary committee is
prayed for to substantiate all the facts stated. For our own part, we
should most strenuously applaud, not merely the measure proposed, of
restricting the employment of children in manufactories to a certain
number of hours out of the twenty-four, but even a far wider measure
than this. Gradually, and, with due consideration of existing interests
and expectations, we should wish to see a law established, interdicting
altogether the employment of children under fourteen, and females of any
age, in manufactories.

No one can hesitate to acknowledge how desirable it is that such
employment should cease. No well-wisher to his species can desire that
children, up to the age of fourteen, should be employed otherwise than
in fitting their bodies by exercise and freedom, and their minds by
education, and that best of all moral training, that of the parental
fireside, for the duties which they have to discharge in life. As little
can it be desired that the mother of children should be employed in any
gainful occupation which withdraws her from the midst of her family.
Another thing is equally obvious.

The Dundee operatives profess themselves willing to submit to the
diminution of earnings, which would be the effect of the measure they
propose; but the truth is, that neither that, nor the more extensive
measure which we advocate, would produce any diminution of earnings. It
would withdraw a certain number of competitors from the labour market;
and the wages of the remainder would immediately rise to the same
aggregate amount. The diminished production Edition: current; Page:
[400] would be a diminution solely of the capitalist’s profits; which
would no doubt be reduced by this, in the same manner as by any other
rise of wages. Such diminution is desirable; since it is of greater
importance that the labourer should have wages sufficient for his
comfort, than that his employer should receive £2000 a year instead of
£1000. If the manufacturer requires compensation, let it be given by a
repeal of the corn laws, and a commutation of all taxes falling upon the
necessaries of life, or the materials of manufacture.

The objections which are to be anticipated from well-meaning and
enlightened men, are not to the desirableness of the end in view, but to
the propriety of attempting to effect it by legislative enactment. They
consist of arguments drawn from the non-interference philosophy, and
resting on the maxim, that government ought not to prohibit individuals,
not under the influence of force or fraud, from binding themselves by
any engagement which they may think fit to contract, provided it do not
violate the legal rights of a third party.

Of this principle we are ourselves partisans up to a certain point; but
it appears to us that there is a large class of cases, to which the
reason of the principle does not apply, and to which, therefore, the
principle itself cannot properly be applicable. The reason of the
principle is, that an individual may be presumed a better judge of his
own interest than the government, at least as governments are now
constituted. But is it not very possible that cases may exist, in which
it would be highly for the advantage of every body, if every body were
to act in a certain manner, but in which it is not the interest of any
individual to adopt the rule for the guidance of his own conduct, unless
he has some security that all others will do so too? There are a
thousand such cases: and when they arise, who is to afford the security
that is wanting, except the legislature?

The case now under consideration is a case of this description. It would
be highly for the advantage of the labouring classes, to agree never to
allow their wives or young children to receive employment in
manufactories. If this agreement were made and executed, wages would
rise, so that the man alone would be able to earn all that is now earned
by the entire family. But as soon as this was the case, it would become
the private interest of individuals to break through the rule. Any man
whose wife and children work while others abstain, gets the advantage of
the high wages, both for his own labour and for theirs. All needy and
selfish persons would take advantage of this; wages would gradually
relapse to their present low rate; and then, it would be necessary for
all to revert to present practice, in order to live.

This is therefore precisely the kind of case in which the government
ought to interfere. It is a case in which the private immediate interest
of each individual is necessarily in opposition to the general interest,
unless a universal compact among all individuals is made and enforced.
But the only power which can promulgate and guarantee a compact among
all the labouring people of the community, is the government; and the
only mode in which it can do so is by a Edition: current; Page: [401]
law. If it is beyond the competency of government to do this, it is
beyond their competency to do any thing. No objection would apply to
their right to make this law, which would not prove that they had no
right to prohibit stealing. Even if there were no government, it would
be for the general interest of the community that nobody should steal.
Why not leave it then to individual interest? Because, although nobody
would benefit if all mankind were to steal, yet if some abstain
voluntarily, that very abstinence enables others to benefit themselves
by stealing. It is necessary therefore that the compact made among the
community generally, should be enforced by penal sanctions against any
individual who, while he reaps the benefit of its observance by others,
does not himself conform to it.


140.: FRENCH NEWS [45]
 EXAMINER, 29 JAN., 1832, PP. 72-3

Since this article contains a lengthy defence of the Saint Simonians,
Mill sent a copy of it to Michel Chevalier (see n7) through his friend
Gustave d’Eichthal (EL, CW, Vol. XII, p. 96). For the entry in Mill’s
bibliography, see No. 116. The article, headed “London, January 29,
1832,” is listed as “Article on France” and enclosed in square brackets
in the Somerville College set of the Examiner, with two inked
corrections: at 402.18, “been as long” is altered to “been long” and at
403.23 “instituting” is altered to “substituting”.

the french chamber of deputies has been occupied during all this week in
the discussion of the budget.1 The opposition universally demands far
greater retrenchments than those purposed by the commission. Of the
manner in which this demand is met, the reader may judge, from the
expressions of a young ministerial deputy and placeman, M. de Rémusat,
who said, “It is time to renounce the chimera or the charlatanism of
retrenchments. The taxes are the best possible investment of the
people’s money:”2 and this, in fact, seems to be a general opinion among
the supporters of the ministry, particularly those who are receivers of
taxes,—they all think that the greatest service a Government can do to a
country is to tax it highly, because the revenue is all spent in the
country. It naturally never occurs to these gentlemen, that it would
also be spent in the country, if it were left in the pockets of the
payers.

On the other hand, we cannot help blaming many members of the
Opposition, for the vehement rhetoric with which they insist on the
distresses of the working classes, as a motive for lowering the taxes.
Those distresses are not such as could be sensibly alleviated, even by
the greatest reduction of taxes, which any one has Edition: current;
Page: [402] proposed. They are not caused by the amount of the budgets,
but by their present want of employment, and the means of remedying
this, are, first, whatever conduces to the restoration of mercantile
confidence, and general security: next, whatever by increasing the
return to the national capital, extends the range of employment, such
as—beneficial public works, and the removal of restrictions on trade or
production, and lastly, improvements (and in no country are they more
required) in the mode of levying the revenue: which is at present
derived, in a very great proportion, from taxes pressing with
disproportionate severity upon the very poorest classes. It is chiefly
to these three purposes, that an enlightened member of the French
Legislature would direct such of his exertions, as are intended for the
relief of the immediate sufferings of the labouring classes, and we are
happy to say, that there are, even now, many deputies whose exertions
are thus directed.

It is remarkable, how far the French public is behind ours on some
questions of finance. The absurdity of continuing the payments to the
Sinking Fund,3 while actually borrowing money; of borrowing with one
hand merely to pay off debt with the other, losing the commission, and
the expenses of management;—this flagrant absurdity, which has been long
seen through and given up, even by the most ignorant of our hacks in
office, is gravely defended at this time of day, not only by the French
ministry and the commission of the French Chamber, but even by such men
as M. Laffitte; who, undoubtedly, among French financiers, must be
deemed a highly instructed man.4

The war against the press continues; The Tribune is now under
prosecution, for the thirty-third time since July 1830. The government
prosecutions of the press under Louis Philippe have already exceeded in
number all those of Louis XVIII and Charles X in the sixteen years of
the Restoration. Although in nine cases out of ten the prisoners are
acquitted, the vindictive severity of the sentence in the tenth case
pays for the whole. M. Allier, an advocate, member of the Society of the
Friends of the People, having recently been convicted, for what, if the
whole resembles the passages we have seen, appears to us a perfectly
innocent publication of political opinions, has been sentenced to a fine
and two years imprisonment.5 Three successive editors of the Tribune are
now in prison, and have little prospect of ever more being out of it.6
Can any one affect to Edition: current; Page: [403] wonder that men, who
are thus treated, without being conscious of any guilt, should write in
a tone of exasperation? It is impossible that a government which needs
to support itself by such odious means, can have much longer to exist.

Not content with prosecuting the republicans for publishing their
speculative opinions, M. Périer has now instituted a prosecution of a
similar kind against the chiefs of the St. Simonians.7 The republicans
have often been intemperate in addressing the public, and have shown
that they would at least not be sorry if the consequence of their
writings were an insurrection; but the St. Simonians are as mild and
pacific in their opinions and in their language as the Quakers
themselves, and have studiously impressed upon the minds of the working
people, in every way in which they could gain access to them, that
nothing can, in the present age, be so prejudicial to their chances of
improving their condition as violence in any shape.

We anticipate nothing from this most contemptible attempt at putting
down opinion by the law, except a still more rapid growth of this
religious and political sect: who, whatever may be thought of their
system as a whole, (and from some parts of it few can dissent more
strongly than ourselves) are yet, in our opinion, eminently right in
many other of their views, whose leaders are among the ablest and most
highly instructed men in France; whose writings and preachings are
distinguished for literary talent, and can be read by few, who are
capable of thinking, without advantage—who, in the course of a year,
have entirely changed the character of political discussion, in the
provincial, and, in some measure, even the Paris papers, by substituting
important ideas of practical improvement for mere phrases and
abstractions; and whose extraordinary success, up to the present time,
we ascribe wholly to their real superiority over all other parties,
sects, or classes of thinkers and writers in France. We have little
expectation that the St. Simonian society will hold together for many
years, nor are we by any means convinced that it is desirable it should.
But we are satisfied that its rise and progress is an important event in
history; at once an evidence, and a cause, of an entirely new tone of
thinking and feeling in France, as well among philosophers and
publicists, as in the nation at large.

141.: HICKSON’S THE NEW CHARTER
 EXAMINER, 5 FEB., 1832, P. 84

This review, another of Mill’s infrequent newspaper comments on the
current battle for British reform, indicates his early acquaintance with
William Hickson (1803-70), philanthropist and educational reformer, with
whom he was later intimately involved in journalism and municipal
reform. The review, in the “Literary Examiner,” is headed “The New
Charter. Humbly addressed to the King and both Houses of Parliament.
Proposed as the basis of a Constitution for the Government of Great
Britain and Ireland; and as a substitute for the Reform Bill rejected by
the Lords. [London:] Strange, Paternoster-row. 1831. pp. 16.” It is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “A review of a pamphlet entitled
‘The New Charter’ (by William Hickson), in the Examiner of 5th February
1832” (MacMinn, p. 19), and is listed as “Review of ‘The New Charter,’ a
pamphlet by William Hickson” and enclosed in square brackets in the
Somerville College set of the Examiner.

this little tract, the production of one who enjoys great and deserved
influence among the middle classes of London, to whom he himself
belongs, is well-deserving of attention from all who wish to know what
is passing in the minds of the most intelligent leaders of the people.
It displays considerable reflection, and some reach of thought. The
writer has a mind sufficiently enlarged to feel the value of principles
in politics, without falling into the common error of those who, having
a little cleverness and a large stock of self-conceit, imagine that some
one principle, which they have caught a glimpse of, contains all
political science within itself.

After a brief introduction, the author enumerates the leading maxims on
which, in his opinion, governments should be founded. We think we can
perceive a tendency in the writer, which we regret, to a belief that his
principles are of universal application; that the science of politics is
fixed and unchangeable, like a system of abstract truth, instead of
being, as we consider it, progressive with civilization, and fluctuating
with the exigencies of society. But to most of his maxims, as applied to
the present state of Great Britain and Ireland, we have little to
object. Some of them, when stated in a general way, have the air of
barren truisms; but even these, when interpreted according to the
explanations and remarks which accompany them like a running commentary,
will occasionally, we might say invariably, be found to rise into
unexpected significance and importance.

Among the principles enumerated, will be observed, along with some which
are familiar texts of the democratic reformers, several which have
probably been the result of the author’s individual meditations, there
being few accessible sources whence he can have derived them. His most
valuable idea, in our estimation, is that of the importance of local
representative bodies for the management of local affairs: his greatest
error, the opinion that, by the aid of Edition: current; Page: [405]
such local arrangements, portions of the human race so heterogeneous as
the people of England and those of India, for instance, or our Slave
Colonies, can possibly be united under a uniform representative
government. His plan, too, of a ladder of elections, mounting by
successive stages from the village to the empire—A electing B, who
elects C, who elects D—is a part of his system which we strongly urge
him to reconsider.

m. de cormenin has published a letter1 to M. Casimir Périer, which is
the hardest blow the Minister has ever yet received. With this
exception, scarcely any thing of importance has occurred in France
during the last week. The discussion of the Budget continues. The
Chamber has decided, by a small majority, that it will persevere in the
detected juggle of paying off debt by borrowing; the preposterous and
self-contradictory job of giving large profits to contractors and
stockbrokers for allowing the French Government the use of its own
money.

Several good speeches have been delivered in the Chamber on this
question. Those of MM. Pagès, Jollivet, de Tracy, and Mauguin, have
excited our particular attention.2 Yet there are several points on which
even they have curiously missed the mark.

It was contended, for example, by the advocates of a Sinking Fund, that
its operations tend to keep up the price of public securities, and
thereby enable the State, when it stands in need of loans, to obtain
them on easier terms. Now, the answer to this, though extremely obvious,
was not given.

There is no doubt that the purchases of stock made in redemption of the
debt have some slight effect in keeping up the price of the funds, when
the redemption is bonâ fide, from a real surplus revenue—that is, when
the State has not occasion to borrow. But when there is no surplus
revenue, but, on the contrary, a deficit,—when the State must borrow to
defray even the expenses of Edition: current; Page: [406] Government, it
is surely obvious, that if it then employs any of its own money in
redeeming old debt, it must borrow so much the more: if it redeems ten
millions of old stock, it must, in consequence, create an additional ten
millions of new, which it would not otherwise have had occasion for. If,
therefore, the one operation tends to raise the funds, the other must
have an equal tendency to depress them.

It has even a greater tendency. For, the contractor of the new loan must
have his profits—seldom so little as four or five per cent. More,
therefore, than ten millions of new debt must be contracted, in order to
redeem ten millions of old. More new stock must be created and thrown
into the market than is numerically equivalent to the stock redeemed.
The funds, therefore, instead of being raised, are actually lowered, by
keeping up the operations of the Sinking Fund while the country is
obliged to borrow. And this piece of hocus-pocus, instead of rendering
the terms of the new loan more favourable, renders them actually more
unfavourable.

We can believe, indeed, that before the subject was understood, the
Sinking Fund might, even under the circumstances we have described, have
had some influence in keeping up the price of stocks; not by its effect
on the real pecuniary interests of the buyers and sellers,—for that, as
has just been shown, is all the other way; but by what, in France, is
called a moral influence: an influence of mere feeling. During the
currency of the notions which were prevalent at the commencement of Mr.
Pitt’s system,3 respecting the magical virtues of compound interest—when
the Sinking Fund was regarded as a mine of wealth, as something which
(to use the expression of Lord Henry Petty, now Marquis of Lansdowne)
creates something out of nothing;4—the vague feeling of confidence
generated by this strange delusion, had a tendency, no doubt, to keep up
the value of the funds, as of all other securities, public and private.
In like manner we have no doubt that the funds would rise, if the public
could be induced to believe that at ten o’clock every morning, beginning
with to-morrow, food for twenty millions of people would be rained down
from Heaven. But an increase of commercial confidence, arising from such
a source, is not to be sought or desired: for the reasons which have led
mankind, in all ages, to agree that delusion is an evil, and that it is
a virtue to tell the truth.

another conspiracy has broken out at Paris: whether of the same kind
with that of which the “leading journal of Europe” had such timely
information,1 it is impossible for us as yet to judge. Some hundreds of
persons have been arrested, one of whom, a M. Poncelet, (a shoemaker),
fired a pistol and wounded the sergent de ville who apprehended him. The
conspirators are said to be a mixture of Carlists and Republicans: we
shall see.2 If the plot was real, and Republicans had any concern in it,
they have profited little by the advice given them by their leader, M.
Cavaignac, in his defence, on a charge of conspiracy, about a year ago,
when the prosecutors made so miserable a figure.3 But as far as we are
yet able to judge, the imputation, so far as it affects Republicans, is
sheer calumny.

All persons of any consideration in France, have long outgrown the
juvenile folly of conspiracies. Experience to them has not been without
its fruits. Eight or ten years ago, when anything like a popular
government in France appeared hopeless; when M. de Villèle was lord of
the ascendant, his famous chambre des trois cents in full glory, and
events seemed to be rapidly retrograding towards jesuitry, superstition,
and feudal privileges; such errors were pardonable: and at that time
many persons of real virtue and ability were deeply involved in secret
societies and Carbonaro intrigues. But they soon found that it is not
possible to carry a great nation by a coup de main; and that nothing, in
the present state of the world, is so idle or so insane, as a
conspiracy; inasmuch as it cannot succeed, unless the public mind goes
with it; and if this be the case, it is not needed. The only conspiracy
which is not absurd, is a conspiracy of the public itself, in the face
of day. Accordingly, though the government had never been able to get
possession of more than a few detached threads of the great and
well-knit web of French carbonarism, the combination speedily dissolved
itself; and the men of talents and ardour who had taken the lead in it,
found other and better means of doing their part towards improving the
institutions of their country.

But if all men of tolerable judgment had found out, long before the
revolution Edition: current; Page: [408] of July, that a conspiracy is a
blunder, and therefore a crime; none but the most senseless of human
beings can remain blind to the same conviction, after the memorable
lesson of the three days—when that which so many had risked their lives
in vainly striving to effect prematurely, came to pass as it were in a
moment, almost without difficulty or resistance, when the hour had come,
and the silent march of events had prepared the nation to see the
overthrow of their government, some with joyful acclamation, the
remainder with silent acquiescence.

The few, for there are but few, raw and hot-headed young men, who look
with favour upon schemes for subverting the present French government by
force, have yet to learn, that any attempt on the part of a minority, to
impose upon a nation institutions not called for by a majority of those
who habitually take part in public affairs, is a crime: still more so
when the majority are not simply indifferent, but positively hostile:
and that such an attempt, if it could be successful, is almost the only
event which could now seriously retard the progress of political reform.
It is the merest illusion to suppose that a government, established
agaisnt the will of an active majority, whatever may be its name or
forms, can be a free government. The Long Parliament, in our own
country, made so miserable an end of its career simply from this one
fault:4 and all the horrors of the Reign of Terror were the fruits of a
mistake of the self-same nature in France.5 The men of our Commonwealth
had, to a certain extent, a valid excuse in the force of circumstances,
which rendered it extremely difficult for them to act otherwise than
they did; and the same plea has been urged, though with far inferior
force, in behalf of the more well-meaning among the abettors of the
revolutionary government of 1793. But a similar miscalculation in a
Frenchman of 1832 would be utterly without excuse. And every person in
France of the slightest pretensions to sense or talents, to whom such
designs have been specifically imputed, has been able, as might be
expected, triumphantly to exculpate himself. The exertions of all such
persons, whether in the Chamber or out of doors, are directed, so far as
respects politics, to one only end, that of influencing the public mind.
And this they will continue to do, in spite of the Citizen King, and his
Attornies-General, who will not for a single moment let them alone.

The government of Louis Philippe regards, or pretends to regard, its own
existence and that of a free press as incompatible. There needs not the
gift of prophecy to predict, if this be the case, which of the two will
be the survivor. The Edition: current; Page: [409] press, in France, has
hitherto been more than a match for every government which has defied it
to a contest.

Even the Times has, at length, pronounced its condemnation of these
relentless persecutions of the Press.6 But it could not do so without
hazarding the gratuitous and unfounded assertion, that all the
journalists prosecuted would have been found guilty of seditious libel
by an English jury. The case is so notoriously the reverse, that many of
the pretended libels have been such as no English Attorney-General would
have dared to bring before any jury. Is the Times aware that the juries,
who, in nine cases out of ten, have dismissed the prosecutions, are much
more select than even what are called in England special juries; being
composed exclusively of electors paying 200 francs of direct taxes, and
the members of a few liberal professions? Nine times out of ten, the
convictions and feelings of these juries must have been unfavourable to
the doctrines, for the promulgation of which the accused were put upon
their trial. Principle, and not any fellow-feeling with the defendants,
must have been the sole motive of the acquittals. Most fortunate was it
that the law establishing Trial by Jury in political cases, passed the
Chambers in the first temporary enthusiasm after the revolution of
July.7 Had it been delayed till now, we may see, clearly enough, that it
never would have been obtained while the present French government
lasts.

The Chamber of Peers has thrown out M. Salverte’s proposition for
allowing the unfinished business of one session to be taken up in statu
quo in the next.8 The reason given by M. Roy against adopting this
highly proper and useful measure, was, that if it were acceded to, the
Committees on the bills pending at the time of the prorogation, might
imagine that they had a right to convoke the Chambers, in violation of
the royal prerogative!9 This, it will be allowed, is a notable specimen
of a non-hereditary Peerage.

The Chamber of Deputies, after a long debate,10 has appointed a
commission of its own body, to inquire into the deficiency in the public
treasury, occasioned by the embezzlements and flight of the head
cashier, M. Kesner;11 and to report through what defect in the manner of
keeping the public accounts, this officer, and his predecessors before
him, have been enabled to become defaulters to so Edition: current;
Page: [410] great an amount. The monies abstracted from the Treasury by
M. Kesner’s peculations, amounts to nearly six millions of francs;
£240,000.

The Commission of the Budget has made its remaining report, that on the
ways and means.12 In the present state of the finances of France, an
increase of taxes was more to be expected than a relief from them: some
change was however looked for in the mode of laying them on; which is
even worse in France than it is among ourselves. This hope, however,
finds little to encourage it in the report of the commission. The
individual selected as the reporter, was M. Humann, the oracle of the
non-improvement school; a man in whose estimation the existing system of
finance, taxation, and commercial policy in France, is a pattern of
perfection. Accordingly all the taxes which had been most justly
complained of, as pressing with disproportionate severity on the poorest
classes, are mercilessly adhered to; in particular, the salt-tax, and
the tax on fermented liquors: imposts, which, independently of all other
objections, are so vexatious in the mode of collection, that they, more
than any other cause, have rendered every successive French government
unpopular with the labouring people. It is proposed gradually to
suppress the lottery; gradually enough, in all conscience,—the period
fixed for its termination being 1836. The only real improvement
recommended is the correction of an error committed last year,—that of
increasing the impôt personnel, a kind of modified poll-tax, and the tax
on doors and windows, and exacting them more rigorously from the poorer
class of contributors.

The new taxes proposed are, an increased duty on cotton wool, and on
sugar, whether imported from the colonies or manufactured from beet-root
in France. There is also to be an additional tax on legacies and
inheritances, beyond the fourth degree of consanguinity. There is
something to be said in favour of a tax of this last description. Mr.
Bentham, long ago, and others since his time, have proposed that the
property of intestates should never pass to collateral relations at all,
but, on failure of the descending and ascending line, should escheat to
the State.13 This, however, though highly proper as a prospective
measure, should not operate to the prejudice of existing interests and
expectations: otherwise it is the height of injustice; and a peculiar
tax on this class of inheritances is an injustice of the same kind, only
less in degree.

It is melancholy to see, that an event so pregnant with meaning as the
late insurrection of Lyons, should have made no deeper impression upon
the men by whom France is now governed, than is indicated by all they
do, and by all they Edition: current; Page: [411] fail to do, day after
day, and month after month. Yet they have not been without better
advisers. Not to mention any others, an excellent pamphlet by M.
Decourdemanche, a Paris advocate, intituled, Lettres sur la Législation
dans ses Rapports avec l’Industrie et la Propriété, and an able article
in the Revue Encyclopédique, on the Budget of 1832, by M. Emile
Péreire,14 contain, along with some errors, much valuable information
and many profound views, which, if received with the attention they well
deserve, would have placed the Government of the Citizen King in a very
different position before the French people and the world, from that in
which they now unhappily stand.


144.: TODD’S BOOK OF ANALYSIS
 EXAMINER, 19 FEB., 1832, PP. 115-17

This article, reviewing the work of Tweedy John Todd (1789-1840),
physician and medical writer, witnesses to Mill’s concurrent work on
logic. The first item in the “Literary Examiner,” it is headed “The Book
of Analysis, or, a New Method of Experience; whereby the Induction of
the Novum Organon is made easy of application to Medicine, Physiology,
Meteorology, and Natural History; to Statistics, Political Economy,
Metaphysics, and the more complex departments of Knowledge. By Tweedy
John Todd, M.D. Royal College of Physicians of London, &c. &c. [London:]
Murray, 1831.” It is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A review of a
work entitled ‘The Book of Analysis, or a New Method of Experience’ by
Tweedy John Todd, Esq. M.D.—In the Examiner of 19th February 1832.”
(MacMinn, p. 19.) It is listed as “Review of ‘The Book of Analysis, by
T.J. Todd, M.D.’ ” and enclosed in square brackets in the Somerville
College set of the Examiner.

this is not a quackish book, though it is a book with rather a quackish
title. When we first read the solemn announcement of “a new method of
experience,” we expected to find a scheme for superseding the five
senses: but it is not so: the author proposes no method of experience,
other than the good old mode of seeing, hearing, and feeling. What he
has invented is a method, not of experience, but of recording and
marshalling our experience, in order to show more clearly and certainly
the conclusions to which it leads.

In spite of the air of pretension about the title-page, the author seems
a modest, sensible man. Indeed, the seemingly ostentatious manner in
which he connects Edition: current; Page: [412] his own name with the
words Experience and Induction, evidently arises from no worse cause
than his understanding those terms in a peculiar sense. Else, what can
he mean by saying that Lord Bacon was the discoverer of induction? (P.
6.) Lord Bacon was not the inventor of eyes and ears. The first person
who discovered that fire burns, found it out by induction. Experience,
in the received language both of philosophy and of the world, means
seeing and feeling; and induction, judging from what we see and feel.
But in our author’s sense, the two words mean, not the operations
themselves, but some contrivances of our own to help us in performing
those operations.

Not to dwell longer on the title, however, but to speak of the work
itself; Dr. Todd has the merit of perceiving clearly and strongly the
imperfect condition in which those branches of knowledge mostly remain,
wherein we are chiefly dependant upon mere observation; as compared with
those in which we possess almost unlimited power of making experiments,
that is, of producing at pleasure such new combinations of
circumstances, as we have reason to think will afford us a further
insight into the laws of nature. To feel this imperfection of our
existing knowledge, as vividly and keenly as Dr. Todd does, is already
no inconsiderable indication of a philosophic intellect. If all who
profess to be thinkers, had barely reached this one point of attainment,
the knowledge of our present ignorance—the mouths of nine-tenths of the
noisy persons we meet with in the world, would be closed, and the
remaining tenth would seriously bestir themselves to acquire knowledge,
instead of spending their time in trying to persuade themselves and
other people that they have already got it. There would be an end at
once, for example, to those clamorous appeals we daily hear, on the most
complicated questions of state policy, to what are termed facts, that
is, to history and statistics, by men, the sum total of whose knowledge
of facts in history and statistics (though perhaps clever, well-informed
men) is like an insect’s knowledge of the great earth; and their
inductions, very like an oyster’s conjectures of the laws which govern
the universe.

Dr. Todd, seeing the little progress which has been made towards a
sufficient induction in the sciences of mere observation, and how
inadequate to most practical purposes our experience has hitherto been,
or else how inadequately that experience has yet been turned to account;
being also well read in the standard works on logic and metaphysics, and
in particular, being profoundly versed in the Novum Organum; very
laudably determined to do what lay in him towards following up Lord
Bacon’s great enterprise, and be himself also, in some sort, a reformer
in philosophy. And in what he has done, it would be unjust to deny that
there is both merit and utility, though we much question its power to
produce such great results as he seems partly to expect from it.

The investigation of nature, consists in ascertaining by experience what
are the facts which constantly occur in conjunction with one another.
Whatever be the phenomenon which is the subject of inquiry, we discover
the law of that Edition: current; Page: [413] phenomenon, by
ascertaining what are the circumstances which are invariably found to be
present whenever it occurs.

Now, this being the case, Dr. Todd’s plan is as follows:—To note down
carefully all the circumstances of all the instances, or experiments,
and arrange them in tables; the form of which tables, aided by a system
of signs rather ingeniously contrived, shows at once, and almost at a
glance, what are the circumstances which have been found to occur
together in all the instances, and what are those which have been found
not to occur together at all, or not with any regularity. If this were
done, Dr. Todd thinks that much valuable experience would be preserved
which is now lost, and that all the various generalizations which can be
legitimately drawn from the instances which have been examined, would
appear by simply reading off the signs. The principle on which the
process rests, we give in his own words:

To recapitulate; having by the first process, the classification by
affirmative circumstances, arranged and assorted the circumstances of
all the instances, and formed them into classes; and having, by the
second process of exclusion, or classification by negative
circumstances, rejected from the classes all such circumstances as are
not found constantly to belong to them; the circumstances which remain
of each class may be collected and arranged together. Not having been
able, by the evidence of any instance or individual fact, to separate
these circumstances from each other, or from their class, it is allowed
to conclude that they are connected with each other by some natural
relation, either as cause or effect of each other as causes of a common
effect, or effects of a common cause.

(Pp. 37-8.)

There is no doubt that where the complication of the subject is such,
that it is impossible for the mind to take in at once the whole range of
the evidence which it has to examine and decide upon, it becomes
indispensable to bring our experience into a more compact and manageable
shape. The utility of synoptic tables, for this purpose, is well known.
And, of the immense increase of power which may be obtained by a
well-contrived method of abridged notation, we have a memorable example
in algebra; without the aid of which, our knowledge of the properties of
numbers could never have reached much beyond common arithmetic. Dr.
Todd’s is a contrivance somewhat similar. And that some invention of
this sort will one day be brought into common use, for registering and
methodizing the logical results of any extensive and varied series of
observations, appears to us extremely probable. We only doubt whether
the logical operation itself, which this plan is intended to facilitate,
is one from which any great discoveries in philosophy are likely to
flow.

In fact, when we consider the past history of philosophy, we find that
not one of the great truths which have changed the face of science, was
discovered in the manner which Lord Bacon and the author before us have
laid down, namely, by collating an immense variety of very complicated
instances, until, in the midst of the apparently inextricable confusion,
there manifested itself something like an Edition: current; Page: [414]
invariable order, or law. This is altogether a mistaken view of the
nature of philosophical discovery; and Lord Bacon has here proved a
false prophet. All the great laws of nature, yet known, have been
ascertained by the observation of a few very simple, and generally very
familiar phenomena; under circumstances of little complication, where
the result of the experiment was not found liable to vary at each
repetition from the effect of other unknown causes; where, therefore,
that constancy of co-existence or of sequence, which constitutes the law
of nature, is visible without any cumbrous apparatus of comparison, such
as Lord Bacon conceived, and as our author has attempted to realize.
These simple laws having thus been first brought to light in the simple
cases, it was afterwards found, that we had only to suppose the same
laws to be in operation universally—and all the phenomena of the more
complex cases, however perplexed and intricate they had at first
appeared, were, without any difficulty, fully accounted for.

Thus, (to use an example at once the grandest and the most familiar)
when Newton discovered the laws of the motions of the heavenly bodies,
it was not by comparing and collating a long series of astronomical
observations. His conclusions were even, in many respects, contrary to
those which had seemed to result from the method of direct observation.
He did indeed most carefully and scrupulously examine every fact which
authentic observation had brought to light respecting the solar system;
but he did so, not in order to educe a theory from these facts, but to
ascertain whether they corresponded to a theory already framed. The
three laws of motion, the law of gravitation, and that of the
composition of forces, had been ascertained in an unerring manner, by
the simplest and most familiar experience; but experience confined of
course to this earth. It occurred to Newton, that by merely supposing
that these same laws extended to the whole solar system, all those
phenomena of the sun, moon, and planets, which had till then been
considered of so peculiar and mysterious a nature, might possibly be
explained. And so, upon examination, it turned out. And in consequence
of this discovery, there is scarcely any other science at the present
day so perfect as astronomy; although (and this is one of the remarkable
circumstances) a science of pure observation; for all mankind could not
make the sun or moon budge an inch from its place, by their united
efforts. But if we had remained destitute of the Newtonian theory till
we could deduce it by generalization from the observed phenomena of the
heavens, we probably should never, even with the aid of our author’s
tabulae inveniendi,1 have made any nearer approach to it than Kepler’s
discoveries.2

Edition: current; Page: [415]
We suspect that, when any more comprehensive views shall be arrived at,
or any greater certainty shall hereafter be attained, in the sciences,
physical, moral, or political, than we at present enjoy, it will be in
some such way as Newton’s, rather than by the road which our author has
taken so much pains in marking out. We can illustrate this by a recent
and highly interesting example. Among the branches of knowledge which
our author has pointed out as standing in most need of an improved
method of induction, is Meteorology. Has he ever read Mr. Daniell’s
admirable work on that subject?3 If he have, he must be aware in how low
a state that distinguished natural philosopher found his science, if
science it could be called in which not one leading principle was
ascertained; and to how respectable a rank among the sciences he
instantly raised it, by simply reversing the course theretofore pursued;
no longer attempting a direct induction from the results of atmospheric
observation, but starting from laws of nature previously ascertained
under less intricate circumstances—namely, the laws of evaporation and
condensation, the properties of elastic fluids, and especially those of
air and aqueous vapour; and examining synthetically how many of the
phenomena with which meteorology is conversant, these laws would suffice
to explain. The result was, that he found he could explain them almost
all; and there now remains a much smaller residuum of atmospheric
phenomena yet unaccounted for, than almost any one had been inclined, à
priori, to set down to the account of agents yet unknown.

Dr. Todd might have dissected meteorological observations without limit,
and persevered till doomsday in “translating circumstances into signs,”
before his “induction by classification” would have led him to such a
result as this. [Pp. 24, 54.]

We regret that, instead of only giving blank forms, Dr. Todd has not
presented us with a specimen of his art, by the actual analysis of some
interesting set of instances. If he had done this, nothing, we think,
could have prevented him from seeing how much less his method is capable
of effecting than he imagines, towards removing the difficulties of
induction. Suppose, for example (as Dr. Todd considers his plan
peculiarly adapted to inquiries respecting the mind), that the subject
of investigation were the formation of character, and the instances
individual men and women: has Dr. Todd ever considered what would be
implied in a complete enumeration of the circumstances of each instance?
It would include the whole history of the life of each of the
individuals. Suppose that the subject were politics, and the instances
nations: has he calculated the number of square miles which his tables
would cover? To begin with a single instance, as, for example, England:
we should like to see Dr. Todd attempt the analysis of this instance.
Every law on our statute-book, every decision of a judge, which has
passed into a law; every book which is in the hands of our Edition:
current; Page: [416] youth; every idea or opinion, every feeling, every
habit of thought or of conduct, which prevails among our people or among
any class of our people; all the natural qualities inherent in our soil,
in our climate, in our geographical position; every invention we have
produced in the useful, or every work of genius in the fine arts; the
constitution of our schools, of our universities, of our corporations,
of our learned societies, of our church; nay, even the personal
character of every individual in every rank of life who has any
character that can be properly termed his own: and in addition to this,
all the thousand-and-one accidents which are daily happening, or have
happened any day for the last thousand years, tending to modify more or
less the relations in which we stand to one another, to other countries,
and to external nature. All this would be but a part of the analysis of
one single instance. We ask Dr. Todd whether he seriously believes that
the certainty he desiderates can be attained in politics, by collating a
few (and the world affords but a few) instances of such vast and
unmanageable complication?

And, after all, Dr. Todd’s method, if it were practicable and fulfilled
its ends, would afford no help towards resolving the most difficult part
of the problem—namely, to know whether the induction is sufficient. This
does not depend upon the mere number of the instances. For it is evident
that we should learn much more of the nature of animals, for instance,
by examining one quadruped, one bird, and one fish, than by examining a
hundred sparrows or a hundred eels.

Yet such methods as Dr. Todd’s are of very considerable use. Though they
may never directly lead to scientific knowledge, they often, on subjects
of empirical and probable evidence, afford an approximation to it,
sufficient to be of practical use. They afford data for what is called
the calculation of chances. The best knowledge we have, is often merely
knowledge that certain things happen more frequently than not; without
our being able to perceive in what circumstances the cases of exception
differ from those which constitute the rule. Now, any process which
methodises the substance of any great number of observed cases, and
reduces them within moderate compass, attracts attention to combinations
which had not before been suspected to be other than casual, and the
knowledge of which, besides being of use for the guidance of conduct,
probably suggests experiments which in time may bring to light a general
law. Dr. Todd’s tables and system of signs seem not ill adapted to be of
this kind of use. They will show, no doubt, in very many cases, that
some conjunctions of circumstances take place more frequently than
others—when, from the vastness and intricacy of the field of
observation, this had not before been perceived. And medicine, Dr.
Todd’s own subject, being one of those in which mankind have hitherto
been least successful in discovering general laws, and are obliged to
rely most on empirical observation; Dr. Todd’s method, by extending the
range of such observation, may contribute to the enlargement of our
knowledge and the increase of our power, in a degree sufficient to
entitle its author to considerable gratitude, and his name to lasting
remembrance.

145.: FRENCH NEWS [48]
 EXAMINER, 19 FEB., 1832, P. 121

For the entry in Mill’s bibliography, see No. 116. The item, headed
“London, February 19, 1832,” is listed as “Article on France” and
enclosed in square brackets in the Somerville College set of the
Examiner.

several important retrenchments have been carried in the Chamber against
the French Ministry; while others of still greater importance have been
lost.1 On the whole, however, there appears fair promise of a saving
considerably exceeding the ten millions of francs (£400,000), beyond
which the Commission thought that retrenchment could not go.

The Ministers have been assailed with vigour in the Chamber for their
prosecutions of the press, and of the Saint Simonians.2 We trust that
these attacks will continue, and that the Opposition will never relax
their exertions till they have extorted from the Ministry a real liberty
of the press, and real security against arbitrary imprisonment. It is
monstrous that such powers should exist as have been exerted in the
recent case of M. Lennox, who has been detained in prison for nine
months on a charge of a pretended Bonapartist conspiracy, and only now
brought before the Chambre de mis en accusation, a body of judges
performing the function of our grand juries, who have decided that there
was no ground for putting him on his trial.3 But who is to compensate M.
Lennox for his nine months’ confinement?

There seems to be nothing like a habeas corpus act in France. M. Roger,
a member of the Opposition, brought into the Chamber of Deputies a bill
of that nature several months ago: it has not yet come on for
discussion, and cannot now pass in this session, if at all.4

M. Casimir Périer and his colleagues are constantly preaching respect to
the law, and holding up what they term l’ordre légal as the one and only
thing Edition: current; Page: [418] needful in France.5 “Liberty,” said
the Prime Minister in one of his recent speeches, “is the despotism of
the law.”6 This curious definition—according to which no amount of
tyranny and slavery inflicted by means of bad laws, constitutes an
infringement of liberty—cannot but be deemed peculiarly insolent and
odious in France. For, the laws of France have been enacted at so many
periods of distraction and difficulty, and under so great a variety of
bad governments, that until they are revised, and purged of all which is
inconsistent with the new order of things, but which has never been
formally repealed, there is no stretch of power for which legal
authority cannot somewhere be found. Decrees of the revolutionary
governments and of the empire, which all the world thought had long
fallen into utter desuetude, are continually raked up and recalled from
oblivion, for the purposes of arbitrary power. The “despotism of the
law” in France, is but a polite expression for the despotism of the
Minister for the time being. It will hardly be believed that the famous
article 291 of the penal code, which interdicts all public meetings
without the consent of the government, and under which the meetings of
the Amis du Peuple and of the Saint Simonians have been put an end to,
was originally a decree of the Convention, passed during the reign of
Robespierre, and re-enacted by Napoleon in the code pénal, from its
suitableness to the purposes of his despotism.7 This reminds us of
another curious circumstance. It is, we believe, a fact, that the
Bourbons, on their restoration, freed themselves from their just debts,
by taking advantage of the decree of the Convention which annulled all
engagements with them, and rendered all correspondence with them a
criminal offence.8 In virtue of this decree, they not only took back St.
Cloud, but have never indemnified the intermediate occupant for the
trees he had planted, and which had become valuable timber.9 Well is it
said, “Put not your trust in princes.”10

The Times declares the motion for abolishing the compulsory observance
of Sundays and holidays, to be a gratuitous insult to Christianity.11 It
might as well Edition: current; Page: [419] be asserted that
Christianity is gratuitously insulted, because people are not bound by
legal penalties to go to church. The logic of the Times is precisely
that of the Inquisition. How hard it seems to be for some people to
understand, that it is possible to have a conscience, without seeking to
compel men whose conscience is different, to square their conduct by
yours.

The same journal is facetious upon the motion of M. Salverte, for
transferring, after a certain period, the remains of great men to the
national edifice called the Pantheon.12 Has the Times ever heard of such
a thing as burial in St. Paul’s, or in Westminster Abbey? Methinks such
things have been deemed, in other countries than France, suitable
testimonials of public respect, but perhaps the Times considers no
achievements but those of a warlike character as of sufficient dignity
and value, to warrant such a mode of commemorating the dead, and
inciting the living to go and do likewise. Such, at least, would seem to
have been the judgment of those who, in England, have been the
dispensers of these honours. In surveying the interior of St. Paul’s, it
is difficult to behold without a certain feeling of shame, a hundred
Lord Howes, and but a single Howard.13


146.: FEMALE EMIGRANTS

This note (in square brackets) is appended to a letter in the “Political
Examiner” headed “To the Editor of the Examiner,”1 in which reference is
made to No. 139, where Mill had responded to the address of the Dundee
operatives. Described in Mill’s bibliography as “A paragraph in answer
to a letter from ‘the female operatives of [Todmorden]’ in the Examiner
of 26th February 1832” (MacMinn, p. 19), the item is listed as
“Paragraph on a letter from ‘the Female Operatives of Todmorden’ ” and
enclosed in square brackets in the Somerville College set of the
Examiner.

we are much flattered by the favourable opinion of our fair Lancashire
friends. To meet the case of females having no legitimate claim on any
male relative for support, the interdiction might be confined to married
females, and Edition: current; Page: [420] those whose parents are alive
and not in the receipt of parish relief. But in spite of our
correspondent’s jocular remarks on female emigrants, we must observe,
that young women who have no parents or other near relatives to support
and protect them, are exactly the persons to whom emigration holds out
the greatest advantages. Our correspondent need not fear that on her
first landing in Australia or Canada, the alternative will be
straightway offered her, to marry or starve. On the contrary, labour of
all kinds is so scarce, and consequently so highly paid, that for as
long a period as she may prefer a single life, she may depend upon
earning, with very moderate exertions, an abundant and comfortable
subsistence.

the chamber of deputies has disappointed the wishes of M. Casimir
Périer, by making considerable reductions in the salaries of many of the
high officers of state.1 This is so far well; but there is a much wider
field of retrenchment open to them. Offices, great and small, are far
too numerous: a reduction of their number would produce a far greater
saving than a diminution of the emoluments.

The Chamber of Peers, which is daily setting itself more and more
decidedly in opposition to the Deputies and to the nation, has
determined that the anniversary of the execution of Louis XVI shall
continue to be kept as a dies non by the courts of justice and the
public offices.2 It is strange infatuation to incur the obloquy and
danger of running counter to the national feeling for a matter of such
trifling importance. The French people do not approve of the sentence
upon Louis XVI, but they do not think it more iniquitous than a thousand
other acts, both of the Revolution and of the ancien régime; they see no
reason, therefore, for solemnizing it by any peculiar observances. They
bear a particular aversion, moreover, to this celebration, because it
was imposed upon them by the émigrés in 1816, as a studied insult to the
defeated party. It is felt, and was intended to be felt, as an act of
national penance and humiliation, much more for having attempted a
republican government, than for having put a good kind of man to death
without just cause.

The four young men, members of the Société des Amis du Peuple, who were
arrested on pretence of being concerned in the late Carlist conspiracy,
have been set at liberty.3 There was no ground for proceeding against
them, and this was probably known from the first; but it is a favourite
scheme of M. Périer, to propagate the belief, that the two extremes of
opinion have united against his juste milieu.

The case of the Duc de Bourbon’s will has been decided in favour of the
legatees.4 We are not minutely acquainted with the procedure of the
French Edition: current; Page: [422] courts; but it seems strange, that
judgment should have passed after hearing only the speeches of counsel,
without examining a single witness.

the court of cassation has confirmed the iniquitous sentence, by which
five members of the Society of the Friends of the People, after being
acquitted by the jury, were sentenced by the Judges to periods of
imprisonment, for what they said in their defence.1 “Some months’
imprisonment,” says the mealy-mouthed correspondent of the Times.2 Yes,
good sir; six, twelve, and fifteen months imprisonment, besides fines.
And it is but justice to say, that the speeches of MM. Blanqui and
Thouret, two of these persecuted men, were such as almost any man might
be proud of.3

One of the correspondents of the Times, on Thursday last, after railing
at the Chamber of Deputies for its retrenchments, and bitterly lamenting
the error which was committed in extending the elective franchise, calls
on the Times to give the aid of its pen to the enemies of cheap
government in France, and to tell them how much more wisely we order
these things in England.4 We trust that this Paris correspondence is
read; and that the indications it gives, of the real spirit of the
Journal which publishes it, are not thrown away.

The reason why no witnesses were heard in the law-suit on the will of
the Duc de Bourbon5 is, that in French law oral testimony is not
received to invalidate a will, unless a certain primâ facie case can be
made out; which, in this case, the Court did not consider to have been
established. The decision has been appealed from, and the cause will
next be brought before the Cour Royale.

“London, March 11, 1832,” is listed as “Article on the French expedition
to Ancona” and enclosed in square brackets in the Somerville College set
of the Examiner.

the french expedition to Italy, which has landed and taken possession of
Ancona, has excited much speculation and remark, mostly of a
vituperative kind, in the English newspapers.1 M. Périer has not yet
made any declaration of the purposes with which this expedition was
undertaken; but there is little difficulty in conjecturing their nature.
The truth apparently is, that M. Périer, however reluctant to incur any
danger of war, in order to prevent free principles and free
institutions, in a foreign country, from being overwhelmed by an
invading army, has none of these scruples when the matter at stake is
what, in the old slang, were called national interests,—that is to say,
preventing some other country from obtaining any accession of territory
and power. Accordingly we see the consequence. The patriots of central
Italy attempted to establish a free government; Austria interfered by
force, put a stop to their proceedings, and M. Périer had nothing to
say. The Italian patriots having been baffled in this first attempt, and
finding that they had no chance of establishing a free government as
long as Italy is cut up into little straggling principalities, are now
willing to acquiesce in any government which will restore their
nationality; and to that end are ready to join with Austria, if Austria
will turn out the Pope, and unite all Italy under its own dominion. And
this is obviously the next best thing to what they attempted at first;
but this will not suit M. Périer. That personage has no objection to let
Austria govern the Italians through their detestable native governments,
but he has no idea of allowing her to govern them directly and avowedly,
when there would be some chance of her governing them comparatively
well. Thus French interference at present, is as hostile to the good
government of Italy, as French non-interference was before. As England
and France allowed Russia to swallow up Poland, but would not hear of
permitting her to conquer Turkey, so now the mutual jealousies of France
and Austria appear to show themselves precisely where there is some good
to be prevented, after having remained dormant where there was any good
to be done.

the new corn bill proposed by the French Ministry, has, at length, been
returned by the Commission appointed by the Chamber to report upon it.
Their report, the production of the statistical M. Charles Dupin, is a
compromise between right and wrong.1 We do not mean that its principles
are true, but so tempered in their application as to soften the
transition, and avoid defeating existing expectations: this we should
not disapprove. What we object to is, that the principles themselves are
neither true nor false, but half-and-half; a piece of theoretical
patchwork, a kind of juste-milieu mosaic, a square of black and a square
of white alternately. It is as if the Newtonian system had to be voted
by show of hands; and the parties being unable to convince one another,
agreed to a resolution that there was much truth in Newton’s principles,
but that Ptolemy also had a good deal to say.

The recommendations of the Commission are, however, a considerable
improvement upon what exists; and the Bill is to be discussed this
session. The debate is to come between the voting of the Estimates and
that of the Ways and Means.

The Ministry are desirous of voting in the present session, or in
another to commence almost immediately after, the Budget of the ensuing
year, as well as that of the present;2 in order to return to the
salutary practice of not expending any of the nation’s money upon mere
votes of credit, when the Estimates have not been regularly laid before
the Chamber and discussed. We know not how the Deputies will relish this
prolongation of their labours. The Chambers have sat almost without
intermission since the Revolution of July; one respite of a month in the
latter part of 1830, and another of less than six weeks, mostly occupied
in the general election, and in the preparations for it, have formed the
only interval of leisure. Yet it is astonishing how little business they
have found time to transact. None of the most important Bills presented
in this session, that on the Peerage excepted,3 have yet come on for
discussion. It is true, the Chamber of Deputies does not sit at an
average so much as four hours out of the twenty-four.

151.: SMART’S OUTLINE OF SEMATOLOGY [1]
 EXAMINER, 25 MAR., 1832, P. 195

This review of a work by Benjamin Humphrey Smart (ca. 1786-1872),
teacher of elocution and author of manuals and pronouncing dictionaries,
is of importance to Mill’s speculations about logic and truth. For the
second and concluding part, see No. 153. Both reviews are in the
“Literary Examiner.” This first part is headed “An Outline of
Sematology; or an Essay towards establishing a New Theory of Grammar,
Logic, and Rhetoric. [London: Richardson,] 1831.” The review is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “A review of a work entitled ‘An
Outline of Sematology,’ in two parts, the first of which on the study of
Metaphysics; both signed A.B. In the Examiner of 25th March 1832 and 1st
April 1832.” (MacMinn, p. 20.) In the Somerville College set, where it
is listed as “Review of ‘An Outline of Sematology’ ” and enclosed in
square brackets, there is one correction: at 426.36, “others” is altered
to “other”.

it is singular, that in an age like this, when old systems of opinions
and of things are crumbling in pieces, and that spirit of scepticism
which metaphysical pursuits are supposed to engender, pervades the great
majority of educated minds, the study of metaphysics should be held in
discredit, rather than in honour. Upon the causes of this fact it would
be interesting to speculate; but at present we shall only say of the
fact itself, that among civilized nations it seems to be peculiar to
ourselves. The tendency of the Germans to metaphysical speculation is
well known; and in France the word Philosophy continues, even in the
schools, to be appropriated as it was originally by Socrates, (the
inventor of the term) to the science of mind, exclusively; while in
England, which has produced so many illustrious names in that department
of thought, the man who can analyse a pebble is held in greater
estimation that he who can analyse the mind of man.

It is time that this should cease; for, if metaphysics unsettles men’s
minds, metaphysics also must settle them; the doubts which it raises, it
alone is able to solve. If there is any period in man’s history in which
the scientific study of the human mind is indispensable, it is at a
period of moral transition like the present; when those general creeds,
which had kept the diversities of individual character in subordination
by a common rule of right, are breathing their last—and others, more
adapted to the present condition of the species, are slowly and with
difficulty evolving themselves out of the shapeless and tumultuous chaos
of conflicting opinions. The ancient doctrines will never more regain
the ascendancy they have lost: the causes which have overthrown them are
not causes which ever pass away. That unity of doctrine, however, which
formerly existed, must exist once more, though under other auspices, ere
man can yet again have earnest, solemn convictions, and yield willing
obedience to a new and steady rule of life. Now, this unity of doctrine
can only be brought about through Edition: current; Page: [426]
metaphysics; for when all the questions most deeply interesting to human
nature are under discussion, each man deciding them according to his
personal predilections, the philosophy of mind is the only common
arbiter to whom all can appeal, and who can constrain all to acknowledge
his authority.

There are indeed to be found men, the depth of whose sensibility, and
the vigour and comprehensiveness of whose imagination, enable them to
summon up within themselves all the varieties of feeling incident to the
human constitution; to see, at pleasure, any subject, as it would be
seen by persons of all dispositions and turns of mind; and so, to
understand and sympathize with human nature in all its diversities. Such
were Shakspeare, Göthe, and perhaps one or two other persons since the
creation of the world. But in general, man’s capacity of putting himself
into the position of another man, and identifying himself with that
man’s feelings and modes of thinking, when these are any way different
from his own, is extremely limited. Most men, in consequence, regard the
feelings and ideas excited in men of an opposite character to
themselves, by objects which excite no such feelings in them, as
monstrous and unnatural; or at least, radically wrong, and meriting no
kind of consideration or allowance, either in reasoning or in
conduct:—and few can feel the force of any argument which is either
founded on, or addressed to, feelings in which they themselves do not
participate. Hence we have hundreds of systems founded on the partial
views of one-sided minds; and each half or quarter truth, instead of
seeking out all the remaining fractions, and uniting with them, shuns
them, or endeavours to beat them down by violence.

Now, the only permanent cure for this is metaphysics. The analytical
philosophy of mind, can alone enable persons of dissimilar characters to
understand one another. It explains, from data which all have within
them, the genesis and growth of the most opposite mental habits. It
expounds, not only how each habit was likely to originate, but what are
the other habits with which each is naturally connected, what those of
which it is naturally exclusive; and is thus enabled to sit in judgment
upon the many conflicting modes of feeling and thinking, and pronounce
which of them are, and which are not, founded in any real defect, either
of the understanding or of the heart. Through the reconciling medium of
this great interpreter, we discover, nine times out of ten, that what we
fancied to be sheer error, had perhaps as much of truth in it as our own
contrary opinion; that what we ascribed to a mental defect, really arose
from some good quality, not excessive in itself, but unaccompanied by
some other which ought to have qualified and corrected it, and which,
again, in our own mind, stands as much in need of correction from the
former, over which, in its turn, it unduly predominates. And we learn,
that instead of eradicating, or restraining the growth of a feeling, or
a faculty, the only proper method, almost in every case, of guarding
against its excesses, is by cultivating other feelings and faculties up
to it.

Edition: current; Page: [427]
It is chiefly through metaphysics, that men can thus be brought
practically to understand and admit, that feelings of which they
themselves are incapable, are nevertheless legitimate feelings; and to
correct their own partial views, by means of the partial views of other
people. And so naturally do these effects seem to follow from habits of
metaphysical analysis, that as it has been said that an astronomer must
of necessity be pious, so we are almost tempted to say that it is
impossible for a real metaphysician to be one-sided, intolerant, or
scornful. How much this is at variance with the notion commonly
entertained of metaphysicians, we are not ignorant: nor do we affirm
that notion to be always destitute of foundation. It has befallen this
science, as well as many others, that men have resorted to it less to
form opinions, than to find reasons for opinions already held. And it
has been the misfortune of this science, even more than of most others,
that whereas its subject-matter is peculiarly concrete, and immersed in
circumstances, the inquiries of those who cultivate it have, on the
contrary, rested for the most part in the highest regions of abstract
generality; insomuch that the same person, who may excel all others in
analysing belief, or memory, or perception, or any other of the mental
phenomena common to all mankind, would perhaps be farther to seek than
many common men, if called upon to shew that he understood any one
individual human mind, and could tell what are the few leading
peculiarities which make it, in all important particulars, what it is.
This however will not always be the case: it is not the case with all
metaphysicians, even now; and if metaphysicians have not yet done all
that ought to be required of them, it remains not the less true, that
any one who has it in view to improve the moral nature of man through
the understanding, can in no way dispense with an accurate and
analytical study of the human mind.

These observations have been drawn from us by what is now no frequent
occurrence, the publication of a new, and a clever and interesting work,
on a portion of metaphysics. The book demands observations of greater
length than we have left ourselves room to insert in the present number;
we shall therefore return to it in our next.

there have been some disturbances at Grenoble, apparently not
premeditated, Edition: current; Page: [428] but arising from a carnival
frolic which took a political turn. All is now quiet.1

An important point has been carried in favour of the liberty of the
press. Not contented with such verdicts as could be obtained against
newspapers from Paris juries, M. Périer resolved, that as he found it
difficult to get leave to punish his political opponents after trial, he
would try whether it was feasible to punish them before. He accordingly
commenced the practice of throwing journalists into prison as soon as
process had commenced against them. After this had been done four times
(the monstrous illegality was only attempted once during the sixteen
years of the restoration; and in this one case, that of M.
Cauchois-Lemaire,2 the explosion of public indignation was such as
prevented the act of tyranny from being repeated), M. Armand Carrel, the
principal editor of the National, published in his paper a declaration,
signed with his name, that if such illegal violence should be attempted
against himself, he would resist it by force, as he would any other
assault upon his person or property.3 The Ministry, hereupon,
discontinued the obnoxious practice, but prosecuted M. Carrel, and the
editors of another paper, who had adhered, as the French phrase is, to
his declaration.4 They have now been tried, and acquitted. This
usurpation, therefore, is knocked on the head.

The Chamber continues to make various retrenchments; not indeed of great
amount, but sufficient to excite the bile of M. Casimir Périer, who has
accused the Deputies to their faces of an “esprit de vertige,” and
“jalousie des supériorités sociales,” because they reduced a few
salaries.5 The people now in power actually make a point of honour of
their cupidity: they hold fast to the national purse-strings, with the
feelings with which a soldier defends his post. Marshal Soult, the
Minister of War, being accused of receiving, in defiance of an existing
law, his emoluments as Minister, and his emoluments as a Marshal
besides, burst out into a passionate exclamation, that his salary should
only be Edition: current; Page: [429] torn from him with his life. On ne
me l’ôtera qu’avec la vie!6 These were his very words. A new species of
chivalry!

The French officer who broke open the gates of Ancona,7 is to be
brought, it is said, to a court-martial. The Pope goes on protesting
against the invasion of the French.8 His Holiness need not be alarmed.
The French will not dethrone him, nor even suffer the Austrians to do
so. The natural tendency of events when they are let alone is, that the
better Governments swallow up the worse; but “French interests” will not
allow this, though they allowed despotism to be re-established, and poor
Menotti to be hanged.9 When will it be felt in this country, that there
is more good in the most hot-headed republicans, than in the coterie of
jobbers, tricksters, and low intrigans who form the existing Government
of France!


153.: SMART’S OUTLINE OF SEMATOLOGY [2]
 EXAMINER, 1 APR., 1832, PP. 211-12

For the context and the entry in Mill’s bibliography, see No. 151. This
second part is headed “An Outline of Sematology; or, an Essay towards
establishing a New Theory of Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric. / (Concluded
from the Examiner of last week.)” It is listed as “Review of ‘An Outline
of Sematology’ concluded” and enclosed in square brackets in the
Somerville College set.

the principal fault of this work is its pretension to the character of a
New Theory. There is no room now for a new theory in the sciences here
treated of. We shall not, probably, be suspected of upholding old
opinions because they are old, and we are less inclined than almost any
one, to underrate the importance of original thinking. Much remains to
be done towards perfecting these sciences: the author before us has
contributed to this end something not inconsiderable, and has shown a
capacity, which, if fitly improved, may enable him to effect much more;
an abundant harvest will also remain for subsequent inquirers: but
whatever scope there may be for new theories of particular points, now
mysterious, or misunderstood, any thing which can justly be called a New
Edition: current; Page: [430] Theory of Grammar, Logic, or Rhetoric,
will most assuredly be erroneous. These subjects have now occupied the
attention of thinking men for upwards of two thousand years, without
intermission; and have formed the principal subject of the meditations
of some of the most powerful and comprehensive intellects, which the
world, we may safely predict, will ever see. No doubt, there still
remains to be done, much which they have left undone, and to be undone,
much which they have done. But it would argue a very slender faculty of
appreciating the mass of valuable truth which their successive labours
have called into existence, to imagine that what can be added to the
heap by any single individual, can ever bear more than a very
insignificant proportion to the entire bulk. A new contribution,
whatever may be its absolute importance, cannot now alter the face of a
science, as it might formerly have done. The most powerful thinker, in
constructing a scheme of the entire science, can be indebted for a small
part only of the materials to his own genius; the far greatest portion
will be derived from the thoughts of his predecessors. Indeed, the
greatest proof of genius, perhaps, which any person of our times has it
in his power to give, consists in being able to see the worth of
existing materials, from which half-taught mediocrity turns away in
scorn; to disengage a great and pregnant thought from the trammels of a
language suited to the comprehension of another age, or involving
philosophical theories now exploded, and clothe it in the phraseology of
the present day; to dare to think that a great man of a former age was
substantially in the right, when some flaw, unavoidably or unguardedly
left in the mere accidents of his theory, has sufficed to disguise the
intrinsic truth of its essentials from the intellects of the minute
philosophers who succeeded him. He who perpetually and systematically
does this, is a great man; for, the very attempt to do it, or the
conception of it as a thing proper to be done, seems to be a stretch of
intelligence which not many have attained to. Without it, however,
mankind would be no wiser after twenty generations than after one, since
each generation would be unable to profit by any inquiries but its own.

The author before us has not afforded this evidence of genius; yet he is
not so blind to the merits of his predecessors, as might be suspected
from his laying claim to be the founder of a new theory of Grammar,
Logic, and Rhetoric; that is, if the words have any meaning, to have
placed those three sciences upon an entirely new foundation. We fully
believe that whatever, in this work, is either expressly, or by
implication, laid claim to as original, has been the bonâ fide produce
of the writer’s own thoughts; and this is saying a great deal, even
where the thought has occurred to others before him. He often shows,
too, that he is acquainted with what others have done, and can
appreciate it; so often, as to make us confident that he will hereafter
feel the value of much which hitherto he has not known, or has not
appreciated.

His own contribution to philosophy consists fundamentally of one idea;
which Edition: current; Page: [431] having clearly conceived and firmly
grasped, he has followed it out into numerous ramifications, and traced
its bearings upon the general problems of Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric,
in a manner evincing no ordinary capacity for metaphysical
investigation. Where he has failed, it is, we suspect, from being in too
great a hurry to finish his book. We do not blame him for not carrying
the precept, nonum prematur in annum,1 into literal excecution; for we
should have been sorry to forego for so long a period the pleasure and
instruction which he has afforded us: but the results of any
intellectual process must suffer greatly by being given out to the world
the moment they are conceived in the author’s mind. The first principles
of the work are set forth in a manner giving token of mature
consideration; but as the exposition advances, marks of haste become
visible:—after having arrived at some results which he thought
important, the writer seems to have been impatient to bring the inquiry
to a conclusion, and has therefore not unfrequently stopped short in an
interesting train of thought, or left its results in a state of
vagueness, which is, we think, the source of the only material errors we
have to lay to his charge. This vagueness is by no means a general
characteristic, either of our author’s conceptions, or of his style;
both, wherever his mental powers seem to have been fully called into
play, are clear, vigorous, and masculine.

Sematology, from σήματα, signs, is the name which our author gives to
the doctrine of Language; the office of which, as an instrument of
thought, he well understands, and the several uses of which he considers
to form the subjects respectively of Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric. Now
the one idea, which is the basis of his speculations, is the following.

What we wish to communicate on any one occasion, by means of words, is
some state of our consciousness; say, for instance, the bodily sensation
we are experiencing at that particular moment. This we might express by
one single word, if we chose; as many things are expressed in a state of
nature by single cries. But, it being impossible to have a separate word
for every state of feeling which we desire to communicate, we are
obliged to express our states of feeling by a limited number of words,
variously combined. Now, (says our author,) although the state of
feeling we desire to express, may be complicated to any extent, and of
course susceptible of being analysed into parts; it is by no means true,
that the words which we put together to express this state of feeling,
will, when separated, express severally those parts. It is not true that
the meaning of a sentence, is made up of the separate meanings of the
words composing the sentence. If we take the separate meanings of the
separate words, and add them together, the sum total includes much more
than is intended to be conveyed by Edition: current; Page: [432] that
one sentence; for it includes all that we otherwise know of the objects
which we find it necessary to name in order to convey a notion of that
one matter of fact.

Let us take, for our first fact, the cry for food of a new-born infant.
That is an instinctive cry, wholly unconnected, we presume, with reason
and knowledge. In proportion as the knowledge grows, that the want, when
it occurs, can be supplied, the cry becomes rational, and may at last be
said to signify, “Give me food,” or, more at full, “I want you to give
me food.” In what does the rational cry (rational when compared with the
instinctive cry) differ from the still more rational sentence?—Not in
its meaning, but simply thus, that the one is a sign suggested directly
by nature, and the other is a sign arising out of such art, as, in its
first acquirement, (we are about to presume) nature, or necessity,
gradually teaches our species. Now, that the artificial sign is made up
of parts, (namely the words that compose the sentence) and that the
natural sign is not made up of significant parts, we affirm to be simply
a consequence of the constitution of artificial speech, and not to
follow from any thing in the nature of the communication which the mind
has to make. The natural cry, if understood, is, for the purpose in
view, quite as good as the sentence, nor does the sentence, as a whole,
signify any thing more. Taking the words separately, there is indeed
much more contained in the sentence than in the cry, namely, the
knowledge of what it is to give, under other circumstances, as well as
that of giving food; of food, under other circumstances, as well as that
of being given to me; of me, under other circumstances, as well as that
of wanting food; but all this knowledge, in this and similar cases for
which a cry might suffice, is unnecessary, and the indivisible sign, if
equally understood for the actual purpose, is, for this purpose, quite
adequate to the artificially compounded sign.

[Pp. 7-8.]

. . . Collectively, that is in sentences, they (words) can signify any
perception by the senses, or conception arising from such perception,
any desire, emotion or passion—in short, any impression which nature
would have prompted us to signify by an indivisible sign, if such a sign
could have been found:—but individually (we repeat) each word belonging
to such sentence, or to any sentence, is not the sign of any idea
whatever which the mind passively receives, but of an abstraction which
reason obtains by acts of comparison and judgment upon its
passively-received ideas. The sentence, “John walks,” may express what
is actually perceived by the senses; but neither word, separately, can
be said to express a part of that perception, since the perception is of
John walking, and if we perceive John separate from walking, then he is
not walking, and consequently it is another perception; and so, if we
perceive walking separate from John, it must be that we perceive
somebody else walking, and not him. The separate words, then, do not
stand for passively-received ideas, but for abstract notions:—so far as
they express what is perceived by the senses, they have no separate
meaning; it is only with reference to the understanding that each has a
separate meaning. The separate meaning of the word John is a knowledge
that John has existed and will exist, independently of the present
perception, and the separate meaning of the word walks is a knowledge
that another may walk as well as John. This is not an idea of John or an
idea of walking such as the senses give, or such as memory revives; for
the senses present no such object as John in the abstract, that is,
neither walking, nor not walking; nor do they furnish any such idea as
that of walking independently of one who walks. There is then a double
force in these words,—their separate force, which is derived from the
understanding, and their united force, by which, in this instance, they
signify a perception by the senses.

[P. 10.]

This, as the reader will have perceived, is far from new; but it has
never, Edition: current; Page: [433] perhaps, been presented precisely
in this manner. Most metaphysical writers of name have said the same
thing, or things distinctly implying it:—equally true is it, however,
that they have said other things, as distinctly implying the contrary,
and that much of the received language seems to take for granted that
the meaning of a sentence is the sum of the meanings of the separate
words. Our author has, therefore, rendered a useful service, by making
the principle so clear, and illustrating it so copiously and forcibly,
that no one who reads him with due care and thought, will be in danger
of ever forgetting or overlooking it. And its consequences will be found
to be more important than most persons would at first suspect.

For instance, our author is, we think, perfectly right in deeming the
truth which he has expounded to be the only rational foundation for
philosophical grammar, affording the only explanation of the real nature
of the distinction among the parts of speech. It seems to be taken for
granted, says he,

That the parts of speech have their origin in the mind, independently of
the outward signs, when, in truth, they are nothing more than parts in
the structure of language. . . . We are not to confound the instrument
with the intelligence that uses it, nor to suppose that the parts of
which it is composed, have, of necessity, any parts corresponding with
them in the thought itself. It is not what a word signifies that
determines it to be this or that part of speech, but how it assists
other words in making up the sentence. . . . As to the meaning, that
does not of necessity differ because a word is a different part of
speech; the following words, for instance, all express the same notion:
Add, Addition, Additional, Additionally, With,* And.†

[Pp. 38-40.]

This view of the nature of the parts of speech accords in the main with
that taken in a work, with which our author is apparently unacquainted,
Mr. Mill’s Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind.2 It is not
surprising that both writers should have fallen into the same train of
thought, since it was evidently suggested to both by the etymological
discoveries of Horne Tooke.3

In the spirit of these general observations, our author proceeds to
inquire into the nature and object of each of the several parts of
speech. There is much instruction to be gathered from this part of the
work, and the results he brings out are, we think, substantially
correct. His definition of the verb appears to us to fall short of
perfect philosophical precision; the author should analyze more
particularly the meaning of a phrase he often uses; viz., to make a
communication. What is it we do when we assert a matter of fact, more
than when we merely suggest the idea of the same fact? What is the
difference between belief and simple conception? What do I communicate
when I say there is a God, Edition: current; Page: [434] more than when
I merely say God? When our author can answer this question, he will not
only be able to perfect his definition of a verb, but he will discover
that the distinction between the subject and the predicate of a
proposition, is something more than a merely grammatical distinction,
which is the notion he has of it.

The second chapter of the work, which relates to Logic, is that of which
we think least highly. We are not surprised that our author should join
in the common cry against the doctrine of the syllogism, since we find
it is his opinion that errors in philosophising are always in the
premises, and never in the reasoning process. But though men often
reason from false premises, or without taking into consideration all the
premises which might be obtained, it is surely very common also to
conclude from the premises which we have, more than those premises will
warrant. If our author will but duly advert to this circumstance, he
will, we think, discover that nearly all which he says respecting the
nature of the syllogism may be true, and the syllogistic doctrine may
nevertheless be of great utility. But a popular journal is not the
proper place for explaining ourselves fully on this topic.

Our author’s views as to the manner in which general terms serve us in
the investigation of truth, are just and profound, notwithstanding some
superficial inaccuracies and even contradictions, and although his
language in many places is far from satisfying us in point of
definiteness and precision, owing to his having not yet analyzed some of
his notions into their ultimate elements.

The third chapter, on Rhetoric, is, in our opinion, the best of all: it
is full of valuable truth and high moral feeling. We regret that the
length to which this notice has extended, renders it impossible for us
to attempt even the most meagre abstract of this portion of the work.

In addition to the other merits displayed in this volume, the author is
evidently no contemptible scholar. On the whole, there are few works
among those recently produced, which do so much credit to the writer.

What has most displeased us, is the tone with which, in more places than
one, the author permits himself to speak of so eminent a person as
Archbishop Whately, and which we are sure, on reflection, he must feel
to be unworthy of him. He naturally cannot value very highly the
Elements of Logic, from the opposite views which he himself entertains
on the subject, but even that work he admits to possess considerable
merit; and the author of the Elements of Rhetoric, the Lectures on the
study of Political Economy, and The Errors of Romanism traced to their
origin in Human Nature,4 has afforded evidences of intellectual power,
which might have been sufficient to protect him against this
disrespectful Edition: current; Page: [435] and jeering style of
criticism; a style which certainly would not be adopted by those, if any
such there be, who could be entitled to adopt it towards such a man.

the press and the chamber of deputies in France have, during the past
week, been chiefly occupied with angry discussions respecting the late
disturbances at Grenoble.1 It appears that several lives were lost, and
many persons wounded; and the Opposition represents the affair as a sort
of Manchester massacre, asserting that there was not the slightest
justification for calling in the troops. This seems also to be the
opinion of many competent witnesses who were present on the spot. What
makes the matter worse is, that M. Casimir Périer does not scruple (it
is said) to admit in private that the Préfet was greatly to blame,
though in public he associates himself in that magistrate’s
responsibility by sanctioning and commending his proceedings.2 This,
however, is in the spirit of his entire administration: his subordinates
are all made to understand that in the repression of tumults it is safe
to go too far, but fatal not to go far enough. The Cour Royale of
Grenoble has commenced a judicial investigation of the whole
transaction; so that if not justice, publicity at least may be counted
upon.

The Chamber, after interrupting the debate on the Budget in order to
discuss the new Corn Bill, has, strangely enough, broken off the
discussion of the Corn Bill to resume that of the Budget. The spirit of
most of the speeches yet delivered on this important bill has been
commendable. All, or nearly all, the speakers supported the measure,
either as brought forward by the Government or as altered by the
Commission: most were for the project of the Government, the most
liberal of the two. Even M. de Saint-Cricq declared for altogether
effacing the word prohibition from the corn laws of France.3

155.: FLOWER’S SONGS OF THE SEASONS
 EXAMINER, 8 APR., 1832, P. 230

For Mill’s first tribute to Eliza Flower, see No. 112. This item, in the
“Musical Review,” is headed “Songs of the Seasons. By the author of the
Musical Illustrations of the Waverley Novels. [London: Novello, 1832.]”
It is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A review of Miss Flower’s
‘Songs of the Seasons,’ in the Examiner of 8th April 1832” (MacMinn, p.
20). In the Somerville College set it is listed as “Review of Miss
Flower’s ‘Songs of the Seasons’ ” and enclosed in square brackets.

in the examiner of the 3d of July last, we paid such offering of
admiration as we knew how to give, to Miss Flower’s Musical
Illustrations of the Waverley Novels. If time and familiarity have shewn
us anything to regret in the testimony we then rendered to that
delightful work, it is that we hardly trusted ourselves to say all we
might have said in its praise, nor to try it by so high a standard as
that to which alone it can be referred, without a certain insensibility
to what constitutes its highest excellence. There is in every strain
that which denotes it to be the work not merely of an accomplished
musician, but of a mind penetrated with the spirit of a true artist; of
one who recognizes in art (what the mere trader in its productions, let
him trade for fame or money, will never see in it) a language for the
most earnest feelings of the most susceptible minds: for those feelings
which, when they vent themselves in articulate sounds, give birth to
poetry and eloquence—when in any other kind of language, to Art in all
its branches. The language which Miss Flower has chosen is music, and
she speaks it like one to whom none of its dialects is unfamiliar,
because none of the feelings to which it is appropriate, from the
loftiest to the most tender, is a stranger to her. When to these
qualities of the inmost nature, is added originality of melody, together
with adequate scientific knowledge of harmonic principles, we have all
which constitutes musical genius, in the highest and most exclusive
sense of the term. And whatever may be the place assigned to Miss Flower
among the comparatively few, whom this union of endowments entitles to
the rank of artists in music, that she belongs to the class, no
competent judge, we are persuaded, will for a moment doubt.

We welcome a new work from the same hand, with the greater pleasure, as
there are many motives not likely to be durable which may lead to the
appearance of a first production, but it is the second which shews that
the author has chosen her career—that she has found an answer to the
question which every mind of any inherent power asks itself, what it is
fittest for? in what manner the faculties which it possesses can be
called into fullest exercise, and turned to the most valuable account?
We are now authorized to hope that she will many more times Edition:
current; Page: [437] have to receive our thanks, for benefitting and
delighting us as she has already done.

The work before us consists of four songs, illustrative of the Four
Seasons. This design did not allow of such lofty flights as her “Lament
of Meg Merrilies” or her “Lady in St. Swithin’s Chair,”1 the unearthly
character of which could only correspond to words as solemn and
impressive; nor would the wild strains in which she has so
characteristically shadowed out the mental wanderings of the dying Madge
Wildfire, have suited an occasion where neither poetry nor music had
anything more to do than embellishing familiar objects. Her present
subject required not so much imagination as fancy, and a mind at peace
and in sympathy with all nature. There are minds to whom Autumn and
Winter are more congenial than Spring and Summer, or over whose emotions
at least, those gloomier seasons have greater command. The contrary
seems to be the case with Miss Flower; her disposition must be sunny and
cheerful, for it is evident to us, that her heart is in the first two of
her songs, and only her understanding in the two last.

The first in particular must be admired by every lover of chaste and
expressive music. It is one of the sweetest pastoral duets which has
been produced in this country for many years. Miss Flower, who is
usually happy in the choice of her words, has been indebted for them in
this case to a friend who is not named. They appear to us so delicate
and fanciful, that we permit ourselves the pleasure of quoting them at
length: they are worthy of the music, and the music of them.

    -   

        Flowers, come forth, ’tis Spring!

The second, “Summer,” we think little if at all inferior to the first.
The words Edition: current; Page: [438] (by the author’s sister)2 mingle
another expression with that belonging to the season, being a summons
from a lover to his mistress, to partake of its delights. Both the words
and the melody (the simplest of the collection) are overflowing with a
gentle and placid tenderness.

“Autumn” is less a favourite with us than any of the others: we have met
however, with persons who admired this most of them all. We should
praise it too, if the author had not so often far excelled it.

“Winter” is highly original, but sounds to us somewhat odd and uncouth:
perhaps because the rhythm of the words is unusual, and not very well
adapted for music. Nowhere has Miss Flower scattered the materials both
of melody and accompaniment with a more lavish hand, but we think she
has been less felicitious than usual in putting them together. The air
is not marked with that singleness of conception, which is the surest
indication, and indeed, the only rational definition ever given, of true
taste. It has the appearance of being not one air, but fragments of
several. In particular, there is in the very middle a startling
modulation from minor to major, which must have produced a great effect
if there were at that place any corresponding change of sentiment in the
words. A modulation exactly the converse of this, in “St. Swithin’s
Chair,” was extremely striking and characteristic: but the higher
resources of the art should be reserved for occasions to which its more
ordinary means are not adequate.

Miss Flower’s worst pieces, however, are superior to the best of many
popular composers, and her best are such as “will not willingly be let
die.”3 We hope for many more, both of the one and of the other.*

the total number of persons who have been attacked by the cholera in
Paris, from the commencement of the disease (that is, within one week)
is 1,052. Of these, 395 have died. When considered with relation to the
amount of population Edition: current; Page: [439] in the two cities,
the disease has been in the proportion of three to one more destructive
in Paris than in London. This greatly exceeds any proportion which we
should have anticipated from the comparative unhealthiness, and greater
average rate of mortality, in ordinary times, in Paris than in London.

The epidemic has also appeared in several parts of France
simultaneously, and all quarantine restrictions have consequently been
withdrawn.

There has been a riot at Paris (which seems to have been grossly
exaggerated by some of the English papers),1 excited chiefly by the
chiffonniers, or rag-pickers. This is an unfortunate class of men, more
numerous than the nature of their occupation might have led us to
expect, who gain their living by going with lanterns at night and
picking up such rags as are to be found in the sweepings which are
thrown out of the houses in the evening and carried away by the
scavengers before morning. A new system which has been adopted, it
seems, for cleaning the streets, threatened to deprive all or some of
these poor creatures of their miserable livelihood; and this, together
with some absurd misconceptions by the populace of Paris concerning the
cholera and the sanitary measures of the civic authorities, gave rise to
the disturbances.

The Bill for the amendment of the Corn Laws has passed the Chamber of
Deputies, having first been mulcted of all its valuable provisions,
except that which puts an end to absolute prohibition.2 Importation will
in no case hereafter be prohibited, but only subjected to duties
tantamount to a prohibition. This proves that on the great questions of
commercial legislation, the Périer ministry, though not coming up to
several of the leading members of the Opposition, is far ahead of the
great bulk of either party. It is most unfortunate that the secret
voting, so mischievously established by the regulations of the Chamber,3
prevents the disclosure of the names of the Deputies composing the
majority and minority. Were these published, France would see who among
the clamorous advocates of democratic principles are the real friends of
the people, and who are merely disappointed aspirants for place.

The bill for the re-establishment of divorce, which had passed the
Chamber of Deputies almost unanimously, has been thrown out, by a large
majority, in the Chamber of Peers.4 Every day now widens the breach
between the two Edition: current; Page: [440] Chambers. Nothing else was
to be expected without an entire recomposition, as the French would say,
of the personnel of the Second Chamber.

For the entry in Mill’s bibliography, see No. 116. The item, headed
“London, April 15, 1832,” is listed as “Article on France” in the
Somerville College set, where brackets surround all but the first
paragraph1 (before which a bracket has been erased).

the cholera has thus already carried off more than twice as many persons
at Paris as have perished by it in London since its commencement. In one
day the number of new cases amounted to 1024. We have abundant reason to
rejoice that the disease broke out first in our own country. If it were
yet to come, no one can think without horror of the alarm which would
have been spread by these accounts of its ravages at Paris.

So little is known of the nature of this disease, that it is impossible
to pronounce certainly why it has proved peculiarly fatal at Paris,
peculiarly mild in London, and all over Great Britain. But we may
suspect that the thin and low diet of the working classes at Paris,
aggravated by long slackness of employment, has co-operated with their
crowded mode of life, and with the bad draining and cleansing of the
streets, to generate a predisposition to disease. No one who has ever
passed through (to have lived there is impossible) certain quarters of
Paris, seldom visited by foreigners—the Marais for example, eastward
from the Rue St. Denis—can be astonished that such places should be foci
of pestilential maladies.

The most absurd rumours were set afloat in the first few days after the
irruption of the disease. Its symptoms were believed to be the result of
poisoned provisions; and there seems to be little doubt that some
individuals, whether madmen or worse, pretended to put, or did really
put, into articles of food and drink, drugs of some kind, but not
poison. However, the usual readiness of the French to suspect the most
horrible crimes, on less evidence than would be required to make out the
most trivial fact, has displayed itself, with even more Edition:
current; Page: [441] than its wonted force. No less than five persons
were massacred in the streets on suspicion of being poisoners.

The guilt of the murders rests with their perpetrators; but the reproach
of credulity rests not with the populace alone. A proclamation by the
Prefect of Police,2 which was placarded in the streets afforded so much
countenance to the absurd and odious suspicions, that some of the
newspapers would not make themselves parties to its probable
consequences by inserting it in their columns.

The progress of the disease, which is not sparing the higher classes,
and of which M. Périer himself is said to be even now lying ill, is
wonderfully accelerating the proceedings of the Chamber of Deputies.
Laws are now hurried through with an indecent precipitation, which
prevents any resistance to the will of the ministers, except, indeed,
where they meditate some real improvement. They had introduced a bill
for reducing the enormous bounties on French fisheries;3 a considerable
step towards a system of free and equal law, bribing no one branch of
industry at the expense of other branches: but this law has not passed
without suffering considerable mutilation, at the instance of the
deputies for the maritime towns.

The whole of the estimates have been passed,4 and the Chamber is now
debating on the Ways and Means.5 This debate, which will necessarily
involve all the great questions of taxation, would, probably, have been
long and interesting at any other time, but, under present
circumstances, it is likely to be summary and insignificant.

We have now, at length, an authentic account of the events at Grenoble.6
The mayor of the town has made a long report to Government, more deeply
inculpatory of the authorities than even the enemies of the Ministry had
previously surmised. To this report all the members of the Municipal
Council have given in their adhesion, except one,7 who abstains on the
ground, that, as chief judge of the Cour Royale, he will have to
pronounce judicially on the transaction.—We shall return to this subject
hereafter.8

158.: COMPARISON OF THE TENDENCIES OF FRENCH AND ENGLISH INTELLECT
 MONTHLY REPOSITORY, N.S. VII (NOV. 1833), PP. 800-4

This letter was sent to Charles Duveyrier for insertion in the
Saint-Simonian newspaper Le Globe, where it appeared on 18 Apr., 1832,
two days before Le Globe ceased publication. The letter witnesses to
Mill’s continued friendship with the Saint-Simonians, who shared his
interest in the formation of character and the influence of circumstance
on national traits. That Mill’s letter was originally written in English
is made clear in a letter to D’Eichthal and Duveyrier: “It was very well
translated, though with some omissions & abbreviations which made it
rather more St Simonian than I intended” (EL, CW, Vol. XII, p. 109).
Since the translation is not by Mill, it is given here as App. B. This
English version of the letter, published in the Monthly Repository a
year and a half later, is there headed as title. The added introductory
paragraph (probably by Mill), explains the circumstances, as do the two
entries in his bibliography. The first reads: “A letter to Charles
Duveyrier, intended as introductory to a series of letters to the Editor
of Le Globe, the S. Simonian paper at Paris. This was translated garbled
in some passages and published in ‘Le Globe’ of 18th April 1832. The
stoppage of the paper prevented any continuation. The English original
of this letter with an introductory paragraph appeared in the Monthly
Repository for November 1833, headed Comparison of the Tendencies of
French and English intellect.” (MacMinn, p. 20.) The second reads: “An
article headed ‘Comparison of the Tendencies of French and English
intellect’ in the Monthly Repository for November 1833, being the
[original] of my letter to [Duveyrier] published in the Globe with a new
heading” (MacMinn, p. 35). The English version contains four passages
(one of them the introductory paragraph) not included in the French;
these are identified in the variant notes, where “32” stands for Le
Globe of 18 Apr., 1832.

athe following letter appeared in a French dress, with some omissions
and alterations, about a year and a half ago, in Le Globe, the journal
of the political and religious sect of Saint-Simonians. It was intended
to be the introduction to a series of letters, principally relating to
the moral and social condition of Great Britain. In consequence of the
discontinuance of the journal to which it was addressed, the design was
never prosecuted. The original of the only letter which appeared has
been communicated to us, and as it contains remarks which, though
addressed to Frenchmen, concern Englishmen, and draws a parallel between
the intellectual biasses of the two nations, which is at least not
common-place, and is drawn (as we can certify) from nearly equal
familiarity with the literature and politics of both, we offer it to our
readers. In doing so we are requested to state, by way of apology for
its somewhat egotistical style, that (although the observation may sound
epigrammatic) the tone of French composition is naturally egotistical,
and it is hardly possible not, after much mixing with Frenchmen, to
assume the externals of egotism in discussing with them, whether orally
or in writing.a

Edition: current; Page: [443]
you ask me to correspond occasionally with the editor of the Globe on
those subjects on which an Englishman, well acquainted with your
doctrines, has more to tell of what you would desire to know than is
attainable by any Frenchman. I accept your proposal. The idea had
already occurred to myself; and the honour which you have spontaneously
tendered to me, I should probably sooner or later have solicited as a
favour to myself.

But before I commence, it is due both to myself and to those for whom
this correspondence is intended, that I should state somewhat more fully
than I have yet done, even to yourself individually, the motives and
views with which I undertake it. I do so the more readily, as this is in
itself no unimportant element of that knowledge which you have done me
the honour to suppose that the readers of the Globe may be able to
derive from my letters. To a St. Simonian who desires to know England,
it cannot be indifferent to learn what are the inducements which may
lead an Englishman, himself no St. Simonian, and agreeing with the St.
Simonians though partially on almost all points, entirely perhaps on
none, to place himself in communication with the St. Simonian Society.

You will imagine, perhaps, that the motive is a desire to do my part
towards what you are labouring for with so much success, namely, to
enable two nations, each of which possesses so many of the elements of
greatness and goodness, but developed in an unequal degree, to
understand each other; to make them do justice mutually to each other’s
merits, and acquiesce in the necessary results of those laws of human
and of external nature which have made the characters of the two nations
different, and in so doing have marked out to each of them a different
vocation, and commanded each to pursue the end of our common existence
by separate, yet not by opposite, roads. An arrangement which, viewing
it as St. Simonians, you cannot but regard as providential. Viewed in
any way in which it can be looked at by an enlarged intellect, and a
soul aspiring to indefinite improvement, it is a subject of rejoicing;
for it furnishes the philosopher with varied experiments on the
education of the human race; and affords the only mode by which all the
parts of our nature are enabled to move forward at once, none of them
being choked (as some must be in every attempt to reduce all characters
to a single invariable type) by the disproportionate growth of the
remainder.

You are not wrong in supposing that I have this object deeply at heart,
and that the earnestness with which you on your part pursue it, is not
the weakest of the ties of sympathy which connect me and you. I am
sensible, moreover, that at the point of view at which you are placed,
this must be the principal source of any expectation of good which you
can entertain from my correspondence. But such is not the only, nor even
the principal, of the motives which induce me to choose Edition:
current; Page: [444] the Globe as a vehicle (so far as your permission
extends) of many of my feelings and opinions. There is a stronger still;
it is, that among the readers of that journal I find a public capable of
understanding those opinions, of entering into those feelings; and in
the members of your society, a body of thinkers and writers with whom I
think it may be of use publicly to discuss them.

It is not necessary for any one to remind you, that the St. Simonians
are, just now, the only association of public writers existing in the
world who systematically stir up from the foundation all the great
social questions; even those which have been settled long ago upon a
footing which revolution has not yet completely carried away; even those
on which the ancient doctrines, howsoever they may have declined in
their practical efficacy, have not yet ceased to be speculatively
acknowledged by every one. You declare that all social questions must
receive a new solution; and while you propound with that view the best
ideas you have, you call upon all who are capable to do the same, and
are yourselves willing to hear and desirous to understand all men.

If even in France to have done this has exposed you to the
misinterpretation and the odium of which you are the objects, it is more
utterly impossible than you yourselves are as yet able fully to
understand, that any set of public writers should for a long time to
come stand up openly in England and do the like. In England there is no
scope at present for general theories; unless, indeed, they be
generalizations of such narrow views as make no call even upon the most
uncultivated mind to look beyond its own miserably contracted horizon.

M. Michel Chevalier has frequently propounded in the Globe, the doctrine
that Germany excels all nations in science and intellect, England in
industry, France (as having the most widely-spread sympathies) in
morality.1 bThis was doubtless intended merely as a general indication,
not to be taken literally, but with many explanations and modifications;
some of which you are, I know, aware of, and I may have opportunity of
suggesting others in the course of this correspondence. What I am now
going to mention is, however, literally true, and is, I think, the
principal truth contained in M. Chevalier’s remark.b It is, that the
German nation is eminently speculative, the English essentially
practical, and the French endeavour to unite both qualities, having an
equal turn for framing general theories and for reducing them into
cpractice. As far as this goes, the palm of intellectual superiority,
you see, belongs to France, and not to Germany. Considered in other
points of view, I could prove that it belongs to England. In short, I
conceive it might be shown that every one of the three nations possesses
some intellectual and some moral qualities in a higher state of
development than Edition: current; Page: [445] either of the two other
nations; and that each excels in some department, even of industry;
witness the woollens of Saxony, and the well-known superiority of your
country in almost all fancy articles.

But this is not the point I intended to enlarge upon just at present.
What I meant to say was, that ifc any person has ideas which he thinks
important to propound to the public of Germany, it is a positive
recommendation to them that they are brought forward as part of a
systematic theory, founded on a combined view of history, and on a
general conception of philosophy, literature, and the arts. This would
perfectly chime in with the tendency of the German mind. Views very
extensive, and therefore, of necessity, promising only a gradual and
distant realization, have a better chance of being listened to in that
country, than those of a narrower kind. Even in France, though the
general and systematic character of any opinions are no recommendation
to the public attention, neither are they a positive hinderance. But in
England they are so.

The extremely practical character of the English people, that which
makes them, as men of business and industriels excel all the nations of
Europe, has also the effect of making them very inattentive to any thing
that cannot be carried instantly into practice. The English people have
never had their political feelings called out by abstractions. They have
fought for particular laws, but never for a principle of legislation.
The doctrines of the sovereignty of the people, and the rights of man,
never had any root in this country. The cry was always for a particular
change in the mode of electing members of the House of Commons; for
making an act of parliament to meet some immediate exigency; or for
taking off some particular tax. The English public think nobody worth
listening to, except in so far as he tells them of something to be done,
and not only that, but of something which can be done immediately. What
is more, the only reasons they will generally attend to, are those
founded on the specific good consequences to be expected from the
adoption of the specific proposition.

Whoever, therefore, wishes to produce much immediate effect upon the
English public, must bring forward every idea upon its own independent
grounds, and must, I was going to say, take pains to conceal that it is
connected with any ulterior views. If his readers or his audience
suspected that it was part of a system, they would conclude that his
support even of the specific proposition, was not founded on any opinion
he had that it was good in itself, but solely on its being connected
with Utopian schemes, or at any rate with principles which they are “not
prepared” (a truly English expression) to give their assent to.

To you, who know that politics are an essentially progressive science,
and that none of the great questions of social organization can receive
their true answer, except by being considered in connexion with views
which ascend high into the past, and stretch far into the future; it is
scarcely necessary to point out that any person, who thinks as you do on
this point, must have much to say, which cannot with advantage be said,
just at present, to the people of England. In writing to Edition:
current; Page: [446] persuade the English, one must tell them only of
the next step they have to take, keeping back all mention of any
subsequent step. Whatever we may have to propose, we must contract our
reasoning into the most confined limits; we must place the expediency of
the particular measure upon the narrowest grounds on which it can rest;
and endeavour to let out no more of general truth, than exactly as much
as is absolutely indispensable to make out our particular conclusion.

Now, as the people of England will be treated in this manner, they must:
and those who write for them, must write in the manner best calculated
to make an impression upon their minds. When, therefore, I see, that
parliament ought to enact a certain law to-day or to-morrow, and that it
is my duty to exert myself for that purpose, I will state to the English
people such immediate advantages as appear to me likely to result from
the measure:—but when I wish to carry discussion into the field of
science and philosophy, to state any general principles of politics, or
propound doubts tending to put other people upon stating general
principles for my instruction, I must go where I find readers capable of
understanding and relishing such inquiries, and writers capable of
taking part in them.

I come to you as littérateurs and artists come to Europe from that
country of pure industrialism, the United States of America; because
there is no call in their own country for the kind of labour which is
their vocation. I conceive that, in political philosophy, the initiative
belongs to France at this moment; not so much from the number of truths
which have yet been practically arrived at, but rather from the far more
elevated terrain on which the discussion is engaged; a terrain from
which England is still separated by the whole interval which lies
between 1789 and 1832. Every one, therefore, who can contribute any
thing towards the elaboration of political principles, should carry his
ideas, such as they are, to France, and if to France, to none rather
than to you, who are in so many respects the furthest advanced of all
persons in France at the present moment.

I have yet another reason for placing myself in communication with the
readers of the Globe. Englishman as I am, I understand them better than
I do almost any class of my own countrymen. The cause is, that you have
determinate views on all the subjects most interesting to mankind; and
you keep none of these back, but state them to the public on every
fitting occasion. In England, on the contrary, whatever may be a man’s
opinions, he never brings any of them before the general public, except
those which are naturally suggested by the topics of the day; the rest
he keeps to himself, or reserves for philosophical works. You can never
tell what sort of persons those are who read the Times, or the Morning
Chronicle, or the Edinburgh Review, or the Quarterly Review; except that
you can in some measure guess whether they are Tories, Whigs, or
radicals; even in this, your guess is often wrong, and at the best, how
little this discloses of all that constitutes a man’s real belief (if he
have any) or the real furniture of his mind, no one knows better than
yourselves. But whoever reads Le Globe, tells you by Edition: current;
Page: [447] that alone, an immense deal of his character and modes of
thinking. And I, who have long read it assiduously, as well as almost
every other publication which has proceeded from your society, may say
that I now know the opinions of the St. Simonians, understand their
language, desire to hear more of it on all subjects, and know in what
manner my own ideas must be expressed, to find readiest access to their
minds. I cannot say so much of any body of English readers, to whom I
could address myself.

To these reasons for corresponding with you, permit me to add one, which
needed not to be backed by any others in order to render it
sufficient;—the high admiration which it is impossible for me not to
entertain for you, your purposes, and your proceedings. When I see men
doing all that the St. Simonians do, and sacrificing all that they
sacrifice, for a doctrine which has as much truth in it as theirs has,
and which, though I am unable to adopt it, must, in my opinion, do
infinitely more good by its good, than it can do evil by its evil; when
I see this, it is enough for me that such men think I can be of any use
to them, to induce me eagerly to obey their call, as far as is
consistent with what I owe to my own views of truth, and to the superior
claims of my own country upon my labours and sacrifices.

dThis seems to be fully as suitable a termination to my letter as any
formule of politeness, and with this, therefore, I will for the present
conclude.d


159.: LEWIS’S REMARKS ON THE USE AND ABUSE OF POLITICAL TERMS
 EXAMINER, 22 APR., 1832, PP. 259-60

Mill reviewed this work at greater length in Tait’s Edinburgh Magazine
for May 1832 (see CW, Vol. XVIII, pp. 1-13). On 29 May, 1832, outlining
for Thomas Carlyle his recent activities, Mill evaluates his writings in
the Examiner on France, his review of Smart, Nos. 151 and 153 (by
implication), and his two reviews of Lewis: “On the whole, the opinions
I have put forth in these different articles are, I think, rather not
inconsistent with yours, than exactly corresponding to them; & are
expressed so coldly and unimpressively that I can scarcely bear to look
back on such poor stuff. I have not yet come up even with my friends the
St. Simonians; & it would be saying very little even if I had.” (EL, CW,
Vol. XII, p. 105. Cf. the concluding sentence of the introductory
paragraph of No. 158.) This review, the first in the “Literary
Examiner,” is headed “Remarks on the Use and Abuse of some Political
Terms. By George Cornewall Lewis, Esq., Student of Christ Church,
Oxford. [London: Fellowes, 1832.]” The item is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “A review of Geo. Cornewall Lewis’s Remarks on the Use
and Abuse of certain political terms. In the Examiner of 22d April
1832.” (MacMinn, p. 20.) It is listed as “Review of Geo. Cornewall
Lewis’s ‘Use and Abuse of Political Terms’ ” and enclosed in square
brackets in the Somerville College set of the Examiner, with one
correction: at 450.33 “to other” is altered to “to draw other”. One
passage of the Edition: current; Page: [448] “poor stuff” was deemed
worthy of quotation in A System of Logic; in the variants resulting from
its collation, “L” signifies A System of Logic.

mr. lewis is already known as one of the accomplished translators of
Müller’s Dorians, and Böckh’s Public Economy of Athens;1 but, with the
exception of a little tract on Logic, of considerable merit, published a
few years ago,2 he now appears (we believe) for the first time before
the public as the author of an original work.

The nature and purpose of the book are accurately enough expressed by
its title. Such works are the natural results of the call which is now
making itself heard, for stricter and more precise thinking on political
topics. Whoever is au courant of the great intellectual movement of the
age, is aware that the scientific study of politics as a branch of
philosophy, (though scarcely half a century old), is now the chief and
engrossing occupation of thinking and instructed minds throughout
Europe: whether as embodied in the speculations of Mr. Bentham and his
successors; in the labours of the French and English economists; or in
the attempts which have been made with various success in France and
Germany (from Herder and Johannes Müller3 down to Guizot and
Saint-Simon), to philosophize upon the facts of history considered as a
connected whole, governed by determinate and assignable laws. In
England, (where the hindmost minds remain longer ignorant than in any
other reading nation, of what is doing by the foremost) the bare idea
that such studies exist, for any purpose which a sensible man can attach
value to, has only within this last year or two, if at all, been
diffused and popularized. Yet even in England all minds are now turned
to politics, if not as yet with great comprehensiveness of views, at
least with the certainty of great results, for good or for evil. And
though the questions immediately at issue are likely to be decided by
more summary methods than those of logic, yet on a subject on which the
magnitude of the interests at stake forces all to think after some
manner, such as have any capacity for philosophy will endeavour to think
philosophically, and to contribute what lies in their power towards
enabling as many others as are so disposed to do the like; of which this
work of Mr. Lewis is an example.

It is a highly creditable production; less however in itself, than as an
earnest of better things to come. Were it to be considered as the
ultimatum of a completed Edition: current; Page: [449] and ripened mind,
we should have nearly as much to say of it for ill as for good. But
there is no other ill in it than that of not being good enough; the most
hopeless of all faults in a mind which has attained maturity, the most
excusable in one which is in a state of adolescence. Every thing in the
book which is justly liable to objection, proves merely that Mr. Lewis
has begun to think and to inquire, and has yet only partially realized
any result from his thinking and inquiring. It is already no little
matter to have fairly and in singleness of purpose set about the
task:—above all, when we consider of how many voluminous and even
popular writers and instructors it may be said, that they have never,
properly speaking, thought at all; that to have had a thought of their
own, or even to have made a thought completely their own which was
originally another man’s, is an event in their lives which is yet to
come, and which, if it ever should come, would most certainly effect an
entire change in their whole manner of existence. Mr. Lewis belongs to a
very different category; and we have far other hopes from him. Many a
mind of the highest capabilities, if it had attempted to fix upon paper
such views of things, or such views of other men’s views, as passed
through it in the middle stage of its growth, while rising from the
learner into the teacher, would have made a far less advantageous
appearance than Mr. Lewis has done. This middle stage is the most
critical period in any man’s intellectual history, and few are they who
pass through it. There is nothing in the work before us which forbids us
to believe that Mr. Lewis is destined to be one of those few; unless,
unfortunately (what sometimes happens), impressions, some of which would
naturally be evanescent, should derive from the very process of
committing them to paper, that fixity and tenacity which is frequently
given to a notion by much pondering over it.

Mr. Lewis’s purpose in this work, as a political philosopher, is to set
people right in their use of terms. An important object; yet not
all-important; and, indeed, essentially secondary in its nature, the
primary end being, to set people right in their notions of things. True
it is, that our judgments of things are frequently vitiated by fallacies
which creep in by means of words; but this is only the common case of an
effect reacting upon its cause, since an illogical use of words also
still more frequently arises from an imperfect conception of the nature
and properties of the things which these words are employed to
designate. Almost all the faults of this book may be traced, we think,
to the attempt to treat one of these two classes of errors independently
of the other. aFew people have reflected how great a knowledge of
bthingsb is required to enable a man to affirm that any given argument
turns wholly upon words. There is, perhaps, not one of the leading terms
of philosophy which is not used in almost innumerable shades of meaning,
to express ideas more or less widely different from one another.
Edition: current; Page: [450] Between two of these ideas a sagacious and
penetrating mind will discern, as it were intuitively, an unobvious link
of connection, upon which, though perhaps unable to give a logical
account of it, he will found a perfectly valid argument, which his
critic, not having so keen an insight into the cthingsc, will mistake
for a fallacy turning on the double meaning of a term. And the greater
the genius of him who thus safely leaps over the chasm, the greater will
probably be the crowing and vain-glory of the mere logician, who,
hobbling after him, evinces his own superior wisdom by pausing on its
brink, and giving up as desperate his proper business of bridging it
over.a

When it shall be deemed as essential to the character of a logician to
be able to recognise the substance of sound reasoning, howsoever
overshadowed, as to detect irregularities in the form; it will be
acknowledged, that in order to sit in judgment upon any man’s
philosophical phraseology, it is often necessary to be more thoroughly
master of his ideas than he is himself.

But if there needs all this knowledge, not of words but of things, to
ascertain whether one man has preserved sufficient clearness and
consistency in the use of language, never to make a stumbling-block to
himself of his own terminology; how much more of such knowledge does it
require to determine what meanings can be annexed to what words, most
conveniently for the general purposes of philosophy! Language to a
philosopher is like an army to a general-in-chief; like that, too, it is
often all too scanty for the work it has to do. To judge what positions
must be occupied, and what may be left unguarded; to make the most
advantageous disposition of a small force for the defence of an
extensive territory,—requires the most familiar knowledge and careful
study of the localities. To give the law to philosophical nomenclature,
requires the most intimate acquaintance with the strong and the weak
points of philosophy and of general opinion; so as to know where on one
quarter a fallacy creeps in, because the most common name of an object
suggests a part only of its essential properties, and not the whole; on
another, an all-important distinction lies unheeded for want of a short
and compact expression pointing it out:—to save words from being
engrossed, as they are apt to be, by objects or thoughts which are safe
from being overlooked by their own obviousness; and afford the aid of
language to draw other less palpable and familiar (though possibly more
important) combinations of ideas out of obscurity.

Yet we blame no one, if, in the present state of the human mind, he
begins to be a critic in words, before he is adequately conversant with
the things which they signify. The greatest intellects, in our time,
have had scarcely any other beginnings.

Quintilian remarks, that in a youthful production, redundancy of
invention and exuberance of fancy are faults which the teacher should
see not merely with Edition: current; Page: [451] indulgence, but with
pleasure; since every year of experience and culture helps to cure
defects of judgment, but the imagination which is not overflowing in
youth, will surely be jejune and scanty in maturer years.4 In our own
times Quintilian’s observation must give place to its exact opposite.
Circumstances for which no individual can with justice be held
responsible, have reversed the order in which the capabilities of the
youthful intellect successively unfold themselves. What even the best
minds of our day are remarkable for in the outset, is seldom fertility
and fulness, but the forced and premature predominance of the faculty of
judgment, or rather, of judging; exercised, be it well understood, not
upon their own stores, but upon other people’s. What remains to be
accomplished by subsequent culture is nowise to root out weeds, and
prune luxuriant growth, but rather to plant anything in the mind, which
else would remain almost a waste. The first lesson, that which men begin
by teaching themselves, is not to do anything, great or little, but to
perceive that other people have not done it. Some imperfect faculty of
criticism is what men first attain to. Imperfect it must necessarily be,
for none know really what is false but he who knows also what is true:
the knowledge of good and of evil are fruits which grow upon the same
tree. Accordingly the criticism generally addresses itself not to the
substance of what is taught, but chiefly to the qualifications of the
teacher. Criticising in our time is mostly confutation only of the man,
not of what he delivers as his opinion: it ends not in throwing any new
light upon the subject treated of, but in shewing that some man who is
undertaking to treat of it, is inconsistent, or puzzle-headed, and is
incapable of giving instruction upon the matter to any one, or at least
has not succeeded in giving any to the critic. It is scarcely necessary
to add, that even the man, in this mode of proceeding, seldom meets with
fair play; for when the presumption set out with is that every man, even
though he be a great man, is at least as likely to be wrong as right,
what more natural than to conclude that he is talking without a meaning,
rather than take any considerable trouble to make out what his meaning
is? The critic squares his author’s understanding by his own; and if the
two do not exactly fit, with whom is it more natural to suppose the
fault to lie—his author, or himself?

All this must be; or, at least, in an age of transition like the
present, will be; which is all that in such a case can be meant by must.
Numbers of persons who make considerable noise in the world, never
emerge from the state of mind above described. Even the best must
generally pass through such a state, but rapidly, and without
exemplifying any of its more baneful consequences.

Mr. Lewis has begun where it is scarcely possible, just at present, even
for the most vigorous minds, not to begin: he has obtained some insight,
not into the truth, but into the deficiencies of others in seeking for
it, or in setting it forth. Edition: current; Page: [452] And if amidst
many sound and valuable criticisms on the established usage of language,
and on the phraseology of particular writers, he occasionally condemns
what he has not seen to the bottom of, and for want of sufficient
familiarity with an author’s ideas, does not see correctly what that
author means by his words; if at other times he is almost captious in
refusing to writers the use of, perhaps, the only familiar terms which
the language affords them to express their meaning, because he has laid
hold of those terms to mark distinctions of his own, the importance of
which he more clearly sees; all this is but the almost necessary
consequence of attempting to settle the language of a science before
mankind have agreed about the science itself. Instead of blaming Mr.
Lewis because his work contains such blemishes, we will rather give him
all praise that it consists of anything else; and will exhort him to
persevere in his attempt to reform philosophical language, but to
remember that such reform cannot proceed faster than the reform of the
doctrines of philosophy; that the two must go hand in hand, and that it
is as impossible to use language precisely while ideas are uncertain and
confused, as it is for ideas to remain clear without a nomenclature
suitable for the accurate expression of them.

the printer’s rule) enclosed in square brackets.

the french chamber of deputies has galloped through the Ways and Means,
disposed of all the great questions of taxation with scarcely a word of
discussion, and then virtually adjourned, it being now impossible to
make a house.1 It must be remembered that by the regulations of the
French Parliament, the number necessary to form a quorum is not forty
members, as with us, but a majority of the whole house.2 This is one of
the causes which practically disable the Chamber from transacting public
business after dinner time.

The Session will not close for some days, the Peers having yet to pass
several bills already adopted by the other Chamber.

the french chambers were prorogued on the 21st of April, after a session
of nine months, in which but little that is of any real use has been
even talked about; and of that little, nothing but the most paltry and
insignificant fraction has been accomplished. The first session of the
first Parliament elected under the Citizen King and the charte-vérité,1
has demonstrated nothing but the vices of the institutions of France,
and the backwardness of her national mind.

In our next paper, we purpose giving a summary of the res gestae of the
session; with the remarks, which such a survey naturally suggests, on
the two comprehensive questions—what France now is, and what she has
next to do and to become?

The illness of MM. Périer and d’Argout has set much vain speculation
afloat concerning the chances of a change of ministry.


162.: THE CLOSE OF THE SESSION IN FRANCE
 EXAMINER, 6 MAY, 1832, PP. 291-2

This comment on the background and meaning of the legislative session,
with its companion article, No. 172, employs a genre later used by Mill
for British sessions (see CW, Vol. VI). The article, headed as title, is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “An article headed ‘Close of the
Session’ in the Examiner of 6th May 1832” (MacMinn, p. 21). In the
Somerville College set of the Examiner it is listed as “The Close of the
Session in France” and enclosed in square brackets; at 455.11 “ong” in
“longer” is inked over, but no obvious correction can be inferred.

when the french chambers met, after the general election in June 1831,
the situation of France and of the French Government presented many
features of resemblance with the position of affairs at the opening of
the States General in 1789.

There was not, indeed, as at the former period, an accumulated pile of
the abominations of centuries, to be carted off and flung into the
bottomless pit. The Edition: current; Page: [454] extirpation of evil
had ceased to be the first and greatest good; the destroying angel had
done his work, and a gentler and more beneficent spirit must henceforth
preside over the accomplishment of the milder task which remained.
Neither had the men of 1831, like the far greater men of 1789, to
construct a Government, from the foundation upwards. There was a
Government: in a degree more or less perfect, it was, and could keep
itself, obeyed; and had therefore full leisure to look about it and
think of deserving to be so. What is called a Constitution, too, that
is, the bare walls and rafters and doorways, the mere carcass of the
social edifice, had been bequeathed to the new French Legislature by its
immediate predecessors. What is deemed the great question of Government,
the question who shall govern, (not how), had been provisionally
decided, by those who had accidentally found the sceptre lying at their
feet, when it fell from the incapable hands of its former holders. The
workman had got his new tools, and fit was it that he should try how he
could work with them, ere he flung them away and looked out again for
another set. To this extent, therefore, the position of the French
Chambers differed from that of the Constituent Assembly; and was a far
easier one. But in other respects the two were strikingly analogous.

In both, the sense of the whole nation, or of that part of it which the
law presumed to be the fit guide and guardian of the remainder, had been
appealed to; in the one case, after the happening of a revolution; in
the other, under circumstances which were in themselves a revolution. In
both, a call had been made upon the people to choose out all their best
and wisest men, and send these to assemble in one place and consider
what could be done to make the condition of the French Nation better.
Both bodies were invited by the circumstances under which they were
called together, to review all the institutions and the general
political condition of their country. Both assembled at the opening of a
new era; and on the will of each it mainly depended, what, in the first
instance, the character of that era should be.

But the two bodies were very differently fitted, by talents and
acquirements, for the task which lay before them.

The Constituent Assembly, with all their faults, were the élite of
France. There was scarcely a man in the kingdom who had given public
proof of integrity and abilities to the nation, or to his own province
or district, who did not find a place in that illustrious body. The
ruling spirits were inexperienced, which was not their fault; they were
also vain and presumptuous, which was. But they were, almost to a man,
persons whose talents would in any sphere of life have made them
conspicuous; well versed in the best studies and the most valuable ideas
of their age. If any one doubts this, he does not know them; he has not
read, or has not understood, their speeches and writings. It is true,
such culture as their age afforded had possessed the most of them
thoroughly and deep-rootedly, with little besides this, that Evil was
Evil. That it was possible to extinguish the Evil Edition: current;
Page: [455] and yet miss the Good, was a lesson which they had not
learned, but which their best and bravest were destined to leave to
posterity written in their blood. Yet they warred against evil with an
undaunted spirit, and did unflinchingly and effectually the great work
of their own time.

The work of our time requires far greater men, and is likely, for all we
can perceive, to devolve upon far smaller.

It is a very simple matter, if we will but consider it, to see when
things as they are, are wrong: the signs of a vicious constitution of
society glare obviously upon us: though men who have slept over their
evils for centuries, are apt to think that they have accomplished
something mirific, because, when their eyes are no longer shut, they can
see. But to know the essentials of a healthy state of society, and what
it is in the power of a government to do towards realizing these, is
quite another affair. Whatever requires only that we shall see what now
is, many may accomplish; but to conceive and foresee things yet to come,
the results which will ensue hereafter from our actions now, so as to be
able to translate a mere opinion that things go wrong, into a practical
effort of any profitable kind to make them go right—is a faculty given
in any high degree to very few, and which even in its lower degrees,
seems to be but sparingly possessed by the present generation of public
men in France. There is but little of it in the nation; and the
legislature represents most imperfectly even that little.

For sixteen years previous to the Revolution in 1830, France had enjoyed
a practically free press, and an approach to a representative
constitution. During this period, the minds of her youth, absorbed as
they have even morbidly been in political speculation and discussion,
might have been expected to make some advances in political knowledge;
for, in the absence, there as elsewhere, of any systematic instruction
on such subjects, it is to the collision of opinions on the questions
which practically arise, that mankind are indebted for such faint light
as they anywhere see, and guide themselves by. But this improvement, the
peculiar character of the battle which French patriotism had then to
fight, in a great measure forbade. The contest for good Government,
under the Restoration, was essentially conservative. The legitimists and
divine-right men were then the innovators. The Liberal party were
struggling, not to acquire further good, but to hold fast that which
they had, against ever-repeated efforts, both open and covert, to take
it from them. Consequently, by a strange and unhappy fortune, although
the cause of Representative Government against feudal monarchy seemed
finally won, and had been followed up even to judgment and execution, it
was yet kept open for a perpetual rehearing, and no new cause was ever
called on. Still the endless, and then and there almost profitless,
dispute about the mere instrument of Government, occupied all tongues
and all minds, to the exclusion of every thought about Government
itself: to say nothing of the still greater problem, in what fashion
man, well governed or not, is called upon to conduct himself in this
world. Any question which seemed to have no immediate bearing Edition:
current; Page: [456] on that preliminary one, “The Charter, or the
ancien régime,” was all but overlooked. The natural consequence
followed. While patriotism was busily and noisily engaged in defending
the mere external rampart of French legislation, the watchful eye and
quiet hand of private interest were ever at work moulding the whole
interior of the structure to its purposes. It was in the years of
fiercest anti-Bourbonism, that the most systematic and all-comprehensive
system of commercial monopoly under the name of protection, which the
world has seen for centuries, was silently organized and brought to
perfection. And how much of the public mind was taken up with this,
during the process? About as much as was bestowed upon the dismissal of
a single public officer, for having voted against orders at an
election.1 During the same period, the roads of France, which Napoleon
left in good order, were allowed (the public voice remaining nearly
silent) to fall into such a state of dilapidation, and the canals to
remain so heavily taxed, that except near the great rivers or the sea,
France could produce little either in agriculture or manufactures, save
what could be consumed on or near the spot where it was called into
existence. No one asked why France, for her extent and population, had
neither internal nor foreign commerce deserving of the name. If even the
almost total extinction of the Lancasterian schools made any noise
during its progressive accomplishment, the cause was chiefly, that, in
the minds of the Liberals, it was inseparably connected with Jesuitism
and the Camarilla.2

We mention not these things for censure, but for the light they throw on
what France at present is. We may well lament, not indeed that France,
but that man, can seldom think earnestly on more than one thing at a
time. But when the sole and indispensable instrument of all other
political good, freedom of thought and of utterance, and its
accompaniments, exemption from the iron yoke of a caste-oligarchy over
the body, and of a retrograde priesthood over the soul, when these were
possessions which, while they seemed irrevocably gained, did not the
less require to be perennially battled for with all the energy of
manhood; it must even be set down to the mere infirmity of our nature,
that the French, in the engrossing interest of the contest for a form of
government, found little leisure to think of those things for which
forms of government were intended.

During the short respite which the Martignac Ministry afforded, (a truce
which it was hoped might be the preliminary of a lasting peace), the
minds of the French youth eagerly turned from thinking only of the
tools, to think of the work itself; and a strong tendency to the study
of the details of government, with a view to substantial improvements,
was beginning to impress itself on the national Edition: current; Page:
[457] mind. The accession of the Polignac ministry brought this march of
improvement to a dead halt. And then came the Revolution of July: the
greatest advance which any nation perhaps ever made by a single step—an
advance which no one expected, and for which no one’s habits and ideas
were prepared—a change which gave the French nation a clear field to
build on, before they had possessed themselves of the materials to build
withal; a leap, which cleared in an instant a space of many years
journey; and transported France through mid-air, away from the scenes
with which she was familiar, into regions unvisited and unknown.

Nothing worse has ensued than ought to have been expected. The
peculiarities of the French character render public opinion (when such
really exists) in that country more even than elsewhere, all but
irresistible: but there has been no public opinion since the Revolution
of July; only public discontent and irritation, and a voice perpetually
crying out “Do something,” but not telling what to do, not having any
thing to tell. On one point, and no more, since the accession of Louis
Philippe, has there been in France a public opinion: this was the
Hereditary Peerage:3 and on this, accordingly, the Government, though
with the worst grace in the world, yielded: it had no choice: and it
will yield every thing which shall hereafter be demanded with like
energy of conviction by the French people; but, unfortunately, the
French people have not yet known what else to ask; their time, however,
is coming.

Men have not always convictions, but they have always interests: with
difficulty enough controlled even by the firmest convictions, but
paramount and omnipotent wheresoever there are none. Accordingly, the
most remarkable feature in the French literature of the day, whether
books or newspapers, is the unceasing complaint proceeding from every
earnest mind, that there is no faith, no strong persuasion of any kind;
an all-pervading scepticism; nobody feeling sufficiently certain of what
he calls his opinion, to be willing to part with five pounds because of
its truth; and even the men from whom such conduct was least to be
expected, sacrificing what seemed their most cherished principles of
action for place or favour. Yet these are probably not bad men, nor
incapable, even yet, of sacrifices for conscience sake. They have simply
nothing for which their conscience commands them any sacrifice. The
plain fact is, man doubts of every thing else, but feels perfectly
certain that he has a stomach; for amidst all the changes of religious,
moral, and political creeds, and even during the interval betwixt one
creed and another, these truths remain eternally recognizable—that man
lives by bread, and that sugar is pleasant to the palate.

In all this, France is neither worse, nor worse off, than other
countries; she has only got forward into another phasis of the change
which all Europe is passing through, and of which we ourselves are in
the earlier stages, but which, we may trust, is destined to be softened
to us by the example of our predecessors. The Edition: current; Page:
[458] difference with us is, that more of the old house will probably be
left standing until the new one is ready: but who is to build the new
one, here any more than there? or who has arrived at any clear notion
even of the principles of its construction? Whether the resting-place in
which the mind provisionally houses herself, be an old ruin, or a
temporary shed, certain it is that she never feels herself at home in
it, but dwells in an uneasy uncertainty until Thought and Experience
have enabled her to erect for herself a permanent abode. But for this,
time is required; and it must be given.

In the meanwhile, for want of clear guiding perceptions to incite or to
restrain, such activity as is still to be met with will be the result of
passion and instinct. The young and ardent, who hope eagerly, and know
not such a feeling as self-distrust, will be impatient and angry because
nothing, or less than they expected, is done:—having, themselves, as
yet, mostly nothing to propose but this, “Let the people decide:” as if
those maxims of political wisdom which they, the friends and leaders of
the people, have hitherto failed to discover in their own heads, were to
be brought to light of a sudden through some magical incantation by
means of balls in a balloting-box. On the other hand, the old and timid,
but especially the class possessed of property, will be palsied by a
nervous dread of innovation. They who have aught to lose—until
improvement is brought before them in a palpable shape, so that they
fancy they can see and touch all its consequences—are instinctively its
enemies; for they love not a leap in the dark, and, it must be owned, do
not trouble themselves greatly to seek for light, feeling easy in their
bodily attitude where they now are, and unhappily being apt to esteem
that the principal, or the only essential point. But by degrees, as the
thinking minds of a country throw more and more light upon question
after question, the demands of the one party become more definite and
circumspect, the terrors of the other abate, and they lend a more
willing ear to what originally appalled them; until, at length, not at
one stroke, but by a series of partial efforts, new and wiser systems of
policy are bodied forth and wrought into the people’s minds, and the
practice of the state insensibly moulded thereon.

In spite of superficial appearances, in themselves affording no
materials for right judgment, and seen besides with purblind and
jaundiced eyes by the newspaper-writers of all parties in England; the
public mind of France is already making a perceptible progress towards
this desirable consummation. Great indeed are the obstacles, and long
will it be ere they are entirely overcome: yet even now, not a day
passes without some fresh indication of the good which is silently
preparing: a sensible brightening has long indicated the commencement of
the twilight which precedes the rising of the sun. Many are the new and
practically important ideas which have for the first time been thrown
into general circulation within the last year; and along with the
increased tendency to the more directly applicable parts of the art of
government, may be plainly discerned the natural accompaniment of a more
careful study of that art—an increasing Edition: current; Page: [459]
sense of its difficulties. It is chiefly from the press, that we gather
these satisfactory indications. Such marks are not indeed wholly wanting
in the Chambers also, but are almost imperceptible, and would not,
perhaps, be detected there by any person who had not previously observed
the same tokens elsewhere. For in this, as in all else, the French
Legislature is but an indifferent representation of the good sense, the
talent, or the acquirements of the nation, or of anything else therein
which deserves to be represented. The proofs that it is so, deduced from
the history of its last session, and the reasons why it must be so,
drawn from its own constitution, we shall next lay before our readers.
Be this, however, the work of a separate, and a future article.4


163.: PROPERTY IN LAND
 EXAMINER, 6 MAY, 1832, P. 295

This unheaded paragraph (in square brackets, here removed) is appended
to a long letter to the editor, headed “Westminster Review—Landlords’
Claims,” in which “A Claimant of Justice” objects to a passage on p. 306
of “Saint-Simonianism, &c.,” Westminster Review, XVI (Apr. 1832),
279-321, by Thomas Perronet Thompson (1783-1869), Radical writer and
proprietor of the review. It is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A
paragraph in the same paper [as No. 162], on Property in Land, in answer
to a Correspondent” (MacMinn, p. 21). In the Somerville College set of
the Examiner, it is listed as “Paragraph on Property in Land, in reply
to a correspondent” and enclosed in a second set of square brackets.

we agree entirely in all the doctrines of our correspondent, except the
practical conclusion which they are probably intended to suggest. We
cordially concur in the opinion that land, or any other possession or
advantage for which the first possessor is not indebted to his own
labour, but to accident or mere priority of occupation, ought to be
retained and managed for the benefit of the community generally, and not
granted away to individuals; but when it has been so appropriated,
perhaps ages ago, it would be the height of iniquity to take it away
from the possessors without full compensation. The lands of Great
Britain, or of any other ancient community, have, for the most part,
been acquired by the labour of the present owners, or of their
progenitors; having been purchased from former proprietors, in exchange
for property honestly earned by industry, and prudently accumulated by
forethought and frugality. The land, therefore, considered as property,
is just as much the produce of labour, as if it had been made with
hands. That which was given for the land was made with hands, as fairly
as any other kind of property: and the land is a mere equivalent
obtained in exchange. We are speaking only of the land as a source of
income; not of the land Edition: current; Page: [460] as a source of
mischievous power. As far as the ownership of land gives any one an
influence which it were desirable he did not possess over its
cultivation, and over the interests of its inhabitants, so far, there
would be no injustice in placing that kind of property on a different
footing. Neither would there be any injustice in buying up all the land
in the country, paying to the present proprietors its fair value. We
only contend that it would be supremely unjust to take away from any
person whatever, what the law has hitherto recognized as his property,
without a full pecuniary equivalent. Property is made an idol in
England; the sacredness of property is made a shield for every abuse; it
should be clearly understood, that the State is at liberty to modify the
general right of property as much as it likes; to new-model it
altogether, if the public interest requires it: but never to the
pecuniary injury of the present possessors, unless by a spontaneous
sacrifice on their part.

it is feared that M. Casimir Périer will not survive his present
illness, and no one seems to believe that he will recover sufficiently
to be again capable of public business. Notwithstanding this, the King
has found so much difficulty in determining on the choice of a
successor, that M. Périer still retains, nominally, the rank of
President of the Council,—in other words, of Prime Minister. There is,
therefore, no Prime Minister, that is, the King is his own Minister,—the
flattest contradiction of all the principles of a free government, since
the King, not being subject to be turned out by a change of
Administration, is Minister without any responsibility.

The place of Minister of the Interior1 has been filled up by M. de
Montalivet, who held that office under M. Laffitte. M. Girod de l’Ain
succeeds M. de Montalivet as Minister of Public Instruction. We hail
this gentleman’s appointment to this situation, as we should to almost
any situation upon earth, which removed him from the function of
President of the Chamber of Deputies. His gross partiality in that
office, was only surpassed by his indecision, and want of presence of
mind. The scenes of confusion and disturbance which have so often
disgraced the sittings of the Chamber, during the session which has just
expired, were mainly to be ascribed to his incapacity and unfairness.

Edition: current; Page: [461]
The Courrier Français observes on this appointment:

After great efforts of imagination, and when the matter seemed almost
desperate, the name of M. Girod de l’Ain was hit upon; and, what is
almost as extraordinary as the discovery, this name a fait merveille:
nobody’s susceptibility was so easily excited, as to take any umbrage at
the accession of such a colleague; accordingly, the decision was adopted
almost at once. In this state were affairs this morning; and M. Girod de
l’Ain will be Minister of Public Instruction, unless the difficulties
proceed from himself, which is not probable. Since a strong ministry is
wanted, this choice was judicious; it cannot be denied that a Cabinet
which comprises M. de Montalivet and M. Girod de l’Ain, possesses a
certain homogeneity. If this nomination gives rise to much criticism, it
ought likewise to occasion lively and sincere congratulations; the
Chamber of Deputies being the party to whom the latter are addressed.2

the telegraphic despatch given in the Standard,1 relative to an

ringleaders have been arrested: and it is affirmed that a steam-vessel,
which was bringing the Duchess of Berri from Italy, to join the

this prove to be the fact, it is said that the French Government intends
to dismiss the Duchess quietly to her family in Edinburgh, but to deal

166.: DEATHS OF CASIMIR PERIER AND GEORGES CUVIER
 EXAMINER, 20 MAY, 1832, PP. 329-30

This article on the deaths of Périer and Cuvier is headed “London, May
20, 1832.” Though presumably included in the entry in Mill’s
bibliography given at No. 116, it is listed in the Somerville College
copy of the Examiner not as “Article on France” but as “Obituary Notice
of Casimir Périer, and of Cuvier”; it is there enclosed in square
brackets.

m. casimir périer is dead:

-   

    He should have died hereafter—
-   

    There would have been a time for such a word.1

On no view of French politics has France any good to expect from his
ceasing to be Minister. His successors, whosoever they be, will be
chosen from no other party, nor will act upon any other views of policy,
than his; but without the vigour of purpose, the resolute determination
to make all things bend to his conviction, by which he gave a sort of
dignity to the most uninspiring cause which any statesman ever devoted
himself to uphold. In any other hands than his, all the evil of his
system will become more evil, all the redeeming good which was in it
will dwindle away. He was at least an able man—at least a brave man—not
other than an honest man thus far, that the main springs of his conduct
were public, not private motives. He was less scrupulous in the means he
used for compassing what he deemed good ends, than a sound morality will
approve. But where, save in a few instances, have been the French
Ministers, of whom this might not be said? He should have lived, until
there had been a hope of his being replaced by a better man, not by some
one (it matters not whom) among a hundred worse.

We have been no admirers of the policy of M. Périer’s Ministry. But it
is not one short twelvemonth’s alienation, which can efface from our
memory the unwearied public services of fifteen years. We cannot forget,
that to him, more than to any man, belonged the overthrow of the Villèle
Administration; the first decisive check to the royalist faction: whose
encroachments upon all that France had gained by her revolution, were
then only stopped in their formidable advance. And the bodily
constitution which has at length succumbed to a long series of labours
and vexations, was first broken by the fatigues of the daily and hourly
struggle of life and death which he maintained with Villèle at the
tribune Edition: current; Page: [463] of that memorable chamber, which
contained three hundred creatures of the Jesuits, and but sixteen
representatives of the people.

This arduous contest, in which he displayed talents which excited the
admiration even of the courtiers of Charles X (of him alone, among the
leaders of the liberal party, they never spoke without respect) will be
his chief title to the friendly remembrance of posterity; and to this,
in order that the remembrance may be as affectionate as possible, let it
go down to posterity that he in reality sacrificed his life. For it is
ill dying a martyr to a falling cause, when that cause is also one which
ought to fall. Cranmer and Latimer and Ridley2 will live for ever; but
is it for his martyrdom that we remember Sir Thomas More? Devotion to a
long line of kings, or to a constitution which has stood the shock of
ages, though now rotten, and worm-eaten, and harbouring unclean vermin,
we can understand. But to die for a temporary compromise, a patch-work
of yesterday, a thing constructed on no principle, to which no human
being ever carried hypocrisy so far as to pretend to have any
attachment, to which nobody affects to look for any guidance, but only
for keeping him from being robbed or murdered;—to be martyred for
worshiping at an empty shrine—without an oracle, without a God, without
even an idol; no Gothic cathedral or Grecian temple, but a wooden shed,
run up in a hurry, because any shelter was better than the open sky, and
which men resort to, not because it is good, but because they know not
whither to seek for any other—is a death little worthy of an apotheosis;
no dying for one’s country, but a common suicide.

It is not by this that M. Périer will hereafter be known. Happily for
his fame, while the last year of his life, from the insignificance of
its permanent results, will sink gradually into comparative oblivion,
the former years, because their consequences become every day more
momentous, will loom greater and greater in the distance, even as they
recede from the eye of mankind still moving onward. And when the noisy
and acrimonious disputes of the present day shall be stilled, and he and
his contemporaries shall be judged, with those large allowances of which
all the men of the present generation stand so sorely in need; then may
the close of his career again be profitably reverted to, as a lesson of
indulgence rather than as a subject of reproach; and errors, for which
he has so cruelly suffered, and the evil effects of which shall long
since have been cured and past away, may perhaps render him more
interesting to men of those days, than even if his character had been a
more perfect one.

For ourselves, we shall hereafter speak of him no otherwise than in
honour; he Edition: current; Page: [464] now belongs to history; his
greatest enemies may now be content that their quarrel with him should
be buried in his grave.

Almost at the same time, France has lost another of her most eminent
men, the celebrated naturalist, Cuvier; the most distinguished, perhaps,
among the physical philosophers of his age; and less honourably noted,
as the humble servant of all governments. M. Cuvier was far vainer of
being supposed a man of importance in politics, than of his immense
merit and reputation as a man of science, and was the laughing-stock of
Paris, for the ridiculous consequence which he attached to his title of
Baron. Yet, although a conseiller d’état for some fifteen years, and
latterly a Peer of France, he continued lecturing at the Ecole de
Médecine on comparative anatomy and physiology till within a few days of
his death: a striking fact, and one which throws great light on the
state of feeling in France on many important matters.

It is now affirmed, that the lady found in the Carlo Alberto
steam-packet is not the Duchess of Berri, and that the real Duchess has
escaped.1 Some, on the other hand, surmise that this is the real
Duchess; and that the Government, after officially announcing the fact,
now asserts the contrary, to get rid of the embarrassing alternative of
either bringing her to trial or liberating her by an assumption of
authority contrary to law.


168.: PEMBERTON’S LECTURES ON SHAKESPEARE
 EXAMINER, 3 JUNE, 1832, P. 358

Charles Reece Pemberton (1790-1840) quickly abandoned an acting career
in 1829 after receiving mixed notices of his Virginius and Shylock
(under Charles Kemble’s Edition: current; Page: [465] management) and
devoted himself to lecturing, largely at mechanics’ institutes. He also
became a frequent contributor to the Monthly Repository. This unheaded
review in the “Theatrical Examiner,” is described in Mill’s bibliography
as “A notice of Mr. Pemberton’s Lectures on Shakespeare in the Examiner
of 3d June 1832” (MacMinn, p. 21). In the Somerville College set of the
Examiner, it is listed as “Article on Mr Pemberton’s Lectures on the
Characters of Shakespeare” and enclosed in square brackets.

mr. pemberton is now delivering, at Saville House, Leicester Square, a
series of lectures on some of the principal characters of Shakspeare
(illustrated by the characteristic delivery of the most striking
passages), which we think highly worthy of the attention of the public.

Mr. Pemberton’s object is not solely to state and establish his view of
the particular characters delineated by Shakspeare, but still more to
set forth and illustrate his own theory on the subject of acting. This
theory, though not the prevalent one, is not peculiar to him; and we
conceive that it must have occurred to almost every one who has given
himself the trouble to think long and attentively on the subject: we
ourselves have stated the same doctrine pretty fully in this newspaper,
just a year ago, (Examiner of the 22d May 1831), in our remarks on the
admirable acting of Mademoiselle Léontine Fay.1 The proposition is
simply this: that in acting, as in every thing else, genius does not
consist in being a copyist; even from nature: That the actor of genius
is not he who observes and imitates what men of particular characters,
and in particular situations, do, but he who can, by an act of
imagination, actually be what they are: who can so completely
understand, and so vividly conceive, the state of their minds, that the
conception shall call up in his own the very emotions, and thereby draw
from him the very sounds and gestures, which would have been exhibited
by the imaginary being whom he is personifying. Such a man’s
representation of nature will have a consistency and keeping in it, and
will reach depths in the human heart, which no man’s opportunities and
powers of mere outward observation could ever have enabled him to attain
to.

If any one doubts this, we exhort him to go without delay, and see and
hear Madame Schröder Devrient;2 and if he does not admit that such
acting as hers comes not from the eyes and ears, but from the heart, we
give him up, as a person not competent, in respect of sensibility, to
judge of Art.

Mr. Pemberton knows these truths so well, and explains them so happily,
that he would be well worth listening to, even were he incapable of
practically exemplifying them. But he also lays claim to the actual
possession of the faculty Edition: current; Page: [466] to which we have
alluded: the power to call up by a voluntary effort of imagination, what
he not unhappily terms secondary feelings, that is, feelings suggested
by a vivid conception of similar feelings in others: and by thus
realizing for the time being, an imaginary character, to give a
profoundly true dramatic representation of it. Though his claim to these
powers cannot by us at least, be admitted without considerable
explanation and qualification, yet we must, in the main, admit it; and
we can at least promise to our intelligent readers both amusement and
instruction from listening to him.

Mr. Pemberton has hitherto lectured on three characters only; Macbeth,
Hamlet, and Shylock: we have heard him on the two former; and he has
certainly succeeded in giving us a far clearer and more comprehensive
view of those characters than we had before.

the most important circumstance which has occurred in France during the
last week was a meeting of the leading deputies of the Opposition, at
the house of M. Laffitte, for the purpose of drawing up a collective
address to the nation.1

When this manifesto shall be agreed upon, and shall make its appearance,
it will doubtless excite much interest here; among those at least who do
not think, with the Times of Friday last, that the internal affairs of
France are no concern of the British public, because they are not
connected with “English interests.”2 The Times wrongs the British
public, and wrongs even itself. We should feel shame for our country if
such things were true. We know not why it should be less shameful in a
nation than in an individual, to care about nothing but its own
interest; nor why we should impute to Englishmen the egregious folly of
deeming the interests of good government and civilization throughout the
world no interests of theirs. This is but a poor sample of English
feeling from the “leading journal,” on the very day which brings us the
news of a patriotic banquet at Paris, whereat M. Armand Carrel, the
Editor of the only influential Paris newspaper in which there lingered
some remains of anti-English feeling, was selected, perhaps Edition:
current; Page: [467] for that very reason, to give, as a toast, “The
People of England,” with expression of the warmest sympathy and
congratulation upon our late glorious though pacific Three Days.3

A subscription is getting up among the friends and dependants of the
Ministry for a monument to M. Casimir Périer. We predict that it will
bear a closer resemblance to the subscription for Chambord, so
felicitously shown up by the admirable Paul Louis Courier,4 than to the
grateful adoption by the French nation of the children of General Foy;
when the poorest and humblest citizens of France gave each his mite to
shield the orphans of him who was her stay, from the honourable poverty
which his virtues had bequeathed to them.5


170.: DEATH OF JEREMY BENTHAM
 EXAMINER, 10 JUNE, 1832, PP. 371-2

The death on 6 June of Jeremy Bentham, the day before the great triumph
of the enactment of the Reform Bill, signalled the end of an epoch for
the Reform movement, and for Mill, just approaching an assessment of his
own role as a reformer. The text of this article is remarkably close in
many respects to Thomas Southwood Smith’s dissection eulogy on the day
before this article was published; see A Lecture Delivered over the
Remains of Jeremy Bentham, Esq., in the Webb-Street School of Anatomy
and Medicine on the 9th of June, 1832 (London: Wilson, 1832). Compare
also Mill’s comments on Bentham in 1833 and 1838 (CW, Vol. X, pp. 3-18
and 75-115). The unsigned obituary, headed as title, appears in the
“Political Examiner.” It is described in Mill’s bibliography as “An
obituary notice of Jeremy Bentham in the Examiner of 10th June 1832”
(MacMinn, p. 21). In the Somerville College set of the Examiner, it is
listed as “Death of Jeremy Bentham,” with square brackets around the
portion ending at a printer’s rule; the rest of the article, not by
Mill, gives the details of Bentham’s life.

jeremy bentham is no more! In him, the world has lost the great Teacher
and Patriarch of his time; the man who of all men who were living on the
day of his death, has exercised and is exercising over the fortunes of
mankind the widest Edition: current; Page: [468] and most durable
influence; and who is even now in some sort governing the world,
although not yet recognized and looked up to as their leader by those
who are daily obeying the impulse which he gave; no unusual fate of the
real guides and rulers of mankind, especially in these latter days.

Had such a man died at an earlier period of his life of usefulness, when
much of his task yet remained for him to perform, and many years of
possible existence to perform it in, there would have been room for
sorrow and lamentation. It is one of the evils of the untimely death of
a great man, that it mixes other feelings with those with which alone
the thought of a departed sage or hero ought to be associated—joy and
pride that our nature has been found capable of again producing such a
man, and affectionate gratitude for the good which we and our posterity
have received from him. Such feelings only can find a fitting place near
the tomb of Jeremy Bentham; nor know we, since all must die, what
happier or more glorious end could have been desired for him, than to
die just now, after living such a life. He has died full of years, and
(so far as regards all minds throughout the world, which are yet fitted
for appreciating him) of honours. He has lived to see many of the
objects of his life in a train of accomplishment, and the realization of
the remainder rendered certain at no remote period. He has achieved the
hardest, but the noblest of problems, that of a well-directed and
victorious existence, and has now finished his work and lain down to
rest.

This is not the time for a complete estimate of the results of his
labours. He is not like one of those who go to their grave and are no
more thought of. The value of such a life to mankind, which is even now
insensibly making itself acknowledged, will be felt more and more, as
men shall become more capable of knowing the hand which guides them. Nor
need we fear any lack of opportunities for commemorating what philosophy
owes to him, when all which has been doing for ten years in English
politics and legislation, and all which shall be done for twice ten
more, proclaims and will proclaim his name and merits in no inaudible
voice to all who can trace the influence of Opinion upon Events, and of
a great mind upon Opinion. These things, however, are worthy of notice
at the present hour, chiefly as they conduce to a due appreciation of
his life; and under this aspect also, as under so many others, will they
continue valuable, not for to-day or to-morrow only, (but so far as
eternity can belong to any thing human) for ever.

Let it be remembered what was the state of jurisprudence and
legislation, and of the philosophy of jurisprudence and legislation,
when he began his career. A labyrinth without a clue—a jungle, through
which no path had ever been cut. All systems of law then established,
but most of all that in which he himself was nurtured, were masses of
deformity, in the construction of which reason in any shape whatever had
had little to do, a comprehensive consideration of ends and means
nothing at all: their foundation the rude contrivances of a barbarous
age, even more deeply barbarous in this than in aught else; the
superstructure an Edition: current; Page: [469] infinite series of
patches, some larger, some smaller, stuck on in succession wherever a
hole appeared, and plastered one over another until the monstrous mass
exceeded all measurable bulk, and went beyond the reach of the strongest
understanding and the finest memory. Such was the practice of law: was
its theory in any better state? And how could it be so? for of what did
that theory consist, but either of purely technical principles, got at
by abstraction from these established systems, (or rather, constructed,
generally in utter defiance of logic, with the sole view of giving
something like coherence and consistency in appearance to provisions
which in reality were utterly heterogeneous); or of vague cloudy
generalities arbitrarily assumed à priori, and called laws of nature, or
principles of natural law.

Such was existing jurisprudence and that it should be such, was less
surprising than the superstition by which, being such, it was protected.
The English people had contrived to persuade themselves, and had to a
great degree persuaded the rest of the world, that the English law, as
it was when Mr. Bentham found it, was the perfection of reason.1 That it
was otherwise, was the only political heresy, which no one had been
found hardy enough to avow; even the English constitution you might (if
you did it very gently) speak ill of,—but not the English law: Whig,
Tory, and Democrat joined in one chorus of clamorous admiration,
whenever the law or the courts of justice were the subject of discourse:
and to doubt the merits of either appeared a greater stretch of
absurdity than to question the doctrine of gravitation.

This superstition was at its height, when Mr. Bentham betook himself to
the study of English law, with no other object than the ordinary one of
gaining his living by practising a liberal profession. But he soon found
that it would not do for him, and that he could have no dealing or
concern with it in an honest way, except to destroy it. And there is a
deep interest now, at the close of his life, in looking back to his very
first publication, the Fragment on Government, which appeared
considerably more than half a century ago,2 and which exhibits, at that
remote period, a no less strong and steady conviction than appears in
his very latest production, that the worship of the English law was a
degrading idolatry—that instead of being the perfection of reason, it
was a disgrace to the human understanding—and that a task worthy of him,
or any other wise and brave man, to devote a life to, was that of
utterly eradicating it and sweeping it away. This accordingly became the
task of his own existence: glory to him! for he has successfully
accomplished it. The monster has received from him its death wound.
After losing many a limb, it still drags on, and will drag on for a few
years more, a feeble and exanimate existence; but it never will recover.
It is going down rapidly to the grave.

Edition: current; Page: [470]
Mr. Bentham has fought this battle for now almost sixty years; the
greater part of that time without assistance from any human being,
except latterly what M. Dumont gave him in putting his ideas into
French;3 and for a long time almost without making one human being a
convert to his opinions. He exhausted every mode of attack; he assailed
the enemy with every weapon, and at all points; now he fell upon the
generalities, now upon the details; now he combatted evil by stripping
it naked, and showing that it was evil; and now by contrasting it with
good. At length his energy and perseverance triumphed. Some of the most
potent leaders of the public became convinced; and they, in their turn,
convinced or persuaded others: until at last the English law, as a
systematic whole, is given up by every body, and the question, with all
thinking minds even among lawyers, is no longer about keeping it as it
is, but only whether, in rebuilding, there be a possibility of using any
of the old materials.*

Mr. Bentham was the original mover in this mighty change. His hand gave
the impulse which set all the others at work. To him the debt is due, as
much as any other great work has ever been owing to the man who first
guided other men to the accomplishment of it. The man who has achieved
this, can afford to die. He has done enough to render his name for ever
illustrious.

But Mr. Bentham has been much more than merely a destroyer. Like all who
discredit erroneous systems by arguments drawn from principles, and not
from mere results, he could not fail, even while destroying the old
edifice, to lay a solid foundation for the new. Indeed he considered it
a positive duty never to assail what is established, without having a
clear view of what ought to be substituted. It is to the intrinsic value
of his speculations on the philosophy of law in general, that he owes
the greater part of his existing reputation; for by these alone is he
known to his continental readers, who are far the most numerous, and by
whom, in general, he is far more justly appreciated than in England.
There are some most important branches of the science of law, which were
in a more wretched state than almost any of the others when he took them
in hand, and which he has so exhausted, that he seems to have left
nothing to be sought by future enquirers; we mean the departments of
Procedure, Evidence,4 and the Edition: current; Page: [471] Judicial
Establishment.5 He has done almost all that remained to perfect the
theory of punishment.6 It is with regard to (what is the foundation of
all) the civil code, that he has done least, and left most to be done.7
Yet even here his services have been invaluable, by making far clearer
and more familiar than they were before, both the ultimate and the
immediate ends of civil law; the essential characteristics of a good
law; the expediency of codification, that is, of law written and
systematic; by exposing the viciousness of the existing language of
jurisprudence, guarding the student against the fallacies which lurk in
it, and accustoming him to demand a more precise and
logically-constructed nomenclature.

Mr. Bentham’s exertions have not been limited to the field of
jurisprudence, or even to that of general politics, in which he ranks as
the first name among the philosophic radicals. He has extended his
speculations to morals, though never (at least in his published works)
in any great detail; and on this, as on every other subject which he
touched, he cannot be read without great benefit.

Some of his admirers have claimed for him the title of founder of the
science of morals, as well as of the science of legislation; on the
score of his having been the first person who established the principle
of general utility, as the philosophic foundation of morality and law.
But Mr. Bentham’s originality does not stand in need of any such
exaggeration. The doctrine of utility, as the foundation of virtue, he
himself professes to have derived from Hume:8 he applied it more
consistently and in greater detail, than his predecessors; but the idea
itself is as old as the earliest Greek philosophers, and has divided the
philosophic world, in every age of philosophy, since their time. Mr.
Bentham’s real merit, in respect to the foundation of morals, consists
in his having cleared it more thoroughly than any of his predecessors,
from the rubbish of pretended natural law, natural justice, and the
like, by which men were wont to consecrate as a rule of morality,
whatever they felt inclined to approve of without knowing why.

The most prominent moral qualities which appear in Mr. Bentham’s
writings, are love of justice, and hatred of imposture: his most
remarkable intellectual endowments, a penetrating deep-sighted
acuteness, precision in the use of scientific language, and sagacity and
inventiveness in matters of detail. There have been few minds so
perfectly original. He has often, we think, been surpassed in powers of
metaphysical analysis, as well as in comprehensiveness Edition: current;
Page: [472] and many-sidedness of mind.9 He frequently contemplates a
subject only from one or a few of its aspects; though he very often sees
further into it, from the one side on which he looks at it, than was
seen before even by those who had gone all round it. There is something
very striking, occasionally, in the minute elaborateness with which he
works out, into its smallest details, one half-view of a question,
contrasted with his entire neglect of the remaining half-view, though
equally indispensable to a correct judgment of the whole. To this
occasional one-sidedness, he failed to apply the natural cure; for, from
the time when he embarked in original speculation, he occupied himself
very little in studying the ideas of others. This, in almost any other
than himself, would have been a fault; in him, we shall only say, that,
but for it, he would have been a greater man.

Mr. Bentham’s style has been much criticised; and undoubtedly, in his
latter writings, the complicated structure of his sentences renders it
impossible, without some familiarity, to read them with rapidity and
ease. But his earlier, among which are some of his most valuable
productions, are not only free from this defect, but may even, in point
of ease and elegance, be ranked among the best English compositions.
Felicity of expression abounds even in those of his works which are
generally unreadable; and volumes might be filled with passages selected
from his later as well as his earlier publications, which, for wit and
eloquence, have seldom been surpassed.

Few persons have ever lived whose lot in life, viewed on the whole, can
be considered more enviable than that of Mr. Bentham. During a life
protracted far beyond the ordinary length, he enjoyed, almost without
interruption, perfect bodily health. In easy circumstances, he was able
to devote his whole time and energies to the pursuits of his choice,
those which exercised his highest faculties, moral and intellectual, and
supplied him with the richest fund of delightful excitement. His retired
habits saved him from personal contact with any but those who sought his
acquaintance because they valued it. Few men have had more enthusiastic
admirers; and if the hack writers of his day, and some who ought to have
known better, often spoke of him with ridicule and contempt, he never
read them, and therefore they never disturbed his tranquillity. Along
with his passion for abstruser studies, and the lively interest which he
felt in public events, he retained to the last a childlike freshness and
excitability, which enabled him to derive pleasure from the minutest
trifles, and gave to his old age the playfulness, lightheartedness, and
keen relish of life, so seldom found except in early youth. In his
intercourse with his friends he was remarkable for gaiety Edition:
current; Page: [473] and easy pleasantry; it was his season of
relaxation; and in conversing he seldom touched upon the great subjects
of his intellectual exertions.

His principal works are his Introduction to the Principles of Morals and
Legislation;10 the Fragment on Government, already referred to; the
Rationale of Judicial Evidence, in five volumes, including a very full
examination of the procedure of the English courts;11 The Book of
Fallacies; the Plan of a Judicial Establishment, one of his most
finished productions, printed in 1792, but never regularly published;
his Defence of Usury; Panopticon,12 an admirable work on prison
discipline; and many others: besides the excellent treatises edited in
French by M. Dumont, from the above works and various unpublished
manuscripts, and containing all his most important doctrines, well
stated and illustrated, though with little of the piquant criticism on
existing institutions with which they were always interspersed in his
own writings.


171.: FRENCH NEWS [63]
 EXAMINER, 10 JUNE, 1832, P. 377

Since Mill’s last article on French affairs, the leftist leaders and
secret societies, disappointed that Périer’s death had not been followed
by a change in government policy, had tried to start an insurrection,
using as occasion the funeral on 5 June of the popular General Lamarque.
The turmoil was increased by the participation of the Bonapartists and
Carlists. Fighting continued for two days, with 800 killed or wounded.
Mill was much preoccupied in subsequent articles with the imposition of
martial law by the government and the harsh trials of the alleged
conspirators, signs of the fragility of the gains of July 1830. For the
entry in Mill’s bibliography, see No. 116. The item, headed “London,
June 10, 1832,” is listed in the Somerville College set of the Examiner
as “Article on France” with the first three paragraphs enclosed in
square brackets (the rest of the article is in smaller type).

before this paper meets the eyes of our readers, it will be known
whether a new revolution has or has not taken place at Paris. At the
moment when we write, it is only known that an immense concourse of
people assembled on Tuesday at the funeral of General Lamarque; that a
collision, apparently unpremeditated, took place between the people and
the troops; that a desperate struggle commenced in almost all parts of
Paris, which, beginning in the afternoon, lasted till late at Edition:
current; Page: [474] night; that the Government, by telegraph, the next
day announced the suppression of the insurrection, but that hostilities
afterwards broke out afresh, with what result it is yet unknown.1

A day or two before these events, civil war had also broken out in the
West. The roving bands of Chouans, who had rendered life and property
insecure for a twelvemonth before, and whom the Government had taken no
means effectually to suppress, had at last swelled into a general rising
of the Carlist party. The Duchess of Berri and M. Bourmont were among
them, having, it is now ascertained, effected a landing near Marseilles
before the capture of the vessel which brought them from Italy and
Spain; and having contrived, either by the connivance, or the want of
vigilance of the authorities, to make their way to La Vendée.2 But a few
weeks before, the contemptible Ministry of Louis Philippe had obtained
from the Chamber of Deputies a parting gift of three millions of francs
for secret police expenses.3 The money, we may be very sure, has been
spent; yet, in spite of passports and all the formalities and restraints
of the French Police Administration, two persons, who must be so well
known, have crossed France from one side to the other undiscovered.

General Clouet is said to be at the head of the Carlist insurgents.4 The
National Guard has every where taken arms against them. Cathelineau, a
son of the celebrated Vendean chief, has been killed by a party of
Government troops.5

 EXAMINER, 17 JUNE, 1832, PP. 392-4

This lengthy and detailed account follows up the general discussion of
the session in No. 162. For the entry in Mill’s bibliography, see No.
116. The item, headed “London, June 17, 1832,” is listed in the
Somerville College set of the Examiner as “Article on France” and
enclosed in square brackets.

Edition: current; Page: [475]
the following article, on the results of the Session of the French
Chambers, was written, and even in print, before the late catastrophe.1
It is as true now as it was then, and will be as useful, if it ever
could have been useful; we, therefore, persevere in our intention of
publishing it.

the nature and amount of the doings of the French Chambers, during the
session which has just expired, raise a serious doubt of the capacity of
those assemblies as at present constituted, we will not say to legislate
tolerably, but to legislate at all. For our part we have watched the
progress of the session from day to day, in hopes of learning what a
Chamber of Deputies is intended for—what function it is designed to
fulfil in the body politic: and we regret to be obliged to confess, that
this remains as much a mystery to us as ever: the use and purpose of
that somewhat noisy and vapouring member of the French sovereignty has
not transpired. While Charles X reigned in France, it had a mission
which was obvious enough; it was sent there to resist and overawe the
King, in case he attempted to bring back the emigrants and the priests.
The present King, however, is suspected of no such propensities; and,
that the Chamber does not deem itself intended for an antagonist power
to his, it demonstrates by throwing its whole weight into his scale. On
the other hand, it clearly is not appointed to make laws. We have our
suspicions that its allotted office is to prevent them from being made.
For it is a fact, not unworthy of commemoration, that if the Chambers,
instead of sitting nine months, had sat only one day, and had employed
it in passing a vote of confidence in the Ministry, and another vote
authorizing the King, until the opening of the next session, to enact
whatever laws he pleased by ordonnance, France would now have been in
the actual enjoyment of a considerable number of very passable laws,
affecting some of her most important interests; for many such have been
presented by the Government. But now we question if one single law has
passed the Chambers during three-fourths of a year of continued sitting,
for the passing of which the French, or any other portion of mankind,
will be perceptibly the better:—the number of those which have had even
an apparent tendency that way, is contemptibly small; while every
measure of any intricacy or importance standing for debate, which could
possibly be put by, without bringing all things to a dead stand, has not
even come on for discussion.

There were three questions which could by no contrivance be put off to
another session. There was the budget, a question of every year; the
civil list, a question for the first year of every reign; and the
reconstitution of the peerage, a question for this year in particular.2
These three things, in one way or another, it Edition: current; Page:
[476] was absolutely indispensable to get through. And if it be asked,
what has the Chamber done, the answer which must be returned is, these
three things. The wise men of France have laid their heads together for
nine months, or until the cholera morbus dispersed them, for the purpose
of accomplishing these three things.

The Ministry, however, gave them the opportunity of effecting much
besides this. The following, among other bills, were drawn up by
Ministers, and laid before one or other of the two Chambers, mostly at
an early period of the session:—

A bill for establishing a school or schools in every town and every
village or parish in France, at which no inconsiderable amount of useful
instruction would have been given to the whole of the rising generation;
public provision being made for defraying the expense, where the parties
themselves were not in a condition to sustain it;3

Three bills,4 which, together with the municipal law passed in the
preceding session,5 were destined to substitute for Napoleon’s odious
system of centralization, local representative assemblies, invested with
adequate powers of local legislation, administration, and taxation;

A bill for the general revision of the custom laws of France, and for
the relaxation of some of the restrictions on trade;6

A bill for abridging in some, though far from a sufficient degree, the
tedious and expensive formalities and law proceedings, necessary for
dispossessing individuals of landed property required for the purpose of
public works, such as roads, railways, and canals7—a most serious
obstacle to the improvement of the productive resources of that fine
country,—as may be judged when we mention, that rather than resort to
the legal process, road and canal companies or the state not
unfrequently find it their interest to pay for a piece of land four or
five times its value;

A bill for giving representative assemblies, and a government of law, to
the French colonies8—which have hitherto, in defiance of a distinct
promise in the Charter of 1814,9 remained under the illegal régime of
royal proclamations;

A bill for securing to officers in the army and navy, the possession of
their Edition: current; Page: [477] rank in the service, and preventing
them from being dismissed from it, except after sentence of a
court-martial.10

One of these bills, the last, has passed the Chamber of Peers, but did
not come in time for discussion in the Chamber of Deputies: the seven
others, neither of those hard-worked and ill-used bodies found leisure
to enter upon. And when we consider the length and intricacy of the
provisions they contain, and the snail’s pace at which these two
assemblies travel at all times, except when the cholera is at their
heels, the passing of these eight statutes is as much as there seems any
likelihood of their accomplishing, together with the regular annual
business, in several sessions to come. And yet (though all these bills
are very defective, and stand greatly in need of being remodelled)
whoever has sufficiently adverted to the proceedings of the two
Chambers, to have formed an estimate of their fitness, moral and
intellectual, to cope with such subjects, may safely predict that the
sum of all the amendments they will introduce into the eight bills, are
not worth the postponement of the first alone (the Education Bill) for
one single year.

The Ministry proposed three other measures, of importance in themselves,
and valuable still more highly as an earnest of further improvements to
come: these were—

A corn bill, which permitted exportation and importation at all times,
subject to much lower duties than before, and abolished, not entirely,
but in a great measure, the absurd division of France into many
districts, each with a separate corn law of its own;11

And two bills, reducing the exorbitant bounties on the whale and cod
fisheries.12

For the corn bill of the Ministry, the Chamber substituted another of
its own,13 abolishing indeed the prohibition, so far as respects
importation, but retaining the high duties, and the division of the
country, such as they were fixed by the very worst of all the previous
corn bills.14 In the bounties to the fisheries, the Chamber made but a
small reduction, instead of the great one proposed by the Ministry.

These specimens of what the Chambers have not found time to touch upon,
and of what they have touched, and spoiled in the handling, give the
measure of their fitness for legislation, as contrasted even with the
second-rate statesmen who at present fill the various departments of the
French Ministry.

Edition: current; Page: [478]
As a set-off to all these things which they could not find time to
consider of, or which they considered of, and could not find in their
hearts to do, the following is a table of the things which they have
actually done. We omit the remodelling of the peerage, as a thing which
they could not avoid, and of which, therefore, the credit or discredit
depends wholly on the manner of doing it.

They have passed two bills for the extension of the warehousing
system:15 measures right in principle, and, perhaps, not wholly useless
in practice, but which might have been dispatched in the same number of
days; and even at the slow rate at which the Chambers wind their way
through the maze of additions and amendments which invariably start up
on all sides, did not occupy them for more than a week, or thereabouts.

They have abolished in some small number of cases the punishment of
death16—a penalty but rarely inflicted in France, comparatively
speaking. This bill may possibly make the difference of one or two
executions in a year. They have also mitigated in some measure the law
of imprisonment for debt.17

They have tampered with the existing laws on the subject of recruiting,
and of promotion in the army and navy;18 perhaps, the only part of the
constitutional law of France with which the public was on the whole not
discontented. Though possessing a specious equality which recommends
them to the French people, and probably not ill-adapted to the
circumstances of France, the principles of her military organization are
open to well-grounded objection, being no other than the conscription on
the one hand, and rigid legal restraints upon rapidity of promotion on
the other. But these principles are not meddled with by the new
enactments: all the alterations are in the details; and as far as we are
able to judge, there is not one which is either decidedly for the worse,
or decidedly for the better, though the passing of them has wasted as
much time, and stirred up as much ill-blood, as if the destinies of the
French nation hung suspended upon it.

Lastly, greatest achievement of all!—a bill has been passed, by which
the elder branch of the Bourbon family is exiled from France.19 This
statute does not even provide any penalty in case the parties concerned
should attempt to return from banishment; it is, therefore, in every
sense as harmless to all mankind, as a parliamentary recognition that
there is a sun in heaven, or the legislative enactment by which the
Convention, during the reign of Robespierre, determined Edition:
current; Page: [479] that there was, or should thereafter be, a God.20
Of this crowning glory of the session of 1831, the Chambers are entitled
to the undivided credit. The Ministers had no share in it, and the
liberal press washed their hands of it. So important a matter, naturally
could not be brought to a successful issue without some squabbles;
accordingly a dispute broke out between the two houses, and the bill
flew backwards and forwards from one to the other several times, like a
shuttle-cock, before they could agree in what terms the unmeaning
announcement should be made.

There remains only the unavoidable business of the session—the money
bills, and the change in the constitution of the second branch of the
legislature.

The inheritableness of the Peerage has been abolished. The majority of
the deputies had given pledges to their constituents, which rendered
this no longer optional with them. But it was not enough to regulate the
succession to the Peerage, the Peers themselves remaining as they were
before. If there has been any difference in their conduct since the
passing of the bill, it is that they have been more audacious than ever
in their resistance to public opinion. The law of divorce, which had
passed the Chamber of Deputies with scarcely a dissenting voice, they
ignominiously threw out.21 The bill abolishing the ridiculous
celebration of the martyrdom of Louis XVI, met with the same fate.22 M.
Salverte’s proposition for allowing the unfinished business of one
session to be proceeded with in the next, which from its manifest
expediency had met with universal assent in the elective chamber, was
rejected by the Peers.23 The quarrel between the two houses respecting
the bill for banishing the Bourbons, has been already alluded to; we
wish that we had room to place it before our readers, in all its
ridiculous details.24 Finally, they so fell out respecting a clause in
the law for closing the accounts of the financial year 1829,25 that the
prorogation took place Edition: current; Page: [480] before the dispute
was brought to an issue; and that important part of the annual business
of the country remains still unperformed.

With regard to the public expenditure, this has been a session of large
prodigality, and petty economy. Seldom has there been seen in the memory
of representative governments, an assembly so penny-wise, nor one so
pound-foolish. Few governments excite an Englishman’s surprise so much
as the French does by the absurd multitude of its public officers, and
by the curiously small quantity of work, day by day, which seems to be
expected from each of them; while at the same time, he is often no less
astonished at the low rate at which some of the most important and
dignified functionaries are remunerated. The Deputies, having come up
from their departments boiling over with economy, vented their noble
rage by curtailing, not the number of the officers of government, but
their salaries; beginning with the most important of all, the judges,
for which station if for any, there ought to be the means of purchasing
first rate abilities; whose pay already was not large, even with
reference to the average of incomes in France, and now falls short of
what many English attornies give to their clerks. But there is fully as
much jobbery as imbecility in this. The public voice insisted upon some
retrenchment; and it was the desire of the deputies that places should
at all events continue numerous, in order that they might retain the
power of dispensing to as great a number of persons as possible, that
swelling turkey-cock dignity and self-importance, which the lowest
member of the French bureaucratie, though he touch but a few sous a day,
feels himself equally a partaker of with the highest.

All the oppressive taxes on the necessaries of life have been continued;
not a thought entertained of commuting them for any others less
burthensome upon the many: but while borrowing with one hand to defray
current expences, with the other they flung away into the lap of the
landed proprietors, the extra land tax which was laid on afresh last
year, after a reduction of double the amount a few years ago.26 The loss
is supplied partly by a larger borrowing, partly by laying additional
taxes upon the public at large.

Finally, so ignorant was the majority of the Chamber of the very first
principles of finance, that they would not suspend the operation of
paying off debt until there should be money to pay withal, but continued
to buy up old debt by contracting new. That any human being, to say
nothing of a whole people, should have been capable of being so far
juggled as to be made firmly to believe that this was not only an
advantageous financial operation, but a source of unexampled prosperity,
was marvellous enough at any time, even the time of Pitt Edition:
current; Page: [481] and Dundas.27 But that the French Legislature
should believe it still, after so many years of argument, and when the
subject has become too stale even for ridicule, with the newspapers
shouting the true doctrine in their ears, day after day, turning it over
in every way, viewing it under every aspect, and putting it with that
pellucid clearness with which French writers almost always explain
whatever they understand—is something which we should not have thought
possible, and which might well render Dulness herself proud of such
disciples among the élite of a people so renowned for quickness of
apprehension.

Recent events give us unfortunately something to add to what may appear
a disparaging estimate of the utility of the French representative
constitution. We have said that it is of no use, but a hindrance, to the
making of good laws; it is now proved to be quite equally useless as a
protection to the French nation against arbitrary power. The government
of the barricades has done what Charles X was not permitted to do. It
has assumed the power of dispensing with the laws and the courts of
justice. Paris is under martial law.28 Not during the insurrection, but
after it was completely suppressed, and the authority of the regular
tribunals was restored; Louis Philippe has assumed the power of trying
all offences by a Court Martial, with the declared intention of
exercising that power retrospectively—not only against persons taken in
arms, or suspected of being concerned in the insurrection, but against
the writers of any articles in newspapers which he affects to consider
as constituting their authors accessaries to revolt. A warrant has been
issued against M. Armand Carrel, the principal editor of the National,
and the most powerful writer among the journalists in France. Never
having been able to obtain a verdict against M. Carrel from a Paris
jury, the Government has taken this method of depriving him and others
of the protection of jury-trial.

Well was it said not long ago, by an enlightened Frenchman, no friend to
a Republic or Republicans—“you, in England, are accustomed to see even
bad Governments keep within the bounds of law; but, with us, it is
universally understood that une constitution, c’est pour rire!”29 This
is the meaning of the fetish-worship professed by the rabid moderate
party, for l’ordre légal.30 Respect for the law is easily observed, when
you have the laws of the old régime, and those of the Reign of Terror,
to fall back upon; and when you are able to Edition: current; Page:
[482] revive an edict of the despot Napoleon,31 for the purpose of
setting aside several distinct articles of the Charter. So, again, the
Republicans, if they had prevailed, had no occasion to violate the law;
they needed only to enforce the decree of the Convention banishing
Louis-Philippe from France;32 for it has never been abrogated, and,
consequently, by his Citizen Majesty’s own logic, is as valid as ever.

There is not an article of the Charter more express and formal than
this, nul ne pourra être distrait de ses juges naturels, to which it was
added, “there shall never more be created extraordinary commissions or
tribunals.” In the Charter of 1814, one exception was reserved,—that of
cours prévôtales: this exception was suppressed in the Charter of 1830,
and the provision which it qualified remains without any
qualification.33

Another article of the Charter declares expressly, that the King shall
in no case whatever be at liberty to set aside the laws, or dispense
with their execution.34

But what matters it? The people thought they had abolished the trial of
political offences by packed commissions; but did not Napoleon once
issue an edict authorising it?35 The Duke of Reichstadt, we suspect, is
lawful Emperor of the French at this moment, by virtue of another edict
of the same Napoleon.36

It is not yet known who is or is not compromised, or whom the Government
means to make its victims. Its whole conduct with respect to émeutes,
conspiracies, and the press, for the last twelve-month, convinces us
that it will not be troubled with many scruples in taking this
opportunity of ridding itself of any troublesome enemy. Fortunately,
most of the leading Republicans were already in prison; so that it would
be rather too great a stretch of audacity to impute any participation to
them. Warrants have, it seems, been issued against three Deputies, MM.
Garnier-Pagès, Laboissière, and Cabet.37

Edition: current; Page: [483]
All medical men have been ordered by the Government, under a penalty, to
make a return of the wounded; which most of them have honourably and
spiritedly refused to do.

These events have produced a salutary reaction of public opinion, in
England, on the affairs of France. The real character of Louis-Philippe
and his advisers might have been preached in the highways, and to all
eternity; the public would never have believed it, until it was proved
by some acts which left no room even for the most ignorant to doubt.

The Times is now furious against the French Government; and will not
take the King into favour again, unless he will “endeavour to heal the
wounds of the nation, by consulting the opinion of those in whom the
nation has reposed its confidence. The formidable party who have signed
the Laffitte manifesto, cannot now be despised with impunity, and must
furnish Ministers either to modify the existing Cabinet, or to supply
its place.”38

This prudent counsel has come somewhat late, methinks. It is scarcely
kind, after having, for eighteen months, applauded and encouraged the
course of policy which has brought on this catastrophe, and denounced
all who opposed it as the silliest or the vilest of mankind, now, when
nothing has changed but the interest of the Times newspaper, to turn
round upon the man whom itself has contributed not a little to mislead
to his ruin, and tell him that he is going wrong, and must alter his
course. It is not quite so easy for a king to change his counsels, as
for the Times to eat its words, or rather, without any confession of
error, to bluster and bully on one side as it had just before blustered
and bullied on the other. Louis-Philippe, thanks to counsellors like the
Times, is so far committed, that it would not be in kingly nature to
retract; and he will go on the remainder of the way to destruction. Even
were he to retrace his steps, the blood which has been shed would
scarcely be forgiven him. There is the barrier of mutual injuries
between him and the Republicans: they are as the serpent and the man in
the fable.39 But a time was, when Louis-Philippe was yet hesitating, or
had a retreat still open behind him, and when the public opinion of
England, energetically declared through the most subservient but the
most powerful of its organs, might have arrested his blind and fatal
career. The weight which might have decided him for good, was thrown
into the scale of evil: and now, when he seems lost beyond redemption,
his adviser turns round upon him, and bids him mend his ways. Just so
was it with Polignac and Charles X.

But would not any man of common candour or feeling, who had written what
the Times has been writing for two years, be now burning with shame and
self-reproach for the calumnies he had propagated against the Mouvement
party in France, painting them in the blackest colours, as men who, from
low passions, Edition: current; Page: [484] reckless obstinacy, or
personal ambition, sought to subvert the government by a Republican
revolution? A Republican revolution is attempted; and the insurgents
turn out to be few in number, with the whole people against them, and
countenanced by no name known to the nation; and just then the Times
discovers that the great bulk of the nation is with the Mouvement party;
that its chiefs have alone the confidence of the French people; that the
King and his Ministers are detested (the very word of the Times);40 and
that the Opposition, who were before classed with the scum of the earth,
ought to be taken into the Ministry.

When, till now, has the Times admitted that there was an opposition
party at all, except Carlists, Napoleonists, and Republicans? or that
any one who held more popular principles than Casimir Périer was a
friend to kingly government, or any government of order and law? All at
once it finds out that it has made the slight mistake of simply leaving
out of its enumeration of parties the majority of the nation.

The wide circulation, and the audacious assuming manner of the Times,
together with a skill and energy in popular writing, which it would be
affectation to undervalue, render it so efficient a promoter of the
popular cause as soon as it finds its account in joining the standard of
improvement, that the real patriots are too apt to forgive, and omit
taking note of its tergiversations. The men who by the labours and
sacrifices of perhaps half their lives, have wrought some valuable idea
into the public mind, and have at last triumphed over prejudices and
indifference, and rendered their cause worth advocating to the mere
trading politicians; having during all this period had to endure, in
nine cases out of ten, all the scorn and contumely which the Times could
express, by putting into requisition the whole of its copious vocabulary
of coarse abuse,—such persons are generally too well pleased to find
themselves sure of carrying their point (which they know they are when
they see the Times advocating it), to be much inclined to quarrel with
the enemy who deserts to them at the eleventh hour. The “leading
journal” then thrusts itself forward to the front of the engagement,
lifts up its loud voice till it drowns all the others, and struts in
triumph over the field of battle, saying, aha! behold my victory. The
real victors have gone forward hours before; they are not seekers of
glory, but of a new work to perform; and are buckling on their armour to
fight a fresh battle, knowing and foreseeing all the while that the
Times will be, as before, their bitter and unscrupulous antagonist in
the fight, and will again join them when on the point of victory.

173.: FRENCH NEWS [65]
 EXAMINER, 24 JUNE, 1832, P. 408

For the uprising, the suppression of which Mill traces here, see Nos.
171 and 172. For the entry in his bibliography, see No. 116. The item,
headed “London, June 24, 1832,” is listed in the Somerville College set
of the Examiner as “Article on France” and enclosed in square brackets.

the longer we reflect upon the present deplorable measures of the French
Government, the more pregnant they appear to us with the most fatal
consequences.

Have the struggles of forty-five years, and the sacrifice of an entire
generation, brought France no nearer than this, we say not to a good
government, but to any government of law? Is it still to be a matter of
course, that whatever is the form of the government, the executive, in
reality, does what it likes; and that a constitution or a charter is not
a thing to be regarded when the Government finds the slightest momentary
convenience in breaking it?

If there were any mode of rivetting in the minds of the French people a
practical conviction that no restraints which they can impose on the
instruments of government are the slightest security to them, and that
the perpetually-impending terror of popular vengeance is alone
sufficient to keep their public men in awe, Louis Philippe and his
Ministers have found that mode. If any thing exists which can make the
next French revolution a sanguinary one, this will do it.

How many years, rather how many ages, of legal protection seem necessary
to engender that habitual reverence for law which is so deeply rooted in
the minds of all classes of Englishmen, from the prince to the pauper!
Never can we too much rejoice that we have accomplished the first and
hardest stage of our national emancipation, and have therefore a
reasonable chance of accomplishing the succeeding stages, without any
sensible weakening of that salutary association; the first and
fundamental condition of good government, and without which any people,
however civilized they may imagine themselves, are little other than
savages.

Is it not the vainest of fancies to look for any sensible improvement in
the government or in the condition of the people, while even honest men
are apt to consider any misconduct on the part of the Government a full
justification for civil war, and when every King, every Minister,
considers every act of resistance to Government a justification for
suspending the constitution and assuming dictatorial power?

Of the two parties who are guilty of the present and of the impending
mischief, incomparably the most guilty is the Government. That small
part of the people of Edition: current; Page: [486] Paris who planned,
or who joined the insurrection, are not without considerable excuse. To
compare them with our own people under recent circumstances, would be to
judge them unfairly. If we English could neither have formed Political
Unions nor held public meetings, how could we have escaped the same
extremity? And with those powers, it was seen in the case of Catholic
emancipation,1 what even such a people as the Irish could do. Both these
invaluable rights are denied to the French nation. There are no means
left open in France, by which public dissatisfaction can manifest itself
through a peaceable display of moral strength. The press is the only
organ of public opinion which exists at all; and the press is weighed
down by taxation, and persecuted by the law-officers of Government, to
the extent, in the case of one single paper,2 of fifty-two prosecutions
within two years.

For the Government, there is now no forgiveness. What no necessity could
excuse, but that which would excuse a revolution, they have done without
even an appearance of necessity. Paris was already quiet; and the
ordinary tribunals would have served the vengeance of the conquerors but
too well. The whole guilt of anarchy and confusion, should such
hereafter ensue, will be on the heads of those who have severed the last
cable which, for eighteen years, has held France, though agitated and
even inundated by the waves, still steady to such anchorage as she had
found, and saved her from drifting out into the unfathomable ocean.
France has now no constitution. It has been well said, by one of her own
writers, that a constitution which is violated is destroyed.3 How much
so then a constitution of yesterday, to which, being consecrated by no
ancient associations, when once relinquished there is no return? A
friend who has been faithful to you from infancy, may be tempted and may
succumb, and yet be trusted again; but the man whose first word to you
is a lie, remains to you a liar for ever.

It is not many weeks since we idly amused ourselves and our readers with
dreams of progressive improvement, and the growth and strengthening of
the national mind, by sober study and manly discussion of the art of
government itself, as distinguished from the mere instrument of
government.4 It is no time now for such thoughts. One of the smallest
evils of the present tyranny is, that all such prospects are now, for a
season, overclouded. As the French themselves would say, tout est remis
en question. The forty years war, which we did think was terminated by
the final rupture with the fallen dynasty, has broken out afresh. The
prize to be contended for is still, as heretofore, whether France shall
or shall not have a constitutional government: the skeleton of absolute
monarchy has been taken from its grave, clothed once more in flesh and
blood, and re-enthroned in the Tuileries. Manuel, and Foy, and Constant,
have lived, and Edition: current; Page: [487] the martyrs of the Three
Days have died, in vain. Alas! it was the forecast of something like
this, which abridged the life and embittered the dying moments of the
most illustrious of those patriots.5

There is little novelty in the Paris intelligence of this week. The
courts martial are sitting: two persons have been tried, and
acquitted,—whether to give an air of mildness to the illegal
transaction, or, as has been surmised, because the witnesses would not
tell what they knew, before an unlawful tribunal. Two others have been
convicted, and one of them sentenced to death.6 Whether, after the
canting which the world remembers, on the occasion of a former trial, of
far greater delinquents, Louis Philippe will dare to execute the
sentence, time will disclose. Nothing is impossible; but if he take the
life of this person, let him look to his own.

MM. Chateaubriand, Hyde de Neuville, and the Duc de Fitzjames,7 have
been arrested and placed au secret. It is ridiculous to suppose that
any, especially the first, of these three men is a conspirator. That
they were named members of a Carlist Regency in nubibus, is likely
enough, and may be true without the slightest blame on their part. They
are, perhaps, of all the partisans of the exiled dynasty, the most
likely to be ostensibly put forward, and the least likely to be actually
implicated.


174.: PLEDGES [1]
 EXAMINER, 1 JULY, 1832, PP. 417-18

The final version of the Reform Bill, “A Bill to Amend the
Representation of the People in England and Wales,” 2 William IV (12
Dec., 1831), PP, 1831-32, III, 1-54, had been enacted on 7 June.
Thereafter, major campaigns to bind candidates to their constituents’
views were waged by thorough Radicals. Writing to Carlyle on 17 July,
Mill says his two articles opposing pledges (this and No. 177) are “in
very bad odour with some of our radicals”; he praises “the honest and
brave character” of Fonblanque for including them, and hints that the
circulation of the Examiner may have suffered as a result (EL, CW, Vol.
XII, pp. 112-13). Late in 1835 he makes the same comment to Tocqueville,
saying the articles “offensèrent beaucoup le public radical et lui fit
perdre plusieurs de ses abonnés,” and adding that James Mill agrees with
him (ibid., p. 288; 11 Dec.). In a note to the early Edition: current;
Page: [488] draft of his Autobiography (later excised) he admits that
the articles were ill-timed. They had been, he says, based on a mistaken
impression that the fight for democracy had now been won: “The doctrine
of these articles was right in itself, and very suitable to democratic
institutions when firmly established and rooted in the habits of the
people: then no doubt it would be wise in the electors to look out for
the most honest and most instructed men whom they could induce to
undertake the office of legislators, and refrain from binding them
beforehand to any definite measures: but I did not sufficiently consider
that the transition from bad to good institutions was only commencing”
(CW, Vol. I, p. 180n). This is the first leader in the “Political
Examiner,” headed as title. It is described in Mill’s bibliography as
“An article headed ‘Pledges’ in the Examiner of 1st July” (MacMinn, p.
21). In the Somerville College set of the Examiner, it is listed as
“Pledges” and enclosed in square brackets.

after the passing of the reform bill, the next thing to be thought of is
how to make use of it. The steed is at the door, saddled and bridled,
and it is time to mount and journey onward. The machine is in the
people’s hands, but how to work it skilfully is the question.

The people of England have acquired by their own energies, the faculty
of naming those who manage their affairs; they desire to name the
fittest men, for what have they to gain by choosing wrong? But how shall
they know who is the fittest? This leads to the question of pledges. On
that all-important question we desire to state our sentiments; uncertain
how far they will be acceptable to those who are most interested in the
matter, and certain that we shall offend many of all parties; yet firmly
convinced of the concurrence of all who understand and value the true
principles of popular representation.

We have read of few things in the annals of insincerity more offensive
to any person of the commonest moral perceptions, than the cant which
has been canted by the enemies of the popular cause, ever since the last
general election, against the exacting of pledges from candidates for
seats in Parliament. Quis tulerit Gracchos de seditione querentes?1 To
see venting a high moral indignation against the “delegates” of the
British people, men who were themselves delegates of some single
Boroughmonger, as much as his errand-boy, and much more so than his
butler or his groom; to hear men who were put into Parliament solely in
order that somebody might fatten himself and his family on the produce
of their votes, insulting the plundered nation because it also sent men
to the same place, commissioned solely to do the one thing which should
put an end to all such plunder—was past all human endurance. Ikey
Solomons inveighing against public robbers, would be the only suitable
comparison.2

On the other hand, we have seen principles avowed, and to a certain
extent acted upon, by professed Reformers, which if generally received
would put an end to the very existence of a representative government.
It is most important for Edition: current; Page: [489] the success of
the great experiment upon which we are about to enter, not to forget
what a popular government really means. The true idea of popular
representation is not that the people govern in their own persons, but
that they choose their governors. In a good government public questions
are not referred to the suffrages of the people themselves, but to those
of the most judicious persons whom the people can find. The sovereignty
of the people is essentially a delegated sovereignty. Government must be
performed by the few, for the benefit of the many: and the security of
the many consists in being governed by those who possess the largest
share of their confidence, and no longer than while that confidence
lasts.

We deem it of the utmost importance at the present unprecedented epoch
in English history, that this principle, together with the restrictions
with which it must be taken to be applicable to existing circumstances,
should be thoroughly understood and felt. We therefore urgently invite
discussion on the subject, and shall begin by stating our own opinion
upon it very fully and explicitly. We maintain that when the legislature
is properly constituted, no pledges ought in any case whatever to be
exacted from representatives: or never but in such rare and peculiar
cases, as cannot be anticipated, and probably may never occur:—That,
nevertheless, in the actual condition of Great Britain, pledges on some
subjects may be, and ought to be, exacted; solely because,
notwithstanding the Reform Bill, the Parliament is not yet properly
constituted, and will be far from securing to the affairs of the public
the best services of the best men in the nation.

The objection to pledges as an interference with the personal
independence of the candidate, is good for nothing. If his personal
independence stands in the way of his duty, he has no business there.
Nobody is obliged to be a Member of Parliament. The electors do not
impress a private gentleman as he walks the streets, and drag him
obtorto collo3 to St. Stephen’s. If he undertakes the trust, it is quite
optional, and if he cannot conscientiously perform it, his honesty is in
his own keeping; nobody wishes him to be a scoundrel; he has only to
resign. If it were really for the interest of the people that their
representatives should go to Parliament not to judge and act for the
best, but to execute a mandate already decided upon,—a man who of his
own choice seeks an office, which it is no injury to any one not to
obtain, has no right to quarrel with the conditions on which it is
bestowed.

Our disapprobation of pledges is for the sake of the constituents; the
representatives may take care of themselves.

If the House of Commons were constituted in the most perfect manner,
whom would it consist of? Surely of the wisest and best men in the
nation, or those Edition: current; Page: [490] whom the people believe
to be such. Now, if I vote for a person because I think him the wisest
man I know, am I afterwards to set myself up as his instructor, as if I
were wiser than he? The wisest men are, we suppose, wiser than any one
else. If you knew anybody wiser, why did you not choose him? If there is
nobody wiser, why set the smaller wisdom to instruct the greater? Can
you hope for more than to have your affairs managed according to the
best judgment of the best and ablest men? What is the use of hankering
after something better than the best?

Let those who, with Mr. Williams of the City of London, require a
representative to “act agreeably to the wishes and instructions of a
majority of his constituents, or resign his seat,”4 consider whether
there is not at the bottom of this a little remnant of aristocratic
vanity. Let them ask themselves whether it is not the fact, that they
have no real intention of voting for the best and wisest man. They have
no proper sense of the inappreciable value of honesty and wisdom; but
they would like exceedingly to have a rich man or a man of rank to obey
their commands, and they know that such are a kind of wild animals, who
are not to be trusted unless you have first drawn their teeth and claws.
They would rather choose a man in whom they have no confidence, so he be
rich or a lord, than the ablest and most trustworthy person in the
nation, who is no better, that is to say no richer, than themselves.

We suspect also, that the people have not yet completely found out how
much hard study it requires to make a wise legislator. A people never
understands until it has felt. Till now the English have never known
what it was to have a government in whose honesty they could confide:
and they have not yet learned what enormous mischief is capable of being
effected by mere blundering. It has been one of the qualities of our
legislature, as of all other selfish men and selfish bodies of men, that
even its blunders have almost uniformly been on the selfish side. Being
accustomed to so much selfishness, it is natural for the people to take
securities chiefly against that: and to think that they cannot tie up
the hands of their legislators too strictly. Experience must as usual be
the mother of wisdom; we must learn the value of intellect as we have
partly learnt that of honesty, by suffering for want of it. There is a
period before us, in which, peradventure, we shall have opportunity
enough to learn how wretchedly a country may be misgoverned by ignorant
good intentions.

“Wisdom cometh by opportunity of leisure.”5 No man is fit to be a
legislator whose whole life has been occupied with gaining his daily
bread by quite other pursuits. We shall never have wise legislators,
until legislation is a profession, and men study for it as any man now
studies for the business of his life. Such men, indeed, are seldom now
to be met with, and in the meantime we must be Edition: current; Page:
[491] satisfied with an approximation. Since those who have their whole
time upon their hands, have found no leisure for the systematic study of
politics, the man who has spared some one or two hours a day from his
countinghouse or his chambers for reading and reflecting on public
questions, must meet with joyful acceptance. But when the value of
knowledge is adequately felt, a man will choose his legislator as he
chooses his physician. No man pretends to instruct his physician. No man
exacts a pledge from his physician that he shall prescribe for him a
particular treatment. Nobody pretends that it is the duty of a physician
to act “according to the wishes and instructions” of his patient, or of
a majority of his patients. Why should we have one rule for the body
politic, another and an opposite one for the body natural? Politics is
an uncertain science; but so is medicine: your representative may be a
quack or an ignoramus; so may your physician. But though your physician,
or your legislator, may cheat you, it is worth while purchasing his
professional acquirements at that risk: and though he may not know every
thing, if you have chosen him wisely, he will probably know much more
than you: just as you probably know more than he does of your particular
calling or profession.

At present men’s notions are quite rational about the choice of a
physician. Nobody would endure hereditary medicine; nor would choose to
have a physician named for him by the Government, whose advice he should
be bound to take whether he would or not. But when you have chosen your
medical adviser, you let him take his own way, until you are convinced
from his ill success, or from his conversation and demeanour, that he
does not understand your case; and then you try another. We wish to see
the same rule acted upon in the choice of a Member of Parliament. It is
singular, if nobody thinks himself a better tailor than his tailor, or a
better shoemaker than his shoemaker, that yet everybody is a better
legislator than his legislator, and cannot, do what he will, find any
person who knows more about that subject that he himself.

But, how, then, it may be asked, are the people to judge of an untried
man? Very easily. Inform yourselves of his previous life—learn in what
manner his time has been spent; whether in idle dissipation, or in sober
and severe study; learn whether he has been a jobber in vestries or
corporations, or on the bench of magistrates; or an enemy of jobs:
whether he has ever stopped up a path, or set a spring gun: whether he
keeps game preserves, to decoy his poorer neighbours to their ruin.
Enquire if he ever professed liberal opinions, before it could be his
private interest to do so; if he ever professed any one opinion in
favour of anything by which he could be a loser; or if his judgment has
been always the humble servant of his interest. Find out whether he pays
his tradesmen: if he be a landlord, whether his farmers have leases, or
are kept as tenants-at-will for the sake of political power; ask if he
ever turned out a tenant for voting against him at an election; if he
keeps his farmers at a rack rent; if he has remitted his rents when they
could not be paid without encroaching upon the tenant’s Edition:
current; Page: [492] capital.—Prefer a man who has made himself known by
giving his time or his money for any patriotic object; or whose speeches
or writings, while they evince zeal for improvement and personal purity
of motive, also show that he has bestowed thought and labour on great
public questions. Next to such a person, prefer the man whom such
persons recommend. When all other things are equal, give your votes to
him who refuses to degrade himself and you by personal solicitation. To
entrust a man with a burthensome duty (unless he means to betray it) is
a compliment indeed, but no favour. The man who manifests the highest
opinion of the electors, is not he who tries to gain them over
individually by civil speeches, but he who assumes that their only
object is to choose the fittest man, and abstains from all canvassing,
except by laying his pretensions before them collectively, on the
hustings, at public meetings, or through the press.

By these and a hundred other means, it is not difficult for the people
to discern who it is that deserves enough of their confidence to be
thought worthy of a trial. We believe that these means of selection,
fairly used, would very seldom miscarry; and would generally give us a
body of representatives whom we could trust without pledges, and whose
opinion would deservedly carry weight with us, even when it was opposed
to our own; if the representative system were properly constituted.

But with a representative system so imperfect as ours still is, we stand
in need of some further security; chiefly on account of the enormity of
the seven years lease of legislation6—which removes the sense of
responsibility to such a distance as to be evanescent; gives the people
no opportunity till it is too late, of correcting a first error; and
gives time even for highly deserving persons to degenerate and become
corrupt, from what has corrupted so many men, the long enjoyment of
power.

Till short parliaments are restored, no representatives, however chosen,
upon such imperfect knowledge as the electors can possibly have of them
before trial, are to be depended upon for fidelity to their trust. If at
suitable intervals they had to render an account of their acts after
performance, it would be unnecessary to fetter them before. A liberal
confidence should be, and naturally will be, given to a faithful
trustee, to execute the trust according to his own judgment: but if he
has time to ruin you long before it is in your power to get rid of him,
you will trust him with nothing that you can by possibility keep in your
own hands. A man who is his own physician, generally has a fool for his
patient; but it is better that he prescribe for himself, than obey a
physician whom he believes to have been bribed by his heir.

A pledge therefore should be exacted from every popular candidate, for
Edition: current; Page: [493] shortening the duration of parliaments:
and for any other measures, if they be so urgent that they cannot safely
wait till after the repeal of the septennial act.

As a general rule, we would lay it down that pledges are allowable where
there is a demand for changes in the constitution, or where, from any
cause whatever, the people feel themselves obliged to choose an unfit
man.

Of the propriety of changes in the constitution, the only proper judges
are the people themselves. The trustee is to judge how he can best
discharge his trust, but not upon what terms it is to be confided to
him. It would be absurd that the members of the legislature should
determine the conditions of their own power. The very supposition that a
constitutional change can be necessary, implies that the present
governors are not the best men, or that the system is not such as to
secure their best services. Either way their judgment is not to be
relied on, and least of all in what so nearly affects themselves.
Whoever, therefore, on mature deliberation, with the proper means of
knowledge, has made up his mind that the ballot, or annual parliaments,
or any other change in the composition of the legislature, is desirable,
cannot be blamed for annexing to the promise of his vote a stipulation
for supporting these measures.

So again if the people are unable to find a really qualified candidate:
which will doubtless be the case in many instances, and for a long time
to come. Reform or no reform, the people must in fact continue to make
their selection chiefly from a very narrow class; the class possessed of
leisure, that is to say, of considerable property. Even of that class
the majority are for the present disqualified by a rooted aversion to
popular institutions; and the remainder too often by confirmed
indolence; incapacity for mental exertion; a life spent in mere
amusement, instead of any manly pursuit; ignorance of the world and of
business, and a consequent timidity which makes them shrink from
difficulty or responsibility instead of facing it bravely. Yet such will
frequently be the persons in whose hands the electoral bodies must be
fain to place their affairs, until the working of a free government
shall have inspired our opulent classes with the ambition of earning
honours by deserving them. For, as long as one of the highest and most
arduous services which man can render to man, that of making laws for
him to obey, shall be almost the only service which goes unremunerated,
except by jobbing or underhand methods; as long as no indemnity is
allowed to legislators for the value of their time, and, unless they are
already rich, they have only to choose between corrupt gains and painful
sacrifices; so long government will not be carried on by the wisest and
best men. In France the case is somewhat different: for in France narrow
circumstances are only an inconvenience, not a disgrace: a man who has
but two rooms to live in, may enjoy as much respect, and may even, in
those two rooms, receive as much of the best society of the capital, as
if he lived in a palace. But here, while the income which is esteemed
necessary to respectability is so great as few can inherit, and as
scarcely any one can earn without devoting to that sordid pursuit
Edition: current; Page: [494] every moment of his life; and while it
requires the heroism of an Andrew Marvel,7 to maintain dignity of
character in honourable poverty,—there will certainly be many
representatives, in every parliament, whom it would be ridiculous to
treat as if they were wiser, or even half so wise, as the general public
when its opinion is deliberately formed. To such persons very strict
instructions may properly be given. But it should be ever present to the
mind both of the candidates and of the electors, that the exaction of
pledges is always a testimony of the extreme unfitness of the
representative. It is either a proof that no fit person is to be found,
or it implies the disgraceful supposition, that the electors, having fit
persons at command, prefer such as they themselves believe to be unfit.


175.: LEWIN’S THE FISHERMAN OF FLAMBOROUGH HEAD
 EXAMINER, 8 JULY, 1832, P. 435

Charlotte Lewin (1796-1875), a devotee of vocal music who collaborated
with Mill’s friend Hickson, was the sister of Harriet Grote (1792-1878),
who, with her husband, George, played a large part in Mill’s life from
the early 1820s. This review, in the “Literary Examiner,” is headed:
“The Fisherman of Flamborough Head, now living at the age of
Seventy-four. Collected from personal knowledge, during a visit to the
East Riding of Yorkshire. By C— L—. Oliphant, Edinburgh; and Nisbet,
London. [1832.]” It is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A short
notice of Miss Charlotte Lewin’s account of a Fisherman at Flamborough
Head in the Examiner of 8th July 1832” (MacMinn, p. 22). In the
Somerville College set of the Examiner, it is listed as “Notice of ‘The
Fisherman of Flamborough Head’ ” and enclosed in square brackets.

this is an account of one of those examples of a life of admirable
virtue in the very humblest station, which, though not common, are far
more so than is usually supposed, being seldom known beyond the circle
of a narrow neighbourhood. The fair author of this little publication
has the merit not only of an interesting literary composition, but, what
is still better, of a good action: it was written and published in the
hope of contributing to the relief of the excellent person who is the
subject of it, and whose old age and infirmities now almost disable him
from earning his livelihood.1 From saving he has been prevented by
duties of self-imposed beneficence. In that same hope we now call the
attention of our readers to this short history of his life, and would
gladly, if we could, Edition: current; Page: [495] induce the whole
world to profit by it; for there are none who might not, either in the
way of sympathy or of example.


176.: FRENCH NEWS [66]
 EXAMINER, 8 JULY, 1832, P. 440

For the entry in Mill’s bibliography, see No. 116. The item, headed
“London, July 8, 1832,” is listed as “Article on France” and enclosed in
square brackets in the Somerville College set of the Examiner.

the prisoners condemned by the courts martial, for participation in the
late insurrection at Paris, have appealed to the supreme law authority
of France, the Court of Cassation, which has quashed all the sentences,
and declared the trial of non-military persons, before military
tribunals, to be illegal.1

This is a noble triumph for the cause of legal government; and goes far
to undo the mischief which the late illegal measures had done.

Laws and a Constitution do yet exist in France. Though the executive
disregards them, there is a power above the executive, which recals the
executive to its duty; and whose admonition the King does not think
himself strong enough to disregard.

The next day an ordonnance appeared, by which the “siege” of Paris was
raised.2 It is affirmed that the Chambers will be convened for the 25th
of the present month. The present ministry remain in office till the
meeting of the Chambers. If they remain for a single week afterwards, a
government of law is not valued in France as it is here, and should be
every where.

MM. Chateaubriand, Hyde de Neuville, and Fitz-James, have been set at
liberty; the chambre des mises en accusation (analogous to our grand
jury) found that there was no ground for proceeding against them.3 M.
Ledieu, one of the journalists who had been arrested, has been
dismissed, because there was actually no charge against him.4

Immediately after the authority of the law was restored, the three
deputies against whom warrants had been issued (MM. Garnier-Pagès,
Cabet, and Laboissière) delivered themselves up to justice.5

Attempts have been made to strengthen the ministry by taking in M. de
Edition: current; Page: [496] Talleyrand, M. Dupin, or M. Thiers:6 but
the first, and wiliest of the three, is understood to have refused, and
with the others it was not found possible to make terms.


177.: PLEDGES [2]
 EXAMINER, 15 JULY, 1832, PP. 449-51

For the context, see the first part, No. 174. Mill’s observations had
been contested in the Morning Chronicle, 10 July, 1832, pp. 2-3, by John
Black, to whom he now replies. Like No. 174, this is a first leader,
headed as title. It is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A sec.
article headed ‘Pledges,’ in the Exam. of 15th July 1832” (MacMinn, p.
22). In the Somerville College set of the Examiner, it is listed as
“Pledges” and enclosed in square brackets.

we have been surprised to find from an article in the Morning Chronicle
of Tuesday, that the editor of that journal dissents wholly from the
observations on the subject of Pledges in our last paper but one. It is
from no deficiency of respect towards our excellent contemporary, or
disposition to undervalue the great help he has rendered to the common
cause, that we profess our inability to see anything in the arguments
which he has brought against us, worthy either of himself or of the
gravity of the subject. They have not even, as is usual with him, the
appearance of being drawn from a matured and strong conviction, but
rather resemble the first crude outpourings of a mind to which Thought,
on the great questions of government, is new and unfamiliar. We learn at
least one thing from our contemporary’s article; how much need there was
and is, that the elementary and fundamental truths of politics should be
frequently brought forward and insisted upon; for they have been kept
out of view until they seem strange and unfashionable, and, if they
remain longer in the background, are in positive danger of being
forgotten. And in particular we see that it was high time to speak a few
reasonable words on this subject of Pledges; when opinions so remote
from all we deem true and useful, are professed even as axioms in
politics, not by the unthinking vulgar of any rank, which would be less
surprising, but by a public writer who has claims much higher than most
men to be placed in the class of philosophic reformers.

We shall put first in order a few explanations, necessary to prevent
ourselves from being misunderstood.

We acknowledge, as we did most fully in our preceding article, that the
Edition: current; Page: [497] immediate application of the true
principle of Representative Government, is complicated with a number of
considerations arising from the surviving evil consequences of the
vicious system under which we have hitherto lived. The state of society
and manners in Great Britain almost compels the electors to make their
selection from persons in whom it would not be natural that they should
confide; persons to a great degree corrupted by aristocratic
institutions. The leisured class, the class which ought to furnish
statesmen and philosophers, has been bred in a very different school,
and trained to far other occupations. The circumstances of their
education were not such as to make them love wisdom or virtue for its
own sake; and in the pursuit of power or distinction, both the one and
the other were rather obstructions than helps. For a legislator, the
sole qualification required was having bought the office, or being born
to it; even in a minister, talents for government meant nothing but
address in finding a colour for benefiting the few at the cost of the
many, and in quieting the exorbitance of those among the few who
demanded more than their share. Capacity for government, in any sense
implying the good of the governed, was to such a degree unknown and
unthought of, that the tradition of its having ever existed, and the
opinion of its being required, were gradually dying away, and are all
but absolutely extinct.

The evils of centuries are not to be remedied in a day. Great statesmen
cannot be called out of the ground by stamping upon it.1 But there are
still some men wiser than others. And let us here clearly understand
whether this, among other things, is to be contested. Are all men
possessed of an equal quantity of political knowledge and political
foresight, aye or no? Let us have a categorical answer to this one
question. If the Morning Chronicle, or any one else, maintains the
affirmative, he shall hear further from us. But, for the present, we
take it for granted, that according to the old proverb, “some are wise,
and some are otherwise.” Now, all we contend for, all we have ever
contended for, is, that the people ought to have the benefit of having
their affairs managed by the wise, rather than by those who are
otherwise. We will join with any one who pleases in deploring that the
wise are not more wise, and shall be happy to unite with all the world
in making both it and ourselves as wise as our faculties and
opportunities will permit. Still, we return to our original position;
there may be a wiser government in the moon, perhaps, than the
government of the wisest persons that can be had, but how, in the name
of reason, is it to be got at? Shall we mend the matter by setting a
less wisdom to dictate to a greater? And, mind, we do not, like the
Tories, first inculcate the necessity of wisdom, then quietly assume
that a long purse is wisdom, and conclude for the government of the
longest purse. There shall be no question between us and the people as
to who is wisest; we will have no other arbiter of the matter than
themselves: for our present purpose the Edition: current; Page: [498]
wisest are whomsoever the people consider such; we own the people, not
certainly as infallible judges, but as the only safe ones, and submit to
them not from a blind confidence, but from the motive which we ourselves
urge, namely, that they are the best that can be had. We only say, let
them judge of the workman both before and after, but let them not
attempt to teach him the way of his work. They are employing skilled
labour; and they cannot as a body be more skilled than the most skilful
labourer whom they have it in their power to choose.

In this, however, we are always supposing that a skilful and honest
labourer is to be had. We acknowledge that the case is altered, when the
people either cannot choose a sufficient person to serve them in
Parliament, or will not.

While the office of a member of Parliament is unpaid, and while even
those who have something, cannot be content without making it more,
there will be a great reluctance among men of abilities to offer
themselves for the people’s suffrages, unless they are already in what
are called independent, that is, in affluent, circumstances. Now all
such persons lie under a prima facie suspicion of sympathizing more
strongly with the aristocracy than with the mass of the people. It ought
never to be believed without the most positive experience, of any
English gentleman, that the interests and feelings of gentlemen do not
count with him for more than their just value, and the interests and
feelings of all the other members of the community for less. There are
different degrees of this caste-spirit, but those who have least of it
in reality will not be the most confident and eager in their disclaimer
of it. As the feelings proper to a free government gain the strength
which time and habit alone can give, these wrongful partialities will
wear away. But in the meantime they are to be presumed, and guarded
against, in almost every case: and every candidate who cannot
effectually rebut the presumption, is so far wanting in one of the most
essential ingredients of a just title to that confidence, which, some
time hence, all the representatives of the people will habitually
deserve.

There is also another very important concession to be made. In general
the people are better judges of men than of measures; naturally: since
we commonly judge of men from past experience, of measures from what is
so much more uncertain, prospective anticipation. But now, in some
particulars, the case is reversed; there being various measures which,
from long and earnest discussion, and the little difficulty of the
subjects, the people have come to a tolerably correct understanding of;
while in respect to men, the old bad habits which grew up under the
exploded system, still subsist, and the fitness of a man is judged by a
wrong criterion. This will partly account for the reluctance which we
have seen evinced by some persons whom we greatly respect, to admit the
true principle on the subject of pledges, as applicable to the present
time. It is felt, justly enough, that any pledges which the people are
disposed, just now, to exact, are mostly such as almost any candidate
well affected to the popular cause could conscientiously give, while yet
the same electors, if called upon to point out the man whom they think
properest in the abstract to represent them in Parliament, Edition:
current; Page: [499] would probably name the greatest landholder in the
neighbourhood, if they are satisfied with his personal manners, and
kindness as a landlord or a magistrate; though, perhaps, every act of
his Parliamentary life might be hostile to their cause.

These are the considerations which can alone lead us to view with
complacency the copious exaction of pledges which is taking place at
this period. We regard it as a palliative for the consequences of a
vicious state of mind both in the electors and in the candidates. As
long as the personal prepossessions of the electors are in favour of the
richest rather than of the ablest and most honest candidate, and as long
as nine-tenths of the candidates may be suspected of being at heart
insincere, or at least but cold, reformers, so long we must tolerate or
approve the chaining up of the representative by much tighter bonds than
would be allowable, if it were easier finding unexceptionable men, or if
the people knew better how to distinguish them. If, therefore, we could
think of any pledge to be tendered to a candidate, his acceptance or
refusal of which would decide whether he is with us or against
us,—whether he is for the Movement or the Resistance,—whether he voted
for the Reform Bill as a prop to all our remaining institutions, or as a
means of beating down such of them as are bad, and repairing such as are
decaying,—we should not be averse to see such a test propounded. But,
unhappily, there is no single question, nor small number of questions,
which places this point out of doubt. The Ballot, or the Taxes on
Knowledge,2 perhaps come nearest to a test, but not near enough. It
cannot, however, be pretended that a man’s spontaneous professions, the
style of his addresses, his own previous character and that of his
leading supporters, commonly leave any doubt as to the main direction of
his politics. We may be sure it will seldom be uncertain who is the
Conservative, and who the Reforming candidate; or who is the most in
earnest of two professed reformers. But if there should be any doubt,
this is what justifies us in requiring pledges; this is the point which
our pledges should be shaped to ascertain; and we should endeavour to
ascertain it with the least possible restraint upon the discretion of
the man whom we are employing to judge for us as well as to act.

The exaction of pledges should be felt as a slur upon the candidate; a
slur which should never be inflicted except where it is deserved. When
the pledge is not a slur upon the candidate, its exaction is a slur upon
the electors; to be justified only if the electors are in reality bad
judges of the fittest man.

Thus much by way of explanation and enforcement of our own opinion. We
must now have a few words with the Morning Chronicle.

Our contemporary has very needlessly confounded two ideas, than which it
is Edition: current; Page: [500] difficult to conceive any more
perfectly distinct; he has supposed that because we object to tying up
the representative from acting upon his own opinions, we must therefore
be against asking him any questions about them. So remote is this from
our sentiments, that we should regard any candidate, who did not
explicitly state his present opinion without reserve or disguise, on any
political question on which his constituents desired to know it, as
disqualified by that single circumstance from being a good Member of
Parliament. Because we feel the superiority of matured wisdom, does it
follow that we are enemies to discussion? Because we think another man
wiser than ourselves, does it follow that we think ourselves fools, and
deem that he can learn nothing by talking over the subject with us? Let
him tell us his own opinions and hear ours; but let us as well as him,
hold and declare our opinions with becoming modesty; let us not suppose
that we know everything and he nothing, because we happen to be the
electors and he the candidate. By a free communication we may learn much
from him, and he something from us: he will moreover learn the public
opinion for the time being, which as a fact it is most important that he
should know, howsoever as a rule of conduct it may occasionally be
improper that he should be guided by it. “But,” it is said, “if the
candidate is to tell all his opinions, this will be tantamount to
exacting pledges.” We answer, no doubt it will, with all electors who
are so narrow-minded and conceited, as to judge of a man’s intellect and
virtue by the single test of his agreeing in opinion with themselves:
but this is the very thing which we are contending that they ought not
to do: we are maintaining that they ought to choose somebody whose
opinion, if sincere, is more likely to be right than their own: and that
it is only if they cannot find such a person, that they ought to send
somebody as a mere instrument to execute their own decree: just as it is
sometimes necessary to send instructions to a General or an Admiral how
and when to fight; but only when he deserves to be superseded, and you
have no means of immediately supplying his place.

The Chronicle does not well know what to do with our illustration of
choosing a physician; he has found out fifty differences between the two
cases, every one of which is altogether beside the purpose. He says that
the patient cannot always understand the physician’s reasons! And can
the citizen always understand the legislator’s reasons? Are all
questions of legislation, then, so extremely simple? As is forcibly
remarked by the Times, (whose powerful co-operation on this subject
gives us much pleasure), what shall we say to the poor-laws, or the
currency, or the mode of reforming the law, or the mode of reforming the
Courts of Justice, or emigration, or the law of primogeniture, or the
best principle of taxation, all subjects on which thinking and honest
men are divided in opinion?3 Does it follow that a question is really
simple, because the electors may happen to think it so? All questions
appear simple while they are looked at only on one Edition: current;
Page: [501] side. But though we cannot always judge of either the
physician’s reasons, or the legislator’s, it is always advisable to hear
them. Though we may not know much about the matter ourselves, we may
generally give a shrewd guess from what a man says, whether he is
speaking of a subject which he understands, or one which he is ignorant
of. A wise man will have nothing to do either with a physician, or a
representative, who conceals the principles of his treatment.
Concealment is the refuge of quackery; a manly avowal is one of the
signs both of true knowledge and of integrity.

The Chronicle also finds out that a physician differs from a legislator,
because a physician has only to satisfy his patient, but a legislator
the whole nation. One would think our contemporary was speaking of an
actor, or a rope-dancer. The physician has not to satisfy his patient,
he has to cure him. No doubt, if satisfaction were all, every man knows
best what will satisfy him. But medicine, and government, are not a mere
affair of taste. The reason why wisdom is required, either in a
physician or a legislator, is because what satisfies a man to-day is not
always best for his interest to-morrow. And why, because a nation’s good
is at stake instead of a single person’s, the nation should not be
guided by the same maxim of common sense which the individual members of
it follow in every analogous case, our contemporary has not succeeded in
shewing us.

But all this is nothing to what follows. The Chronicle next gives us his
notion of a Representative Government. He says it is by the vote of each
member, voting as the mere organ of his constituents, that we collect
the opinion of the majority, and ensure the conformity of the acts of
government to the general will. This is a step beyond Robespierre’s
democratic constitution of 1793; for in that, although all laws were
referred to the express sanction of the electors after they were passed,
the electors were not consulted first, and each legislator gave his
provisional vote according to the best of his judgment.4 If even this
latitude is not to be allowed to a representative, we cannot see much
use in the complex machinery of a representation. If the power of
changing your representative every three years, or even every year, does
not suffice you, but, in order that you may feel secure, the advantages
of knowledge and deliberation must be sacrificed, government by a select
body be given up, and government by the people en masse introduced, then
it would be cheaper, more certain, and more expeditious for the electors
to send their votes to town on every measure, under an official frank,
through the post-office. A few clerks would then suffice to do the
business of Parliament, and all danger of jobbing or encroachment on the
part of the legislature would be effectually provided against. Nothing
short of this will do. You will never be quite safe from Scylla till you
are whirling round in the midst of Charybdis. You will always be in some
danger of striking against the wall of rock on your right, till you have
fallen down the precipice on your left.

Edition: current; Page: [502]
For our part, we avow, that when the Tory prints accused the Reformers
of seeking to set up a government of mere numbers, instead of one of
intelligence, our denial of the imputation was sincere. Such never was
our object. A government of honesty and intelligence was all we sought,
and our quarrel with the old government was, that its character was the
very reverse. We know that the will of the people, even of the numerical
majority, must in the end be supreme, for as Burke says, it would be
monstrous that any power should exist capable of permanently defying
it:5 but in spite of that, the test of what is right in politics is not
the will of the people, but the good of the people, and our object is,
not to compel but to persuade the people to impose, for the sake of
their own good, some restraints on the immediate and unlimited exercise
of their own will. One of our reasons for desiring a popular government
was, that men whom the people themselves had selected for their wisdom
and good affections, would have authority enough to withstand the will
of the people when it is wrong. And it is surely some presumption that
the people are in the wrong, if they cannot find any man of ability who
will do as they wish him, without being pledged to it. We ourselves do
not think that the public opinion, except where it has adhered to the
impressions of early education, has often gone far wrong heretofore; but
this is because the people have for the most part acted upon our
principle, and have not yet learnt the doctrine that they are to hear
appeals on all subjects, from the decision of the most competent judges.
We must recollect, however, that the people are now the sovereign: as
such, it is they who will now be the objects of flattery; it is to them
that the interested, the discontented, and the impatient, will
henceforth carry their complaints. Every factious minority, every
separate class, every adventurer who seeks to rise by undermining those
above him, will endeavour to obtain, not as before from the oligarchy,
but from the people, what has been refused by the people’s
representatives: and the grand instrument of success will be, persuading
the people, that no thought, no study, no labour, give any superiority
in judging of public measures, and that the question immediately on the
tapis, whatever it be, no matter how complicated, is level to every
man’s capacity. Where the popular mind is not kept steady by confidence
in superior wisdom, these tactics will frequently succeed. The man who
says, Judge for yourself, you are wise enough, has an immense advantage
over him who can only say, I speak from study and experience, and I know
better than you. An ignoramus in politics may deem lightly of this
danger; all things appear easy to him, because he sees little in them,
and cannot conceive that anything is to be seen, except what he can see.
But a man who has thought and read as much as the Editor of the
Chronicle, must know that the correct view of a political question is
very often not the superficial one.

Edition: current; Page: [503]
We here conclude for the present our answer to the Chronicle. We have
heard ourselves assailed by another objection, from which, to his
credit, the writer in the Chronicle has abstained; that our doctrine is
untimely. Untimely! why? Because this is a good opportunity for
extorting by means of pledges a great number of good measures. According
to this doctrine, we ought to withhold what we deem the truth, until by
the production of it we can serve our immediate ends; to make our profit
of error as long as we can, and first turn against it when it turns
against ourselves. With what face could we shew ourselves before the
public, or what opinion could we expect them to entertain of our
sincerity, if we countenanced the practice of unlimited pledges now when
it suits our convenience, and found out its impropriety only when it
came to be put in force against our own opinions? Let those act upon
such principles who relish them; they shall not be ours. We have never
been able to discover any better or more universal maxim of expediency,
than honesty, nor know we any occasion upon which the truth is untimely,
if it is the truth, and not merely a little bit of the truth, worse than
no truth at all. But if there be a time which is fittest of all for
combatting errors, it is before they have strengthened into prejudices;
and the best of occasions for putting forth the truth, is when it must
be seen that we propound it because it is the truth, though something
else, it might seem, would better serve our immediate turn. We may add
too, that there are few persons from whom the objection to pledges can
come with a better grace than from ourselves, since perhaps no pledge
has yet been called for, by any considerable portion of the people, in
favour of any measures but such as we in the main approve.

Not that we shall in reality carry these measures a day sooner, by
violating for them the true principles of a representative government.
They are all of them such as the people are sure to obtain, if they
choose thorough reformers; and we have already allowed the utmost
latitude of pledging, if you are obliged to choose men whom you do not
know to be thorough reformers. If the pledges now proposed were to be
the last ever asked, we should be as strong advocates of them as any
one, for they accord with our own opinions: but how is a practice to be
kept within due limits? Surely no otherwise than by pointing out, as
often as the subject engages public attention, what the due limits are.
It is the part of wisdom to look after as well as before; and not to let
those doctrines and feelings which are the only permanent securities for
good government, be played away for the mere stake of the moment. Once
gone, they are not so easily recovered. And when able men have wandered
so far from them as we now see, truly it was not too soon to put in our
caveat for the established truths.

We did not expect that our view of the subject would find favour with
the unreflecting; not because there was anything abstruse, or refined,
or paradoxical, in it, for it was the broad common-sense view, which
strikes a man of plain understanding as soon as the question is placed
before him. But we were exhorting men to two things, either of which is
more than a great number of Edition: current; Page: [504] persons are
capable of; to doubt their own infallibility, and to forego an exercise
of power.

It was for this reason; it was because we knew the formidable array of
human weaknesses and passions which would be perpetually at work to make
a Representative Democracy (what it has so often been asserted to be in
its own essence) a mere mob-government; that we deemed it necessary thus
early to call upon the intelligent leaders of the people that they might
join in stemming the torrent before it becomes irresistible. And it
disappoints and mortifies us that one who ranks so high among those
leaders as the Editor of the Morning Chronicle, one who has done more in
a few short years to extirpate abuses than any other periodical writer
whatever, should have given the sanction of his authority to the most
deplorable misapprehension of the nature of representative government,
which can possibly prevail; an error of which the Tories have always
delighted to accuse the reformers, but which we would gladly have
believed that not one of the enlightened reformers really held, and
which the Editor of the Chronicle may live to deplore his having ever,
even for a moment, countenanced by the weight of his authority.

We wind up by a summary of the conclusions of our former article.

Pledges may be exacted for all organic, in other words, all
constitutional, changes; such as the Ballot, and Triennial Parliaments:—

Also for all measures of immediate urgency, which cannot conveniently
wait for the repeal of the septennial act:—

And finally, if the electors are obliged to choose a candidate of
doubtful judgment, or of doubtful affections, any pledges may be taken,
which they in their suspicion may deem necessary.

In all other cases, pledges ought not to be required.


178.: FRENCH NEWS [67]
 EXAMINER, 15 JULY, 1832, P. 456

For the entry in Mill’s bibliography, see No. 116. The item, headed
“London, July 15, 1832,” is listed as “Article on France” and enclosed
in square brackets in the Somerville College set of the Examiner.

we have great pleasure in calling the attention of our readers to an
article on the state of France, which has just appeared in the
Westminster Review. It is obviously of French origin, and bears marks of
the hand to which it is ascribed, one of the most enlightened and
high-minded of patriots.1 We are proud to find Edition: current; Page:
[505] in this retrospective view of the history of parties in France,
the confirmation (with many additional particulars) of all that was
written in this journal on French politics in the few months succeeding
the Revolution in July.

We learn from the Paris correspondent of the Chronicle, that a
half-penny paper for the people is about to be started at Paris, under
the auspices of Laffitte, Odilon-Barrot, and Arago, (the leaders of the
moderate Opposition) whose names appear in the prospectus;2 and under
the gratuitous editorship of M. Cauchois-Lemaire, one of the ablest and
most independent of the political writers of the day. The price will
just cover the stamp duty to Government,—all the other expenses will be
defrayed by subscription. A noble employment of wealth and talents, from
which we augur the happiest consequences. These are the true Penny
Magazines3 for this age of politics; all others, though not absolutely
useless, are secondary in usefulness, and less than secondary as
instruments of power.

The French Ministry has issued a precious circular to the different
Procureurs du Roi, ordering a still more strenuous persecution of the
newspaper press.4 Censure of the mere acts of the Government is to be
permitted; but every body who professes, even as a speculative opinion,
that a republic, or the restoration of the exiled family, would be
desirable, is to be prosecuted. As the first fruits of this increase of
“vigour,” several newspapers have been seized, and the Moniteur has been
so obliging as to announce officially what are the exceptionable
passages. In one case, that of the Tribune, the crime was publishing a
list of subscriptions, in which one of the subscribers signs himself “A
Good Republican,” another “An Enemy of Kings,” and a third “An Enemy of
all Monarchs since the death of Napoleon.”5 This is the fifty-sixth
prosecution of this one journal since the July Revolution. Truly the
heroes of the barricades threw their lives away to some purpose.

The chambers are not to be summoned immediately. The King and his
miserable Ministry are afraid to meet them.

In the meanwhile, the Government is weeding the public offices of the
few remaining patriots, whom it had not hitherto ventured to touch.

September 1832 to August 1833


179.: RECOMMENDATIONS OF CANDIDATES TO PARLIAMENT
 EXAMINER, 2 SEPT., 1832, P. 569

This article is prompted by the candidacy in the Radical interest of
some of Mill’s acquaintances in the elections for the first post-Reform
Parliament. The unheaded article is described in Mill’s bibliography as
“Recommendations of several candidates for seats in Parliament in the
Exam. of 20 Sept. 1832. (Some were not mine. Mine were J. & E. Romilly,
C. Buller, T.H. Lloyd, Hyde Villiers, Hutt, Hawkins, and W.H. Ord.)”
(MacMinn, p. 22.) In the set of the Examiner in Somerville College, it
is listed as “Recommendations of several candidates to Parliament,” with
the relevant portions enclosed in square brackets, and two corrections
indicated: at 508.4 “Love” is altered to “Looe”; and at 508.19
“districts, at” is altered to “districts. At”. Probably Albany
Fonblanque, the editor of the Examiner, who wrote most of the material
in the paper, was responsible for the paragraphs not here included, that
is, the opening three (a first paragraph rejoicing that there are
candidates of intellectual attainments, a recommendation of Grote for a
City of London seat, and a note of regret that Birkbeck was too unwell
to stand for Finsbury) and three interspersed with Mill’s (Bulwer for
Lincoln, Roebuck for Bath, and Davenport Hill for Hull). One cannot, of
course, infer that Mill disapproved of these.

bridport.—The patriotic electors of this place are expected to return,
(along with the present valuable member Mr. Warburton) Mr. John
Romilly,1 second son of the late Sir Samuel Romilly. They could not have
found a more courageous or a more enlightened reformer, or a person more
devoted, through good and evil report to the people’s cause. To this it
should be added, that Mr. Romilly, though a professional lawyer, and
practising in the most defective of all our law courts, the Court of
Chancery, is yet among the warmest friends of a radical and systematic
Law Reform.

ludlow.—In this stronghold of the Clive Family, Mr. Edward Romilly, a
worthy participator in his brother’s opinions and purposes, is said to
be certain of prevailing over the nominee of the Boroughmonger.2

Edition: current; Page: [508]
liskeard.—The inhabitants of this borough, which is in Schedule B, and
was a pocket borough of the St. Germain’s family are about to do
themselves great honour by electing Mr. Charles Buller, nephew of Mr.
Buller, of Morval, lately the patron of the (now happily disfranchised)
borough of West Looe.3 Mr. Charles Buller is not one of those sprigs of
Toryism who have only become reformers since it was no longer their
interest to be otherwise. He has always been a reformer, and his
disinterested adherence to the people’s cause under circumstances of
great temptation, could not fail to recommend him to the suffrages of
any of the reformed constituencies. He was brought into Parliament early
in the Wellington administration by his family, whose ministerial
influence together with his own talents, might easily have obtained for
him place and favour, but he resisted all allurements, and would not
compromise his independence. After the retirement of the Duke of
Wellington, Mr. C. Buller was one of the minority of five or six who
voted with Mr. Hume, against the increase of the army.4 In the interval
between Earl Grey’s accession to power, and the introduction of the
reform bill, Mr. C. Buller published one of the ablest of the pamphlets
in favour of reform, in which he proposed a plan, still more extensive
than that, afterwards adopted by the ministry, including the ballot, and
a new division of the country, into electoral districts.5 At the general
elections he lost his seat, for having voted for the bill. His support,
both by word and vote, will certainly be given to all measures of
enlightened reform.

lymington.—In this borough, the liberal candidate is Mr. Hyde Villiers,
a member of the present government, but deserving of support from all
reformers, especially when opposed as he is at present, only by Tory
candidates. He is one of the most valuable of the young and rising
official men; his opinions are in accordance with the spirit of the age,
and the nation is likely to be well served by him, both in Parliament
and in office. Mr. Villiers also, was one of the members of the last
Parliament, who voted for the disfranchisement of his family borough,
and lost his seat in consequence.

stockport.—We know of no candidate for the new Parliament, more
deserving the support of all true reformers, than Mr. J.H. Lloyd, one of
the Edition: current; Page: [509] candidates for this place, well known
as a rising commercial lawyer, a thorough reformer in the fullest extent
of the term, long before reform seemed likely to be accomplished in our
own times, and well capable of supporting the popular cause, not only as
a voter, but as a speaker.6

hull.—Mr. William Hutt, a candidate for this important place, is, though
a young man, an old and genuine reformer.7

newport.—(Isle of Wight).—This patriotic place is about to return two
highly meritorious members to Parliament; Mr. Hawkins, whose speeches on
reform, the public will not soon forget, and who was thrown out of his
family borough, because he voted for its disfranchisement; and Mr. W.H.
Ord, (son of Mr. Ord, the member for Morpeth), whom we can certify to
have been, in the worst times, an honest and enlightened reformer.8

 EXAMINER, 9 SEPT., 1832, P. 585

After making a three-week walking tour (19 July to 6 Aug.) and then
writing three major essays (“Corporation and Church Property,” “Austin’s
Lectures on Jurisprudence,” and “On Genius”) and No. 179, Mill returns
in this article to French affairs, with further comment on his
Saint-Simonian friends and the trial of Carrel, soon to be taken by Mill
as the model of a radical publicist. Writing to Carlyle, who shared his
interest in the Saint-Simonians, on 17 Sept., he summarizes the article
in a gossipy fashion, and mentions it again to him on 22 Oct. (EL, CW,
Vol. XII, pp. 119-20, 125). The article, headed “London, September 9,
1832,” is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A summary of French
affairs in the Examiner of 9th September 1832” (MacMinn, p. 22). In the
Somerville College set of the Examiner, it is listed as “Article on
France” and enclosed in square brackets.

the head of the st. simonian sect, and two of its principal members,
have been sentenced to a year’s imprisonment and a fine.1 This
contemptible mode of putting down speculative opinions has been treated
by the liberal press, both here Edition: current; Page: [510] and in
France, as it deserves. The Times, it is true, with the ingrained
vulgarity which so constantly distinguishes it even when advocating a
right cause, recommends “ducking in a horsepond” as a substitute for
fine and imprisonment.2 For our part, if the base and brutal propensity
to illtreat those who think differently from us is to be indulged, we
had rather that the operation, like the rest of the dirty work of
society, should be executed by rule, and by a hired officer, than that
the hands or the souls of the people themselves should be contaminated
with it.

With regard to the St. Simonians, the strange attitude which their
leaders have assumed since the retirement to Ménilmontant, is of itself
enough to prevent any further good or harm that could have arisen from
their exertions.3 En France c’est le ridicule qui tue, has often been
said: and if the St. Simonians have been kept alive till now, it is
because they have never till now been actually and truly ridiculous. We
hope better things yet from several of them. Of their doctrines we still
think, what we have in a measure stated, more than once,—that there is,
out of all reckoning, more truth and substance in them than in any other
of the numerous Utopian systems which are afloat. We agree in but few of
their conclusions, yet we see an undeniable and permanent value in many
of their premises; and we venture to assure any person who may desire to
know more of them, that he must be either very wise or very foolish if
he can read their writings without getting rid of many errors, and
gaining a clearer insight into various important truths.

The editor of the National has been tried on a capital charge, for an
article published just before the insurrection, and construed as an act
of participation in it.4 He has been acquitted not only of the capital,
but of the minor, offence. The trial was most interesting. General
Pajol, who commanded the military on the 5th and 6th of June, was called
as a witness for the defence. One of his own official reports was shown
to him, in which he informed the Government that the conflict commenced
on the part of the troops; who attacked the people merely because an
attempt was made to change the course of the procession, in order to
carry Lamarque’s remains to the Pantheon.5 General Pajol acknowledged
the authenticity of the document; but, when the counsel for the defence
attempted to interrogate him upon the truth of the statement which it
contained, the public Edition: current; Page: [511] prosecutor objected,
and the Court interfered, declaring that a witness could not be
compelled to give publicity to the communications he might have made to
the Government in the course of his duty.6

This is a curious specimen of the French law of evidence, which, indeed,
is of a piece with the French law and practice in most other points; the
rule there is, that all is fair in favour of the Government, and nothing
against it. However, we think few will draw from the refusal of the
Crown lawyer to allow General Pajol to confirm his own official
statement, any inference but that the statement was true, and known by
the Government to be such. If so, what condemnation can be too severe
for the acharnement with which the Government pursues all who took part
in a struggle, in which the military were the aggressors?

It will be remembered that warrants were issued against three deputies,
MM. Garnier-Pagès (President of the Aide-toi Society), Cabet, and
Laboissière, who refused to stand their trial before a court-martial,
but surrendered as soon as the decree of the Court of Cassation had
restored the course of law.7 The Chambre des mises en accusation, a
court exercising the functions of our grand jury, has set these
gentlemen at liberty, on the ground, not that the evidence is
insufficient to justify putting them on their trial, but that there is
actually no charge against them.8 How long will the French people bear
such a Ministry? The three injured representatives of the people will
not; for they have published in the newspapers a joint letter, pledging
themselves to seek justice from the Chambers against the authors of the
injury.9

It is said that poor M. Barthe, the ex-carbonaro, after being used for a
twelvemonth, and worn out, is to be turned off to make room for M.
Dupin.10

 EXAMINER, 21 OCT., 1832, PP. 680-1

A further walking tour in Cornwall left Mill refreshed for another
series on France. In his letter to Carlyle of 22 Oct., Mill says the
Examiner he is just sending will bring his article “on the Doctrinaires
& the new French Ministry, & from this time you may expect to see these
notices resumed. As for other newspaper-writing, it has been suspended
by the more serious work mentioned in my last letter to you [see the
headnote to No. 180], which Edition: current; Page: [512] being over,
other things will now have once more their turn.” (EL, CW, Vol. XII, p.
125.) The series includes Nos. 182, 183, 185, 187, 188, 190, and 192.
This article, headed “London, October 21, 1832,” is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “The summary of French news in the Examiner from 21st
Oct. 1832, to 24th Dec. of the same year, inclusive—comprising [ten
articles]” (MacMinn, p. 22). In the Somerville College set, this item is
listed as “Article on France” and enclosed in square brackets.

the present french ministry is a Tory Ministry.1 We say this advisedly.
It is true, that the Doctrinaires originally swore by our Whigs; but
this was while the Whigs differed only by a shade from the Tories. The
beau idéal of a Government, in the eyes of the Doctrinaires, is the
British Constitution as settled in 1688, and Mr. Pitt the paragon of a
patriot Minister. M. de Broglie passed a short time in England a few
months since, and, it is well known, was perfectly aghast at the Reform
Bill, bewailing our madness in casting away from us institutions so well
proved by time, and which had showered down upon us so many blessings.
The distinction between these men and the Carlists is but the difference
between a Pittite and a Jacobite.

This is deeply to be lamented; for it is undeniable that the Doctrinaire
leaders are among the most instructed and accomplished men in
France—incomparably superior, as thinkers and writers, to any English
Whigs, though they had the weakness to make these last their models. No
French Ministry, probably, ever contained so much literary talent, and
such extensive political and philosophical acquirements, as that which
numbers among its members MM. de Broglie, Guizot, and Thiers, yet none
ever was more certain of misgoverning France, and coming to a speedy and
disgraceful end. In fact, it is the real mental superiority of these
men, which, by becoming the foundation of a more than proportionate
superstructure of philosophic pedantry and self-conceit, has rendered
them far unfitter for actual dealing with the world than their English
prototypes. One scarcely knew whether to smile or to sigh, when a man of
M. Guizot’s real erudition and powers of thought, appeared sincerely to
look up to a mere superficial pretender to learning and philosophy like
Sir James Mackintosh; yet Sir James, like the rest of his party, could
bend to the exigencies of the age, while M. Guizot is resolved to be the
last person who gives up any of M. Guizot’s opinions.

The rise of Doctrinarism is naturally accounted for by the circumstances
of France during the fifteen years of the Restoration. The dynasty which
the Revolution had expelled, had just been replaced on the throne of
France by foreign bayonets. The people, however, remained attached to
the Revolution, and to the institutions and the habits which had grown
up under it. The two rival Edition: current; Page: [513] powers being
placed, as it were, en face, and the consequence of their continued
hostility being inevitably another convulsion, a class of philosophers
and politicians arose, who attempted to negotiate a compromise between
the old dynasty and the spirit of the revolution: who professed
attachment at once to liberty, and to legitimacy as the only sure
guarantee of stability,—who professed to set both the Royalists and the
Revolutionists right, as to the errors and excesses by which both
alternately had been ruined, and to have found the way by which France,
after so long vibrating between contrary extremes, might at last settle
down into the golden mean, and find freedom, tranquillity, and
happiness.

Unfortunately, these speculators, thinking it a fine thing to profit by
the lessons of history,—and being a kind of people for whom history has
no lessons, because they bring to its study no real knowledge of the
human mind, or of the character of their own age,—could hit upon nothing
better than erecting into universal maxims the conditions of the
compromise which they fancied had been made at our Revolution of 1688,
between the monarchical and the popular principle. This is an
instructive experiment upon what is to be expected from those who affect
to found their political wisdom principally on history, instead of
looking to history merely for suggestions, to be brought to the test of
a larger and surer experience. M. Guizot’s is no ordinary knowledge of
history: that subject has been the pursuit of his life; he has written
on it, and lectured on it, with great success; and has brought no
ordinary powers of philosophising to bear upon the analysis of its
evidences, and the explanation of its most remarkable events; as his
Essais sur l’Histoire de France (to say nothing of any of his other
works) amply evince.2 He has even produced an elaborate work on English
history;3 and yet when he comes to judge of the English constitution,
the historical knowledge which alone could be of use to him is precisely
that in which he is found deficient, namely, a knowledge how that
constitution actually works, in the country for which it was made—in the
very age in which he lives and moves, and in three hours’ sail may
personally commune with thousands of living witnesses, and have leave to
cross-examine them as he will.

Now, whoever knows the French and the English, knows, among other
things, this—that in England few, except the very greatest thinkers,
think systematically, or aim at connecting their scattered opinions into
a consistent scheme of general principles, from which they may reason
downwards to fresh particulars; but in France everybody who thinks, be
it never so contractedly, weaves a Edition: current; Page: [514] regular
web of opinions, suspends it cunningly on one or some greater number of
“principes,” and sits spider-like in the centre, surveying complacently
the whole of the web, or, as he fancies, of the world. In England,
accordingly, since Whig has ceased to be the correlative and opposite of
Jacobite, no person has been able to tell what Whiggery is, or what a
Whig believes. “Whig principles” simply meant, feeling and acting with
the men called Whigs; who were united, no doubt, by a common spirit, and
a general disposition to take similar views of most political questions
as they arose, but not by any definite creed or profession of faith. The
Whigs, therefore, gave up nothing, renounced no political doctrines,
when they proposed the recent great change in the constitution. They did
but, under the guidance of the same inclinations and general objects,
take what seemed to be the measures required by the actual circumstances
of the time. They were for the old system while they thought it worked
well, and for a new one when the old would hold together no longer. Not
so the Doctrinaires. They took the phrase “Whig principles” au pied de
la lettre. For them it was the symbol of a real creed, got at by
induction from the mere occasional dicta of their English instructors.
Whig principles, with the Whigs themselves, are in the state of
judiciary or common law: the Doctrinaires are the authors of the only
Whig code in existence. The theory of the British Constitution, with the
annotations of its Whig commentators, is in their eyes a system of
absolute truth, and its realization the acme of political improvement.
Whatever deviates from it, either to the right or to the left, is so far
false and wrong, and a proof that the nation which sanctions or requires
such deviation falls proportionally short of that highest point in
civilization, of which, when attained, that Constitution is the natural
and certain result. Of this political religion the main articles of
faith are, hereditary Monarchy—a hereditary House of Peers—a powerful
Aristocracy of wealth, to hold the balance between the King and the
people—the elective franchise limited by requiring a very high property
qualification, both from the elector and the elected—the Liberty of the
Press, that is, no censorship, but a libel law as indefinite as the
English, and to be executed, if necessary, as strictly and severely as
the French is at this moment—trial by jury, namely, a special jury, to
be composed as exclusively as possible of persons who think with the
Doctrinaires—and so forth.

Now these principles having been once dovetailed together into a system,
no departure from them, no modification of any sort, is to be conceded
to any pressure of circumstances. They are an unchangeable rule of
right, and are to be stickled for as if they concerned mankind’s eternal
salvation. The Doctrinaires have not the wisdom of the beaver; they will
never yield a part to save the remainder. They would not, like M.
Casimir Périer, have given up the hereditary Peerage; and they in fact
resisted its abolition to the last gasp, and would re-establish it
to-morrow, if the Chambers could be induced to pass a bill to that
effect. They are the most inflexible and impracticable of politicians.
The men of Edition: current; Page: [515] the world and of temporary
expediency, who are the other leaders of the juste milieu, consequently
look upon them as Bonaparte looked upon ideologists and metaphysicians.
M. Casimir Périer disliked nothing so much as to be identified with the
doctrinaires; and one of the chief causes of the failure of the attempt
to induce M. Dupin to take office, was (it is understood) his determined
refusal to form part of any administration of which they were members.

At least it cannot be said that this Ministry, like the last, is
composed of men mediocre in every respect, mere second-rate clerks in an
office. The Times, which has chopped round so briskly in its French
politics, but which has changed only its tack, not its mode of sailing,
has permitted itself a very pitiful sneer at the abilities and
reputation of M. Thiers.4 We dislike M. Theirs’ politics much, and his
unbounded suffisance still more; but nobody is entitled to speak
scornfully of the author of the best history in the French language, and
the best specimen of historical narrative, of any length, perhaps in all
modern literature.5 M. de Broglie’s speech on primogeniture, some years
ago, gave tokens of a far other man than he has proved himself,6 and his
writings on the administrative institutions of France have great merit.7
M. Guizot is one of the most instructed men, as well as one of the first
orators in France. With so much talent and knowledge, it would have been
impossible to form any other ministry so destitute of wisdom.

It is difficult to believe that they can stand. All parties dislike
them. They are understood to have been the advisers of the ordonnance
putting Paris under martial law.8 M. de Broglie has been the chief
instigator of the Chamber of Peers to all its collisions with the other
House. M. Guizot is probably at this moment the most unpopular man in
France. Whilst he is odious to the Liberals and to the Republicans, by
the contumelious language which he habitually uses towards them, he is
offensive to the deputies of the juste milieu party by his tranchant
dogmatical tone and professorial airs of superiority. Poor M. Thiers, on
his late visit to his birth-place, Provence, took care to avoid the
large towns for fear of a charivari, but reckoned without his host; for,
no sooner did he stop for the night, though it were but in a village,
than straightway the people assembled with cat-calls, frying-pans, and
saucepan-lids, and gave him the unwelcome serenade which he had gone out
of his way to avoid. As for the place-hunter Soult, the humble servant
of all governments, minister under Louis XVIII, made a Peer by Charles
X, as corrupt and rapacious as the rest of Napoleon’s military banditti,
and said to have already filled his pockets largely by fraudulent
contracts since he Edition: current; Page: [516] has been Minister of
War; he is placed at the head of the ministry only that the King may be
the real minister, it being believed that a Doctrinaire, if he were
called Prime Minister, would expect to be so, and not simply a
cat’s-paw.

The first act of the Ministry has been to create a batch of fifty-nine
Peers.9 The list of names, to any one versed in the personnel of French
politics, is amusing enough. Nearly twenty are ejected Deputies of the
juste-milieu or the moderate Royalist party of the Martignac Chamber;
men, who, even under the present law of election, which returns a
decided majority of the stationary party, have not been able to get
themselves re-elected any where, though some of them have tried in three
or four places. The remainder are generals, préfets, ambassadors, and
other public functionaries, of no political character at all, and full
half of them either of notorious and laughable imbecility, or bad
private character. The only men of real merit in the batch are two or
three such as MM. Allent and De Fréville, hard-working and able men of
business, of flexible and easy political convictions; together with the
well-known M. de Montlosier; M. Thenard, eminent as a chemist and
experimental philosopher, but the feeblest of politicians; and MM.
Cousin and Villemain, the celebrated lecturers at the Sorbonne,
doctrinaires of the first water.10 This last was once a Deputy for about
three months, vacated his seat by accepting a place, and has ever since
been vainly knocking at the door of one electoral college after another,
without being able to obtain admission. Three hundred of the party could
get into the Chamber, yet a man of M. Villemain’s merit as a writer and
orator could not, simply because he was a doctrinaire.

One fact deserves notice. Forty or fifty of the supporters of the
Government party in the present Chamber of Deputies, thought themselves
entitled to Peerages, yet two only have obtained their wish—Marshal
Gérard, and M. Bertin de Vaux,11 chief proprietor and editor of the
Journal des Débats. Why is this? It must be because the Ministry dreads
the consequences of any considerable number of new elections in the
present state of the public mind.

Examiner.

in reading the trial of M. Berryer, we almost doubt whether the scenes
that are unfolded took place in a civilized country.1 The papers of the
accused falsified in order to manufacture evidence against him; the
chief witness for the prosecution, indeed the only one who testified to
anything, a man calling himself a Lieutenant-Colonel, so manifestly
perjured that the avocat général was obliged to throw up the
accusation;2 the procureur du roi at Nantes convicted by his own
admission of having sent up to his official superiors a pretended
confession of M. Berryer, on which three other persons were seized and
thrown into prison,3 when in truth he had never seen M. Berryer, nor had
M. Berryer made any disclosure to any one; this same procureur du roi
now saying, by way of excuse, that if it was not M. Berryer who made the
disclosures to him, it was another person;4 the avowed author of this
manifest forgery not instantly dismissed from his situation, but called
to Paris, as the Moniteur phrases it,5 to explain his conduct; then the
reflection that on such evidence a Deputy was to have been tried by a
Court-Martial, if the decree of the Court of Cassation had not averted
the dire infliction6—altogether the picture of the French government and
of the administration of justice and the state of public morality in
France, is such as it is frightful to witness.

Another incident not unworthy of notice has recently happened. M. Audry
de Puyraveau is one of the most steady and incorruptible members of the
côté Edition: current; Page: [518] gauche, and one of the most esteemed
private characters in France.7 He was one of the very small number of
Deputies who gave active aid in the resistance to the Ordinances of
Charles X; and, like so many other persons, he has been rewarded by the
ruin of his private fortunes; for the greater part of his property was
embarked in a roulage speculation; his fixed capital of carts and
waggons was mostly taken to make barricades of, and rendered useless; he
participated, too, in the losses occasioned by the subsequent commercial
distress. His remaining property, consisting of three landed estates,
being mortgaged for more than it would now sell for, M. Audry determined
to dispose of it by lottery, as the only means of making the proceeds
suffice to clear off the entire debt. Now there is a law, passed in the
time of the French Republic, by which private lotteries are illegal.8
That law has never been deemed applicable to lotteries of this
description. M. de Chateaubriand a few years ago was permitted to take
this particular mode of selling an estate; and a lottery took place not
many months since, for the benefit of the Poles. No matter: an
Opposition Deputy had brought himself within the letter of the law; the
Government pounced upon him, and not content with annulling the
transaction, obtained from the Court of First Instance a judgment
condemning M. Audry to fine, imprisonment, and the confiscation of the
three landed estates! M. Audry appealed to a higher court, which set
aside the confiscation as contrary to the charter, but confirmed the
remainder of the judgment, and imposed a much larger fine upon M. Audry.
There is another court of appeal still in reserve, and to this M. Audry
has had recourse. We have here a specimen of the Citizen King: for the
King it is, and not the Minister, who is the author of this, as well as
of the persecution of the Press, and all the other odious proceedings of
the Government. His Ministers are only the base instruments of his
individual will.

The late préfet of Grenoble, M. Maurice Duval, who charged the unarmed
people from both ends of a street at once, so that they had no escape,
and were forced to remain and be butchered—a man whose conduct even
Casimir Périer condemned in private, though he had the dishonesty to
defend it in public—this man has been made a peer of France, and
promoted to be préfet of Nantes.9 That hitherto peaceful city, in which
the best understanding existed between the Edition: current; Page: [519]
people and the former préfet,10 would not brook this insolent
appointment. On the day of M. Duval’s arrival, he underwent a charivari
of four hours; this was repeated the next day on a still grander scale,
until the troops were called out, and the people dispersed.11

M. Guizot once said in a speech in the Chamber, that, in a
well-constituted government, a good minister must expect to be
unpopular.12 The ministry of which he himself forms a part, bears a very
close resemblance to a good ministry in this particular. It is likely to
prove too good, to be popular even with the Chamber of Deputies; and the
newspapers already talk of a new modification, turning out M. Guizot, at
least.13

the french government has performed an act worthy of commendation, if it
be followed up in the spirit in which it is conceived, and which has
escaped the notice of the English Newspapers,—the re-establishment of
the Department of Moral and Political Science in the Institute.1

In the original scheme of the Institute, as suggested by Talleyrand in
his report to the Constituent Assembly on National Education,2 as
re-touched by Condorcet in another report submitted to the Assemblée
Législative,3 and as ultimately Edition: current; Page: [520] adopted by
the Convention on the proposition of one of the still surviving
ornaments of that great period of history, M. Daunou,4 (and long may he
yet survive!) the moral and political sciences occupied the prominent
place which justly belongs to them in any attempt to bring together into
one body the men who have done the greatest things for science and
philosophy. But a despot came, in whose sight all which savoured of
thought and inquiry in politics or morals was odious; and, with a stroke
of the pen, the Department of Moral and Political Science was blotted
out from the Institute.5 The Bourbons were as little disposed as
Bonaparte to look with favour upon such pursuits. Casimir Périer, we
suspect, would have fully sympathised with the “hero” and the
“descendant of St. Louis”6 in an aversion so natural, and, for a selfish
government, so reasonable. But the Doctrinaires, setting up for
philosophers themselves, and owing all their reputation to the
cultivation of philosophy, have no prejudice against it.

The new Academy of Moral and Political Science will, we suppose, publish
Transactions, at the public expense; and the members will be allowed
pensions sufficient to enable them to confine themselves to philosophic
pursuits. This is so far good; provided the appointments are not given
to favour, but bestowed exclusively on persons who, by what they have
already done, have proved that it is for the interest of society to
place them in such a situation that philosophy may have an exclusive
claim upon their time and exertions. Further than this, we know not that
such bodies are ever likely to be of much use; but if an institution
exists which professes to embody the most distinguished men in all
branches of science, it is a disgrace to the nation that the most
important sciences of all should be excluded; and by removing this ban
from moral and political philosophy, and publicly proclaiming that in
the estimation of France they are sciences, and sciences of transcendant
value, an impulse will be given to a really scientific study of them,
for which the Guizot ministry are entitled to all praise.

The Academy is to consist of thirty members, and to be divided into five
sections; namely, moral philosophy; legislation; droit public et
jurisprudence; political economy and statistics; general history and the
history of philosophy.

All who were members of this branch of the Institute when it was
dissolved by Napoleon, and who still survive, are retained as the
nucleus of the new Academy. It is interesting to review the list of
these distinguished relics of the last age. Sieyès, Talleyrand, Daunou,
Garat, Merlin (de Douai), Roederer, Edition: current; Page: [521]
Pastoret, Lacuée de Cessac, Reinhardt, Dacier.7 To these are added those
of the surviving corresponding members, who have since become members of
the other branches of the Institute; namely, MM. Destutt-Tracy and de
Gérando.8 These were to elect, by ballot, four more, which completes the
number sixteen, (necessary by the former statutes) to supply the
remaining vacancies. These sixteen are then to elect seven others, and
those twenty-three are to elect the remaining seven. The first four were
to be selected (for no good reason that we can see) from the ranks of
the Institute itself. The successful candidates were, MM. Cousin, Dupin
(the advocate), Alexandre Delaborde, and Naudet.9 The remaining fourteen
are not yet elected. It is from their names that we shall judge whether
the new institution is intended as an encouragement to philosophy, or as
a mere trick for popularity.

Several of the Doctrinaires themselves ought unquestionably to be
members of Edition: current; Page: [522] the body; especially M. Guizot
himself, (who ought not, however, to draw the salary,) and MM.
Royer-Collard and Jouffroy.10 These, we have no doubt, will be elected.
But the list ought to contain various names, some of which are less
acceptable to the party now in power. It ought to comprehend Say, the
eminent political economist; Comte, and Dunoyer,11 the authors of the
Censeur Européen, and various important works; Cormenin, the ablest
political writer in France, whose works on Administration have earned
him so well-merited a reputation;12 and others whom it would be tedious
to enumerate. We shall see whether the suffrages of the Academy fall on
such men, or what others are preferred to them.


184.: THE CORN LAWS
 EXAMINER, 18 NOV., 1832, P. 739

This comment is appended, in square brackets, to a long letter to the
editor in the “Political Examiner” signed “W.P.G.,” and headed: “A Plan
for Admitting Foreign Corn, Yet limiting the Extent of Importation, so
far as is necessary for preserving some given Minimum of Price to the
British Farmer.” The correspondent argues that the attempt to regulate
grain imports according to previous prices is inefficient because
fictitious sales cannot be prevented, and immense quantities of grain
can be warehoused when the duty is low. He proposes an alternative,
regulating the duty according to the quantity imported and sold. The
item is described in Mill’s bibliography as “Two paragraphs of
observations on a letter respecting the Corn Laws; in the Exam. of 18th
Nov. 1832” (MacMinn, p. 23). In the Somerville College set of the
Examiner, it is listed as “Paragraphs on the Corn Laws” and enclosed in
a second set of square brackets.

we have great pleasure in giving publicity to this plan, which is
founded on a just train of thought, though we think it unsuited to the
character which the Corn Question has now assumed. The idea of
facilitating the transition to free trade by limiting (for a time) the
quantity imported, instead of imposing a gradually decreasing duty, was
suggested a few years ago by some able and enlightened Edition: current;
Page: [523] writers in the Parliamentary Review, a work which had not
the success it deserved.1

But we should object to the plan of our correspondent, as applicable to
the Corn Laws, on two grounds. First, because a small difference in the
quantity of food makes a great difference in its price, so that no one
could judge what number of quarters must be admitted to bring the price
to 54s. And secondly, on a more enlarged ground, agreeing with W.P.G.
that 54s. is a price that any reasonable farmer would now be contented
with, we are convinced that the importation of Corn, duty free, would
not sink the price below that point. Our reason is this:—Under the
present Corn Law2 the wheat which has been imported has paid, on an
average, no more than from 6s. to 7s. of duty. The present Corn Law,
therefore, cannot be much more than equivalent to a fixed duty of that
amount; consequently, if the average price in our Corn Market be, as our
correspondent affirms, 63s., you might take off the duty entirely, and
wheat could not be sold for much less than 56s.


185.: FRENCH NEWS [72]
 EXAMINER, 25 NOV., 1832, P. 760

Mill here resumes his detailed account of the French legislative
chambers, at the beginning of their new session on 19 Nov. The article
is memorable for its tribute to Jean Baptiste Say, in whose house Mill
had stayed during his boyhood visit to France. For the entry in Mill’s
bibliography, see No. 181. The item, headed “London, November 25, 1832,”
is listed as “Article on France” and enclosed in square brackets in the
Somerville College set of the Examiner.

the french chambers have met. As the King was on his way to open the
session, a pistol was fired at him. This will probably be found to be
one of the low tricks with which the French police has long familiarised
us. A real attempt to assassinate Louis-Philippe would probably prolong
his lease of bad government for several years. Such acts have always, in
modern times, proved Edition: current; Page: [524] fatal to the party in
whose name they were perpetrated. We firmly believe that but for the
murder of Marat by the unfortunate enthusiast Charlotte Corday, the
heads of the Girondists would not have fallen under the guillotine;1 and
every one knows that the assassination of the Duc de Berri was the
signal of the reaction which brought the royalists into power, and kept
them there for ten years.

The King’s speech evinces an obstinacy not unworthy of his Dutch
counterpart.2 He means to brazen out the violation of the Charter and
virtual suspension of all law through the arbitrary measures of June
last,3 and to defy the constantly increasing strength of the hostile
public opinion.

It was expected that the contest for the Presidentship of the Chamber
would have been decisive of the strength of parties; but the ministry
have eluded this trial by instructing their adherents to vote for M.
Dupin, who, with a body of supporters, has gone into a qualified
opposition. If, by the aid of this junction, M. Dupin obtain the
majority over the other candidate, M. Laffitte, the result, we suppose,
will be crowed over as a ministerial triumph.

A far greater event than these wretched ephemeral victories or defeats,
is the death of an eminent man. France has this week lost another of her
most distinguished writers and citizens, the celebrated political
economist, M. Say. The invaluable branch of knowledge to which the
greatest of his intellectual exertions were devoted, is indebted to him,
amongst others, for those great and all-pervading truths which have
elevated it to the rank of a science; and to him, far more than to any
others, for its popularization and diffusion. Nor was M. Say a mere
political economist; else had he been necessarily a bad one. He knew
that a subject so “immersed in matter” (to use the fine expression of
Lord Bacon)4 as a nation’s prosperity, must be looked at on many sides,
in order to be seen rightly even on one. M. Say was one of the most
accomplished minds of his age and country. Though he had given his chief
attention to one particular aspect of human affairs, all their aspects
were interesting to him; not one was excluded from his survey. His
private life was a model of the domestic virtues. From the Edition:
current; Page: [525] time when with Chamfort and Ginguené he founded the
Décade Philosophique, the first work which attempted to revive literary
and scientific pursuits during the storms of the French
Revolution5—alike when courted by Napoleon and when persecuted by him,
(he was expelled from the Tribunat for presuming to have an independent
opinion); unchanged equally during the sixteen years of the Bourbons and
the two of Louis Philippe—he passed unsullied through all the trials and
temptations which have left a stain on every man of feeble virtue among
his conspicuous contemporaries. He kept aloof from public life, but was
the friend and trusted adviser of some of its brightest ornaments; and
few have contributed more, though in a private station, to keep alive in
the hearts and in the contemplation of men a lofty standard of public
virtue.

If this feeble testimony, from one not wholly unknown to him, should
meet the eye of any who loved him, may it, in so far as such things can,
afford that comfort under the loss, which can be derived from the
knowledge that others know and feel all its irreparableness!


186.: FRENCH AND ENGLISH JOURNALS
 EXAMINER, 2 DEC., 1832, PP. 772-3

Mill mentions in passing this article as well as Nos. 191 and 195
(already written) to Carlyle in a letter of 27 Dec., 1832 (EL, CW, Vol.
XII, p. 133), in which he again summarizes his strenuous activities,
including the composition of “The Currency Juggle” and “What Is Poetry?”
The long quotation from Le National and Mill’s comment on it signal his
continuing, indeed growing, interest in its editor, Armand Carrel, who
probably wrote the article Mill quotes (“Des correspondances des
journaux anglais,” 31 Oct., 1832, pp. 2-3). The article, headed as
title, is in the “Political Examiner.” It is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “An article headed ‘French and English Journals’ in the
Ex. of 2d December” (MacMinn, p. 23). In the Somerville College set of
the Examiner, it is listed as “French and English Journals” and enclosed
in square brackets.

we quote the following article from the National:

The English Newspapers have a very convenient method of treating the
affairs of France. Their editors seem never to take the trouble of
studying, or even of reading, the organs of public opinion in this
country. The only Parisian Journals which reach London are those which
have been long established. The wiseacres of London affect to despise
our Edition: current; Page: [526] Newspapers, and seem to imagine that
the French are too light-headed, too destitute of reason, to be judges
of their own affairs. Even as narrators of facts we are completely
disdained by our insular brethren. Their custom is to have a
correspondent here, to whose statements and to whose single opinion they
give implicit confidence. So long as these correspondents have merely
put forth contradictions and absurdities, we have paid no attention to
them; but as they have evinced a peculiar animosity against the
National, we must at least request that the editor who treats us with so
much incivility will take the trouble to inform himself who and what we
are.

For a long time past, the Paris correspondent of the London Globe has
made us the subject of violent attacks: a week never goes by without his
throwing out against us an epigram obligato: and frequently the London
editor, without even deigning to cast his eyes upon his antagonist,
re-echoes the witticism as from himself.1 We were at first surprised, we
admit, at this want of fair-dealing and politeness in a Journal which is
not destitute either of liberality or of enlightened views. But the
Globe is essentially doctrinaire: it has all the qualities of that
coterie, even down to their pedantry; and as we are naturally honoured
with the hatred of that amphibious breed of political writers, it was
quite simple that their English brethren, the half-Tories, half-Whigs,
should follow the example. We, therefore, do not complain of their
animosity, but of their dishonesty; of which the following is an
instance:—

Last week there appeared in our columns an article on the state of
Ireland, and the progress which the question of the Repeal of the Union
is making in that country.2 In confirmation of our assertion, we said,
that the accession of Mr. Sheil to the Repeal Party was one of the
surest signs of that progress, and of the ultimate success of the
proposition.3 We reasoned thus, not because Mr. Sheil possesses
sufficient personal influence to determine the adoption of the measure,
but because he is essentially a man of moderation and prudence, an enemy
of extreme courses, and embracing them only when it is impossible or
impolitic to delay longer, that is, when extreme courses begin to
prevail. We announced Mr. Sheil’s conversion not as a cause, but as a
presage of the great measure of a legislative separation of England and
Ireland. This conclusion may not be relished by the Globe, the organ of
Mr. Stanley;4 but the editor would not have contemned our argument if he
had taken the trouble to know what it was.

The Galignani’s Messenger had cut down the article of the National into
these few words, that the repeal must be carried, because Mr. Sheil has
become a convert to it.5 Hereupon the Globe, who, it seems, reads
Galignani but not the National, quotes the version which the former gave
of the opinion of the latter, and adds to the quotation a disdainful
remark.6

Edition: current; Page: [527]
This is but one example among a thousand of the dishonesty and levity
with which all French affairs are treated in the juste-milieu Papers of
London, while their brethren here are preaching about the possibility of
an alliance with England. Within this day or two another Paper, the
Courier, observed, that it was much to be regretted that French troops
should have gone into Don Pedro’s service, because their presence in the
constitutional army served only to exasperate the Miguelites. Such is
the funeral oration which that Paper pronounces on the brave French
battalion which has been almost exterminated in defending Oporto!7

From our complaints against the soi-disant liberal English Journals, we
must however except the Times, whose columns are open to correspondents
of all opinions on French affairs. One of the correspondents, evidently
and avowedly a Frenchman, is lavish of eulogium on the doctrinaires;8
but the language of good society is not unknown to him. The Times too,
and the Times alone, seems to be conversant with the French Papers; and
though its spirit of exclusive and selfish nationality makes it
substantially our antagonist, it often redeems this fault by touches of
generosity for which we are bound to give it credit.

We subscribe to the justice of the above strictures on the English
Journalists, who, however, must not be confounded with the English
people. One reason why our Newspaper Editors do not judge of France by
the French Newspapers is, that they cannot help feeling how erroneously
England would be judged if it were judged by them. The truth is (and our
friends of the National must not allow themselves to forget it), that
while the French Journals represent the most generous and high-minded
portion of the French public, our Newspapers represent, almost
exclusively, the baser and more sordid part of ours. The French Papers
are written by the most enthusiastic, or the most ambitious,—either way
the most aspiring,—among the youth of the educated and refined classes.
Ours are conducted by hirelings, and as a trade. The French Journalists,
in powers of thought and scientific acquirements, are the élite of their
country; the English, as a class, are little if at all above the average
of theirs. Nor does there exist in France any class corresponding to one
sort of the persons connected with the English newspapers,—adventurers,
uneducated and low-bred, whose connexion with the Press gives them a
power which they never could have gained by any other means, which they
are wholly unfit to be trusted with, and with which they Edition:
current; Page: [528] play such “fantastic tricks before high heaven”9 as
are naturally to be looked for in men intoxicated with unmerited and
unexpected importance.

There are exceptions to the general low state of the English press. The
Editor of the Globe, for instance, who has used our brother of the
National so ill, is a gentleman and a scholar; and not without a
conscience either, though he squares it a little too much by
respectability.10 But he labours under a grievous misfortune,—a
misfortune to his country, whom it deprives of the enthusiastic services
of such a man; but a misfortune beyond all measure or limit to the man
himself, the very heart of whose moral being it eats out,—the affliction
of despising every one who is in earnest. His literary career has been
that of a man who not only has no faith, no convictions of his own, but
in whose estimation, to have any strong convictions, and to care any
thing about them, is a proof of weakness, rawness, and ignorance of the
world. He should prefix a motto to his Paper, and that motto should be
“Rub on.” We will paraphrase it thus: “Mankind are foolish enough to
care about certain things, and to believe that their lot might be better
than it is. No wise man will share any such delusion; but, also, no wise
man will fly in the face of mankind, and tell them that they are
following an ignis fatuus, because they would be angry, and their anger
would disturb his tranquillity, and a wise man values his tranquillity
above all things. Therefore, a wise man does not like change; but when
it would be more troublesome to resist than to yield, a wise man will
let the fools have their way.”

Of course, such a man must despise the writers of the National, together
with all persons else who are for any kind of “movement,” and, in
general, all who have any aspirations beyond quietness and
respectability. The National will remember Signor Pococurante in
Candide, and how all great men, even of past ages, appeared little in
his eyes.11 Voltaire has nowhere shewn a deeper insight into human
nature.

The Editor of the National, (let us drop the idle circumlocution, and
call him by his name,) M. Carrel, then, should know that he does too
much honour to such a Paper as the Courier, when he condescends to
censure it.12 Nothing goes farther to convince us how ignorant the
French Journalists are of the state of public opinion in England, than
their continuing to quote from the Courier in 1832, because it was the
Treasury Journal in 1817. We beg to assure them that Edition: current;
Page: [529] nobody in this country ever seeks or cares to know what the
Courier thinks or says on any one thing, or on any person. Englishmen,
to their shame be it said, can bear a large measure of political
profligacy, when combined with talent; but a Paper which changes its
Editor and its principles every three months, without any change in the
proprietorship,13 and never once in ten years says one word deserving to
be remembered, is too much for our stomachs.

It is difficult to explain, in the limits of an article, all the causes
which render the English Newspapers an imperfect exponent of the
feelings of the English people towards the French. We may just allude to
a few of them. The enormous stamp duty on Newspapers, which is six or
seven times higher than in France, is one cause why our Daily Press is
limited in its circulation almost exclusively to the monied classes, and
if it represents any opinion at all, represents that of those classes.
Now M. Carrel will allow that the corresponding classes in France, the
subscribers to the Débats and the Constitutionnel,14 are a miserably bad
sample of the French nation; and we implore him to believe that ours
represent the English nation quite as ill. Another circumstance, the
force of which we cannot expect him to feel in the same degree, is the
engrossing character of the avocation of a London daily journalist. As a
piece of complex and elaborate machinery, a French Daily Newspaper to an
English is a wheelbarrow to the steam-carriages on the Manchester
railway. The man whose hand gives the impulse and whose head the
guidance to that great engine, cannot stir from his post: he can neither
read, think, nor converse with the world: he can but write. He neither
strengthens his powers nor adds to his knowledge: such as he at first
was, he remains,—spinning a lengthening thread of thin talk out of his
original raw material of thought, or improvising a judgment on passing
events with such share of untutored sagacity as God gave him, and no
more. Now, most of our Newspaper writers began to write in the piping
times of Toryism and national antipathy; and the wonder is, not that so
little but that so much of the new ideas and new feelings of the English
public should have reached them. M. Carrel compliments the Times on its
occasional relaxations of its anti-French spirit: we can assure him that
the “touches of generosity” which he speaks of, find a responding chord
in every English bosom which Toryism has not petrified; while the spirit
to which those touches are exceptions is very generally regarded as an
Edition: current; Page: [530] instance of the antiquated John-Bullism,
which, in many other things besides this, distinguishes that Journal. We
can assure him, moreover, that the close union between France and
England, which he seems to think chimerical, is earnestly desired by all
parties in this country except the Tories; for our juste-milieu feels
its cause bound up with the French juste-milieu, and our mouvement with
the French mouvement. The popular party in England think as ill of the
present French Government as M. Carrel himself, and are as anxious as he
can be that republican institutions, whether with an elective or
hereditary chief, should be firmly established in France. It is true we
are imperfectly acquainted with France, and are therefore, perhaps, the
more fearful; and we often tremble lest some imprudence or precipitation
on the part of our friends and brothers the French patriots, should
compromise their avenir and our own. But though we may occasionally
advise and deprecate, and even remonstrate, their cause is still our
cause: it is the cause of improvement against stagnation, of public
spirit and virtue against corruption and intrigue; it is the cause to
which, and to all who in singleness of purpose have espoused it, our
souls are wedded without possibility of divorce; and by that and them,
in good or evil fortune, in good report or bad, and whether our advice
is followed or not, we have made our election to stand.

m. dupin has the ball at his feet. He has been elected President of the
Chamber of Deputies by an overwhelming majority.1 MM. Bérenger and
Etienne, the leaders of the intermediate party which has rallied round
him, stand highest on the list of the Vice-Presidents.2 The Opposition
is completely defeated. Of the nine office-bearers of the Chamber, (the
President, four Vice-Presidents, and four Secretaries,) only one
Secretary, M. Félix Réal, has been chosen from the ranks of the
mouvement, and he stands lowest on the list.3 The strength of the
Edition: current; Page: [531] Opposition in the Chamber amounts to about
150 members, being ten more than the number who signed the compte rendu.

This result coincides with our previous anticipations.4 The Chamber, as
at present constituted, is for the status quo; it approves all that has
been done hitherto, but is for doing nothing more. It is thus
distinguished equally from the mouvement party, who advocate the further
extension of popular rights, and from the doctrinaires, who advised the
recent violation of the Constitution, who supported the hereditary
peerage, and would restore it to-morrow if they could, who regret the
downfal of the exiled dynasty, and accept the Revolution of 1830 only as
an unavoidable misfortune. The bourgeois oligarchy, who have enthroned
themselves in the yet warm seats of the feudal aristocracy, have that
very common taste which makes men desire to level down to themselves,
but not an inch lower.

In the Commission for preparing the address, not one single Deputy of
the Opposition found a place, but MM. Etienne and Bérenger did.5 We
expect to meet these gentlemen everywhere for some time to come. The
former of them, who is the principal proprietor of the Constitutionnel,
is already spoken of as the probable successor to M. Guizot, if the
illness under which the latter is now suffering should cause a vacancy
in his office.

We are somewhat impatient to know the part which the leaders of the
intermediate party will take in the debate on the address. As for M.
Dupin himself, his office of President will save him from the
disagreeable necessity of committing himself to any opinion.

The King’s speech promised to bring forward the bills so long expected,
for the education of the people, the responsibility of Ministers,
municipal institutions, &c.; and also threatened the country with laws
for strengthening the hands of justice, or some such phrase;—laws, we
suppose, for gagging the press.6 Our chief anxiety is to see whether the
Intermediates offer any vigorous opposition to these iniquitous
projects.

If M. Dupin becomes Prime Minister by a total change of Ministry, he
will, we suppose, bring in with him MM. Bérenger as Minister of Justice;
Bignon, Edition: current; Page: [532] Foreign Affairs; Etienne, Public
Instruction; probably M. Teste7 in some capacity or other; and so on.
But if he comes in by an understanding with the present Cabinet, it is
impossible to foresee how he will be forced to compose his own.

The pistol-plot would appear to be a trick of the young woman
(Mademoiselle Boury) who pretended to have frustrated it.8 There is
strong reason to believe that the pistol was loaded only with powder,
and was fired by herself, on speculation, to obtain money from the Royal
Family, and a place for a young man to whom she is attached.

the address of the French Chamber of Deputies was an exact echo of the

carried almost unanimously.1 All the amendments of the Opposition, or
compte rendu party, in condemnation of the état de siége, or of any part
of the policy of the present French Government, were defeated by large
majorities. The Intermediates, or M. Dupin’s party, have for the present
thrown their entire weight into the Ministerial scale. The address was
drawn up by one of their leaders, M. Etienne.

The pistol-plot becomes every day more evidently apocryphal; but it has
served the turn of the Ministry, by furnishing an excuse to those who
only needed one, for rallying round the Government.2

life, to great influence in the councils of his country; and few among
the rising men in office, or those likely to be in office, were
comparable to him in that public spirit, and enlarged liberality of
sentiment and principle, which would have made his influence a source of
benefits to his country and the world, whereof it is lamentable to think
that they should thus unexpectedly be deprived. To his personal friends
the loss is most severe, and will be felt even by those who only knew
him in the way of official intercourse. Few men ever conciliated in a

191.: ON THE NECESSITY OF UNITING THE QUESTION OF CORN LAWS WITH THAT OF TITHES
 EXAMINER, 23 DEC., 1832, PP. 817-18

Mentioned in Mill’s letter to Carlyle of 27 Dec. (see No. 186), this
article, headed as title, is the first leader in the “Political
Examiner.” It is described in Mill’s bibliography as “An article headed
‘On the Necessity of Uniting the question of Corn Laws with that of
Tithes.’ Exam. 23d Dec. 1832.” (MacMinn, p. 23.) In the Somerville
College copy of the Examiner, it is listed as title and enclosed
(including the final footnote) in square brackets.

on looking round and surveying the attitude and movements of the
constituencies, both new and reformed, which have been created by the
late Act, we see reason to congratulate the friends of improvement upon
the definiteness of their objects, and the zeal and unanimity of their
exertions. Scarcely a voice has been raised for any causeless or
fantastic change, nor has any captiousness been exhibited about mere
forms and phrases. This, indeed, would have been inconsistent with the
positive, practical, matter-of-fact character of the English mind.
Almost as seldom has the advocacy of any act of individual wrong—of the
plunder of any man’s property, or the blighting of his reasonable
prospects,—met with encouraging reception from any body of electors.
There is enough of integrity and self-control, and respect for the just
rights of others, in the English character, to forbid this. The
reforming spirit has fastened upon the real grievances, and with the
greatest intenseness upon the most crying and barefaced of these.
General rectitude of purpose has produced unity of purpose. The
Reformers in all parts of the island proclaim the same objects, proclaim
them as with one voice—a voice destined ere long to silence all other
sounds except its own echo.

To this unanimity one question forms a solitary exception. That indeed
is an alarming one, and may even yet become a firebrand of discord in
the ranks of the sincere Reformers, unless disposed of soon and
well,—not with the kind of prudence which is synonymous with indecision
and cowardice, but with that true and statesman-like kind which can
foresee as well as see, and of which the foremost ingredient is courage.
This question, the only one within the compass Edition: current; Page:
[535] of probability from which a Tory reaction, among any considerable
part of our population, can ever again be apprehended, is the Corn Laws.

On this question alone, among the many which are now vehemently
agitated, is Reformer at variance with Reformer. On all other subjects
the contest will be solely between the Stationary principle and the
Progressive: between the spirit of Toryism, whether under its own or
under Whig colours, and the spirit of Reform. On this alone a division
is manifesting itself between the two great sections of the people; and
there is imminent (though not immediate) danger, that the
representatives of the manufacturing and commercial towns, and the
representatives of the counties, the agricultural towns, and Ireland,
will, by the artifices of the common enemy, be set one against the
other;—the agriculturists under a total misapprehension of the nature of
their interest in the question, the manufacturers greatly
over-estimating the degree of theirs.

We may be sure that nothing would serve the purposes of the Tories so
well, as to be able to pick a quarrel between the two great divisions of
the reforming host, on this the only subject of dissension ever likely
to afford them such an opportunity.

So deeply are we impressed with the importance of frustrating these
tactics of our enemies, that if a question which affects, be it ever in
so slight a degree, the condition of the most numerous class, were not
in our eyes important beyond any other, we would gladly put off the
discussion of this question, until others, on which there is less
difference of sentiment and of apparent interest, shall have been set at
rest. We do not, indeed, think that the immediate interests of the
working classes are so deeply concerned in this as in several other
questions. The effects of the present Corn Laws1 in any way, be it for
good or for evil, are in our estimation far short of what either party
habitually assumes. But when we consider the transcendant importance of
the principle which is at issue, where the dispute is (what it here is)
between the drones of society and the bees; when we see that both the
drones and the bees think, however erroneously, that it is a question of
life and death between them—when, too, we perceive how generally the
members, both for the counties and for the towns, are coming to the new
Parliament, if not positively pledged, at least with a distinct
expectation on the part of their constituents, that they will give their
strongest support or opposition to any abatement of the existing
“protection to agriculture;” we cannot doubt that this discussion must
be among the earliest which will come on, and that it is not too soon to
begin to consider by what means it may be prevented from becoming a
source of disunion among the Reformers, and of strength to the
Conservatives, by rallying round the standard of Anti-reform in general,
the enemies of one particular Reform.

An opportunity now offers itself, such as does not occur once in a
century, and Edition: current; Page: [536] which might seem as if sent
on purpose to carry England safely through this difficult passage.

The cry is now irresistible for the extinction of Tithes. There is not a
rational person throughout the country, whatever be his wishes, who
thinks it possible that this odious impost can exist one year longer.
Now, the way to make peace for ever between the agriculturists and the
manufacturers would be this: Unite the question of the Corn Laws with
the question of Tithes. Throw yourselves upon the country with the boon
of relief, at one stroke, from the two most flagrant of its grievances,
the two most keenly felt of its burthens. Come with the Tithe in one
hand—the freedom of the Corn trade in the other: hold out the one to the
farmer, the other to the manufacturer. A minister who should thus act,
would save the country from its worst chance of prolonged intestine
divisions, himself from a perilous shoal on which even a strong
administration can with difficulty avoid being wrecked, and would obtain
a new lease of public confidence, which would enable him, with ordinary
good sense and good intention, to retain as long as he pleased the
control of the Movement in his own hands.

These two questions, of which policy so strongly dictates the union, are
besides in their own nature so intimately allied, that no philosophical
statesman would ever think of looking at either of the two, except with
immediate reference to the other.

The people of England are supplied with food by two channels—home
production, and importation. Both are taxed: what is Tithe, but a tax on
the home growth? What are the Corn Laws, but a tax on the importation?
Now, it is not only admitted by every one whose opinion is worth
counting, but is obvious to the merest tyro in the principles of
commerce, that these two modes of procuring corn, if taxed at all, ought
to be taxed exactly alike. To lay any burthen exclusively on either of
the two, is to tax the community for the sake of a factitious
encouragement to the other. If, for instance, there were a Tithe, and no
Corn Laws, the effect would be to force an importation, when additional
food might be grown with less labour from our own soil. If, again, there
were Corn Laws, and no Tithe there would be virtually a bounty on home
production; forcing cultivation on bad soils, to raise a portion of food
which the nation could obtain with a less expenditure of labour and
capital by importing.

Accordingly, the only argument among those urged in favour of Corn Laws,
to which a thinking man would pay the slightest regard, is the existence
of Tithe, or of other burthens on the cultivation of the soil,
generally, but erroneously, supposed to be analogous to Tithe. Take away
the Tithe, and there is not a word to be said for the Corn Laws; but
take away the Tithe, leaving the Corn Laws, and you add just so much to
their pressure. Every weight taken off the shoulders of one of two
competitors is tantamount to laying an exactly equal burthen upon the
other.

Only consider how all the practical difficulties of both questions will
be Edition: current; Page: [537] alleviated by disposing of them in
conjunction. What, in truth, is the leading objection felt by every one
to the total extinction of Tithes? The fear lest what is taken from the
clergyman should be merely given to the landlord. To obviate this (a
consequence which all agree in deprecating), fifty cumbrous, and
trouble-some, and uncertain contrivances have been thought of and
propounded, for not abolishing but commuting the Tithe into a land-tax,
or rent-charge, to be collected on account of the Church or on account
of the State. All this operose machinery is but needless perplexity. For
giving the benefit of the remission of Tithe to the consumer, instead of
the landlord, there is a far simpler way. Abolish the Corn Laws. That is
the true commutation of Tithe. Do away with both the bread-taxes,
utterly and at once. Let the Tithe disappear and be no more heard of. A
provision, of course, must be made for lay impropriators and existing
incumbents; at present, too, the time has not yet come when the
endowments of the Church of England will be cut down to the value of the
Church lands: some equivalent, probably, will this time be given to the
clergy, for at least a portion of the Tithe. Let these expenses, then,
be borne by the nation at large. Let them be included in the estimates
of every session, with the other yearly expenses; or let stock to the
necessary amount be created for the purpose, and placed, as Lord Henley
proposes, in the name of a Parliamentary Commission.2 To grudge such a
price for the repeal of the Corn Laws, would be that penny-wisdom which
is pound-foolishness. The penny, it is true, may be taken before your
face, and the pound behind your back: yet a penny is but a penny, and a
pound is a pound.

This course, it will be found, and no other, will do justice to all.
Yet, instead of being intricate, it is the simplest—instead of being
difficult of execution, it is the easiest and most commodious—of all
means of adjustment which have been proposed. It has the advantage, rare
among reforms, that it alienates no one, not even those who profited by
the abuse, since the redress of one wrong is made to operate as an
indemnity to those who would suffer by the removal of another.

The agriculturists, indeed, if the matter were propounded in the
abstract, might question the sufficiency of the compensation. But they
could scarcely do so when their attention was drawn to the fact, to how
very low a fixed duty the present Corn Law is equivalent. The whole of
the wheat which has been imported since the act of 1828 came into force,
has paid, on an average, not more than 6s. 6d. per quarter. The Tithe,
if it were exacted in full, would, at the present average prices, be
about an equal sum. It is not so, we know, in fact; because much of the
land of the United Kingdom is either tithe-free or under a modus, and
because the parson seldom obtains his full dues. But the inconvenience,
and annoyance, and litigation arising from the tax in its present form,
Edition: current; Page: [538] are of themselves a substantive burthen
upon the occupation of a farmer, at least sufficient, we cannot but
suppose, to make up all that the Tithe falls short of a full tenth of
the produce. The gain of the Tithe, then, would be a full equivalent,
both to the landlord and the farmer, for the loss of the Corn Laws:
while, in common with the entire community, they would gain in the
cheapness of their food, and the impulse given to the industry and
wealth of the country; and the farmer, as a capitalist, would gain in
addition, along with other capitalists, in the greater facility of
maintaining his labourers.

With the exception of Tithe, there are no peculiar burthens on the
growth of food which can form a reasonable pretext for keeping up a
peculiar tax upon its importation.

The poor-rates are often erected into such a pretext, but improperly; as
is apparent for several reasons:—

In the first place, a free trade in corn, by cheapening food, will
reduce the burthen of the poor-rates. Take away the Corn Laws, then, and
you take away, to a very great extent, this argument for having Corn
Laws.

Secondly, if the poor-rates press more severely on the agriculturists
than on other people, why is this? Solely because in the purely
agricultural parishes the condition of the poor is worst, and those
abuses of the poor-laws which have pauperised and demoralised the
labouring classes have there been carried to the highest pitch. But of
these abuses the landlords themselves, in their capacity of magistrates,
have been the authors. They have no right to come upon the general
public for an indemnity from the consequences of their own ignorance and
imprudence.

Then, too, as they have been the causes of their own burthens, which by
means of Corn Laws they now strive to shift off upon other people, so it
rests with them, by reversing the cause which did the mischief, to undo
it: either by a more judicious exercise of their powers, or (and to that
they must at last come) by abdicating their functions into the hands of
wiser men. We know from the best authority, that the inquiries recently
made by the Poor Law Commission have ascertained that, in the very worst
districts of the worst counties in England, parishes exist, where the
exertions even of one wise and energetic country gentleman or clergyman
have sufficed not only to correct the maladministration, and greatly
diminish the amount, of the rates, but in a few years actually to
unpauperise the whole labouring population.3 If this can be done in one
parish, it can in another. Let the landlords then bestir themselves, or
make way for better Edition: current; Page: [539] men; and cease to
plead, as an argument for taxing every one who lives by bread (and
putting the money into their own pockets), the enormity of a burthen
which owes its very existence to their mismanagement, and which will
continue to press upon them so long and no longer than that
mismanagement shall endure.

As for the county rates, to claim “protection” on that score is absurd:
other people pay for roads, and gaols, and paving and lighting, and
police, as well as the landlords, and are not disposed to pay for
themselves and the landlords too. We shall be told, perhaps, of the
land-tax; but the landlords have no more title to be indemnified for
that than for their debts. It is not a tax taken from the landlords, for
they never had it. They bought their estates subject to that deduction
from the income. The land-tax is a rent-charge in favour of the State,
which is to that extent a co-proprietor in the soil. Besides, if the
landlords bring to account every trifle they pay to the State, we on our
side must be permitted to raise up in judgment against them every thing
that they do not pay. They have exempted their land from the legacy
duty,—a heavy tax, which is levied upon all other property without
exception.4 This fact ought to stop their mouths whenever they presume
to talk of their peculiar burthens.

Our conviction is, that if Tithes were abolished, the simultaneous
removal of the present import duties (which we regard as little if any
thing more than an equivalent for the Tithe) would not increase the
importation of corn in a perceptible degree—would not throw a single
acre out of cultivation, or a single agricultural labourer out of
employment. But if the event should prove otherwise, the course of good
sense and justice would be plain. Let it be ascertained what are the
parishes which, from the prevalence of poor soils or other causes, had
suffered by the change. Let it be found out in what parishes the rates
had greatly and suddenly increased, without any assignable cause except
the repeal of the Corn Laws. Wherever this fact could be established,
the State ought to relieve that parish from this artificial increase of
its poor, and should either assist them to emigrate, locate them on
waste lands, or provide for them other permanent employment, if any more
eligible can be found. To do that for labourers pauperised by a salutary
reform, which it has so often been in contemplation to do for the whole
surplus labouring population, is what no person with any pretensions to
reason will, we presume, object to.

There is thus every imaginable motive for joining in one great scheme of
national policy these three measures—the extinction of Tithe, the total
abolition of the Corn Laws, and a vote of credit for the emigration of
unemployed labourers, with the alternative of home colonisation. And to
this, as part of a suitable programme of the approaching session, we
invite the attention of public men.

We are fully satisfied that it would be the part of true prudence to
face all Edition: current; Page: [540] the three questions at once.
Such, however, is rarely the prudence of practical legislators. From
those in whose hands the destinies of England are for the moment placed
(though they are not worse, but, on the contrary, far better, than the
generality of public men,) we wish rather than hope for any of the
wisdom of which boldness is an ingredient. We have our fears that,
shrinking from the difficulty of dealing with more than one question at
a time, they will look only at half a question at a time; will never see
where one reform would impede, and where, on the contrary, it would help
another; and so will never accomplish any thing but some paltry
botching, which will require to be undone in a future session by
themselves or others—something which, instead of calming agitation, will
prolong it—instead of settling men’s minds, will keep them unsettled,
until they insist upon settling every thing their own way. An
exaggerated dread of innovation, at this crisis, will adjourn the
possibility of a stable government in England for an indefinite period.

But let us, in all conscience, see before we decide: let no man be
condemned untried. A great change in the constitution should make a
tabula rasa5 of past conduct and professions, and give every statesman
who chooses to claim it, a clean character to set up with. Such a
character the present ministers shall have with our hearty good will:
but beware the first spot!*


192.: FRENCH NEWS [76]
 EXAMINER, 23 DEC., 1832, P. 825

For the entry in Mill’s bibliography, see No. 181. The item, headed
“London, December 23, 1832,” is listed as “Article on France” and
enclosed in square brackets in the Somerville College set of the
Examiner.

the french minister of commerce has introduced a highly important bill
for lowering various duties on importation, and removing various
prohibitions; and in doing so, he announced that this was only the first
of a series of measures for relaxing the restrictive and prohibitory
system.1

Edition: current; Page: [541]
We suppose even the most inveterate “reciprocity” men will now be
satisfied that our relaxations of that absurd system were well judged.2
They were not only wise in themselves, but they have inspired
corresponding wisdom in the councils of other nations. The first
receding step has been taken from the mischievous measures which have
forced capital out of its natural channels in America,3 and now the
French Government has entered boldly and decidedly into a course of
liberal commercial policy.


193.: DEATH OF CHARLES LAMETH
 EXAMINER, 6 JAN., 1833, P. 8

This article, headed “London, January 6, 1833,” is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “An obituary notice of Charles Lameth in the Examiner of
6th Jany 1833” (MacMinn, p. 24). In the Somerville College set of the
Examiner, it is listed as “Article on France” and enclosed in square
brackets (including the note), with three corrections: at 542.15,
“survivors” is altered to “survivor”, at 542n.15 “Marre” is altered to
“Marne”, and at 542n.16 “Martin” is altered to “Merlin” (but “Douni” is
not corrected to “Douai”).

charles lameth is dead.1 He was one of the few survivors of the
Constituent Assembly; that illustrious body which contained within it so
much of wisdom and virtue, and to which mankind have never yet
acknowledged all the debt they owe. At the opening of the Revolution
Charles de Lameth, then a high-spirited, young officer, of noble birth
and high prospects, yet espoused warmly the cause of the Revolution. He
was the friend of Barnave,2 and along with that lofty and pure spirit,
with his own brother Alexandre de Lameth, and the most instructed and
reflecting statesman in the assembly, Adrien Duport, formed what was
then considered the extreme democratic party. Barnave, the greatest
orator but one3 of that brilliant period, perished by the guillotine,
when the Revolution (to use the Edition: current; Page: [542] words of
Danton on the scaffold) began like Saturn to devour her children.4
Duport died in exile. The two Lameths returned to France with the
Bourbons, and distinguished themselves in the côté gauche of the Chamber
of Deputies. The elder died a few years since. Charles de Lameth, always
the least conspicuous of the four in intellectual endowments, may be
pardoned if his own personal sufferings, and the disappointment of his
early enthusiastic hopes, made him go the way of the timid, and resist
the democratic tendency of the times. He was a strenuous supporter of
the juste milieu, or resistance party, after the July Revolution; but he
never was false to the recollections of his better days, and but a few
months since, he made a speech in the Chamber in affectionate
vindication of the memory of his illustrious friend Barnave.5 Peace be
with them both, and with the last immortal honour!

How few remain of that noble representative body, and these few how
various! Lafayette is still spared to us. There are still alive
Talleyrand, Sieyès, Montlosier, Roederer, Pontécoulant, the only
survivor of the proscribed Girondists; Barrère,6 the only survivor of
the terrible Committee of Public Safety:* and probably a few others whom
we remember not. None now remain of that still nobler body, the signers
of the American Declaration of Independence. The last of them, Carroll
of Carrolton, died a few months ago at a most advanced age.7

194.: THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE
 EXAMINER, 13 JAN., 1833, P. 19

In one of his rare early comments on the United States, Mill discusses
Andrew Jackson’s Fourth Annual Message of 4 Dec., 1832, reported in The
Times, 2 Jan., 1833, p. 3, where all the quotations will be found. This
item, headed as title, appears in the “Political Examiner.” It is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “An article headed ‘The President’s
Message’ in the Examiner of 13th January 1833” (MacMinn, p. 24). In the
Somerville College set of the Examiner, where it is listed as title, it
is enclosed in square brackets, with two corrections: at 544.5, “busy”
is altered to “losing”, and at 545.6 “prepared” is altered to
“proposed”.

happy will it be for britain when the annual address of her first
Magistrate on calling together her Parliament, shall be like that of the
American President—an argumentative review of all the great political
questions of the time, a full and clear, though condensed statement of
the views of the head of the Government on every subject likely to come
before the Legislature during the session, and particularly of the
grounds of all the amendments which he deems requisite in every branch
of the national institutions.

On the present occasion one of these amendments is no less than the
entire abandonment of what is called the Tariff system, in other words
the “protection” of domestic industry. General Jackson condemns the
“American system” in toto, and proposes that the idea of forcing
manufactures by means of duties should be given up, except with regard
to articles for which it would be dangerous to depend on foreigners:
(what these are, he does not specify.)

It was not too soon for Congress to begin repealing their absurd
commercial laws. The Union was on the verge of civil war. The Southern
States, having no manufactures, but exporting an immense quantity of raw
produce, suffered in a twofold manner by the Tariff; first, by being
compelled to buy dear and bad manufactures in New England, when they
could have cheap and good ones in Europe; and, secondly, by the
consequent limitation of the European market for their own commodities.
The Legislature of one of the greatest of these States, South Carolina,
has recently passed an Act, declaring that Congress has exceeded its
powers in enacting the Tariff, being authorized by the Constitution to
impose taxes for revenue only, but not for protection; and that,
consequently, the Tariff laws are inoperative, and ought not to be
obeyed.1

The President, in his message, comments in very measured terms on this
bold Edition: current; Page: [544] proceeding;2 but there is no doubt
that the Federal Government will be too strong for this single State, as
none of the other anti-Tariff States are showing any disposition to
follow the example. Let us hope, at least, that this act of resistance
will draw universal attention to the iniquity of taxing the whole
American people to enable a few manufacturers to carry on a losing
trade; and that in this, as in so many other cases, intemperate violence
may procure the redress which was denied to gentle remonstrance.

Another of the President’s suggestions appears to us of far more
questionable policy, or rather decidedly and grossly impolitic. He
declares himself in favour of giving up the revenue hitherto accruing to
the United States from the sale of unoccupied lands; and proposes that
the price be henceforth limited to an equivalent for the expence of
surveying the land and granting a title. It is curious enough that the
American Government should think of abandoning their own more rational
mode of disposing of land and adopting ours, at the very time when our
Colonial Office is abandoning its own and adopting theirs; the very
time, too, when Mr. Wakefield’s admirable pamphlets have so clearly
demonstrated that the great source of rapid growth and prosperity in a
new colony is concentration, whether produced by natural causes, or by
means artificially employed to promote it.3

The rent of land being a mere Godsent, coming into the possession of
individuals by mere occupancy, and increasing as population and wealth
increases, without any exertion on the part of the owner, ought, in all
new countries, to be reserved in the hands of the State, as a fund which
would in time be sufficient to supersede the necessity of taxation. But
if for an immediate consideration the State chooses to dispose of this
invaluable resource, it should at least put as high a price upon grants
of land as it can get. If the United States adopt the President’s
recommendation, they will give up a revenue, which costs nothing, to any
body, and which must be replaced by taxes on industry or on the profits
of capital; while they will add still further to their greatest social
evil—that rapid dispersion of the inhabitants, which keeps the people of
the more recently settled territories in a state of semibarbarism, and
is prejudicial Edition: current; Page: [545] even to what alone it can
ever have been supposed to promote—the increase of the national wealth.

Half the revenue of the last year has been applied to the liquidation of
debt; and the National Debt of the United States is now almost entirely
paid off. The small remainder consists chiefly of stock not redeemable
for two or three years to come, which however it is proposed to buy up
at the market price. The United States will then present the unique
phenomenon of a great nation entirely free from debt. Several indeed of
the State Governments have debts, but these were mostly contracted for
productive purposes, such as the construction of canals and roads. Such
debts are not like those of a spendthrift, but like those of a wealthy
manufacturer or merchant, with whom to be in debt is merely to have the
use, for profitable purposes, of other men’s capital as well as his own.
The more he is in debt the greater are his gains. Such debts make the
debtor rich instead of making him poor.


195.: NECESSITY OF REVISING THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF TAXATION
 EXAMINER, 13 JAN., 1833, PP. 19-20

This article (probably with its continuation, No. 196) is said by Mill
in his letter of 27 Dec., 1832, to have been already written (see No.
186); they are referred to again in a letter to Carlyle of 16 Jan., in
which Mill says he has written little and published only this (EL, CW,
Vol. XII, p. 141). Both are leading articles in the “Political
Examiner,” headed as title. This one is described in Mill’s bibliography
as “An article headed ‘Necessity of revising the present system of
taxation,’ in the Examiner of the same date [as No. 194]” (MacMinn, p.
24). In the Somerville College set of the Examiner, it is listed as
“Necessity of revising the present method of Taxation” and enclosed in
square brackets.

among the most urgent duties of the parliament which is about to
assemble, will be the revisal of our present fiscal system. Others of
our abuses and grievances may be equally great, some possibly greater,
but none are more palpable and glaring. We are overtaxed, and mistaxed.
To the overtaxation many eyes have long been open; to the mistaxation,
fewer. But the manner of our taxation begins at length to be thought of
by popular constituencies, as well as the amount: and the voice which is
raised for the repeal of so many taxes is not, as it was wont to be, a
mere inarticulate outcry of the overburthened, eager to have the weight
taken off their own particular shoulders, but a deliberate protest
against an unjust mode of distributing the common load, and a claim to
have the apportionment made on principle, with a due regard to the
strength and convenience of all.

The two pervading evils of most fiscal systems, and of our own among
others, are inequality and waste. There is inequality, when, to supply
the public Edition: current; Page: [546] revenue, a greater sacrifice is
required from one part of the people than from another part. There is
waste, when a needlessly large portion of the proceeds of a tax is
swallowed up in the expense of collection, or when the tax necessitates
or encourages bad processes of production, or diverts labour and capital
from the channels into which, being the most productive, they would
spontaneously flow. In the revenue system of this country all these
forms of evil abound. Nor are there wanting striking examples of a still
worse mischief, taxes operating immorally; by precluding or discouraging
the exercise of some virtue, (as the taxes on soap, and on insurance,)1
by obstructing access to wholesome instruction, (as the taxes on paper,
pamphlets, newspapers, and book advertisements,)2 or, finally, by
holding out a premium to smuggling; as is done by all high duties on
importation, and in England, particularly, by those on foreign spirits
and tobacco.3 But the objection of immorality applies to some parts only
of our revenue system; the vices of inequality and waste pervade nearly
the whole.

For instance, all our direct taxes proceed on the avowed principle of
sparing the rich: the very poor are also, in some instances, spared; but
the rich invariably. Thus the window tax stops at a certain maximum: a
limit is fixed, beyond which windows in any number may be added without
being taxed.4 The disgraceful inequalities of the house tax5 have lately
attracted universal attention, though the whole extent of them is not
even yet known to the public. The house tax besides, even if fairly
assessed according to the common standard of fairness, that is, in
proportion to the bonâ fide rent, must still be an unequal tax; for a
person of moderate income generally expends a larger proportion of that
income in the rent of his house or apartments, than the very rich: and
the houseroom a man requires is proportioned, not to his riches, but
rather to the number of his children; that is, to his poverty. The tax
on probates of wills, a most objectionable impost on many accounts,
stops, like the window tax, at a maximum.6 The same principle is carried
into some branches of our indirect taxation. Thus the stamp duty on
receipts does not rise in proportion to the amount of the sum paid: the
ascending scale stops at a certain value.7 The legacy duty presents an
inequality which, to a person unacquainted with the composition of the
legislature by whom that duty was imposed, would look like an
unaccountable anomaly: it is laid exclusively on what is called personal
property; land is exempted.8

Edition: current; Page: [547]
Further, all taxes on articles of consumption, which either nature or
universal habit has placed among the necessaries of life, are unequal in
the highest degree: for of such articles the poor consume as much, or
nearly as much, as the rich, sometimes far more. The tax on foreign
corn, considered merely as a source of revenue, and apart from its other
evils, has all the iniquity of a poll tax; for the poor man, unless he
is actually starving, must eat as much bread as the rich, and (if we
count children only, and not servants) has as many mouths to feed. The
duty on raw cotton, recently substituted for the still worse tax on the
manufactured article, is objectionable on the same ground.9 Cottons are
the dress, not so much of the rich as of the poor; and the coarser
article consumed by the poorer purchaser, contains more of the raw
material, and consequently pays a higher duty thereon, than the fine
muslins worn by the higher ranks.

Not only is inequality chargeable upon nearly the whole of our taxes,
but from the additional evil of waste, in some one or other of its
forms, very few of them are exempt. There are not many of our excise
duties which do not subject the producers or dealers to vexatious and
burthensome regulations, interfering, in many ways, with the best and
cheapest processes of production. Our custom duties cause much
unnecessary expense and annoyance to the merchants, for which the latter
indemnify themselves at the cost of the consumer; and so far as those
duties affect articles which can be produced in the country itself, or
in the colonies, they are almost always purposely shaped to protect (as
the phrase is) home and colonial industry; a term which always means, to
set home or colonial industry upon producing some particular article
(which it would not naturally take to) in preference to producing some
other article, through the medium of which it could obtain the first in
greater quantity and at a less expense. The loss to the mother country,
from the discriminating duties on timber alone,10 is moderately
estimated at a million sterling a-year. The measure, an approximation to
which the machinations of the Tories defeated in 1831,11 would, if
carried, have saved such a sum to the nation, as would have enabled us,
without adding to any of the public burthens, to get rid of all the
taxes on knowledge at one blow.

We had no intention to enter into a minute analysis of the vices of our
revenue system; as a brief abstract the above may suffice. The question
of most moment is, seeing the badness of most of the existing taxes,
seeing, at the same time, that taxes of some one or other kind must be
had, what should they be?

On this matter a principle is establishing itself in the public mind,
which we consider an extremely salutary one; that among the modes of
raising a revenue, those are commonly the most eligible which are the
most direct. A tax which Edition: current; Page: [548] blends itself
with the price of a commodity has indeed the seeming advantage, that by
consenting to forego the use of the commodity it is possible to escape
the tax, while from a direct tax on income or on property there is no
escape: and this, no doubt, is one of the causes why a nation will
submit to be taxed much more heavily when the taxes come in that shape.
But this increased willingness to endure a burthen, which hitherto has
almost always been too readily borne, is at least a doubtful advantage.
On the other hand, the more direct you make your taxation—that is, the
nearer you approach to making the person who is to pay it ultimately,
pay it at once and avowedly—the greater is your security both against
inequality and against waste. In the case of all indirect taxes, there
is an apparent uncertainty hanging over the question, who pays them? an
uncertainty at least sufficient to leave room for doubt and cavil; so
that there being no sure standard acknowledged by all, to determine the
real weight with which the taxes fall on different classes of the
payers, an excuse may always be found for overcharging those who ought,
on the contrary, to be relieved. We had an example of this in Lord
Althorp’s budget, when it was proposed to tax the fundholder on the
unfounded hypothesis that he was greatly undertaxed.12 It is further to
be remarked, that all taxes on commodities, and on the transfer of
commodities, have more or less effect in diverting production from its
natural and most beneficial course; independently of which, by limiting
the demand for the taxed article, they operate as a discouragement to
all those improvements in production, which in order to be introduced
with advantage, require that the productive operations should be on a
large scale.

Taxes, therefore, ought, if possible, to be direct. But a direct tax, if
it aims at equality at all, must be a property tax. To a property tax,
therefore, we must come. There are difficulties of detail in valuing the
different kinds of property, and assessing them to the revenue so as to
avoid inequality, without doing violence to the feelings of individuals.
But, to surmount these difficulties, we cannot believe anything more to
be necessary, than that the practical skill and sagacity which exist in
the community, should fairly turn themselves to the task. That skill and
sagacity daily effect things far more difficult. In the meanwhile, now
is the time for clearing up thoroughly the question of principle;
setting right every incorrectness in any of the conceptions commonly
entertained of a property tax, and rendering the idea of such a tax
definite and tangible. And this we propose to attempt in our next
number.13

196.: ERRORS AND TRUTHS ON A PROPERTY TAX
 EXAMINER, 27 JAN., 1833, PP. 51-2

Under the title appears “(Continued from the week before last.)”; for
the first half, see No. 195. The item is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “An article in continuation of the foregoing [No. 195]
and headed ‘Errors and Truths in a Property Tax’ in the Examiner of 27th
January 1833, and signed A.B.” (MacMinn, p. 24). It is listed as title
and enclosed in square brackets in the Somerville College set of the
Examiner.

two contrary errors prevail with respect to a property tax. One of these
was realized in practice, when a tax actually existed bearing that
name:1 the other is of recent growth, and is the logical opposite of the
former. Both arise out of an indistinctness of meaning in the word
property.

When we speak of a man’s property, we sometimes mean all that is his;
all that constitutes his means of living; all he has to spend and to
save. But sometimes the term is confined to actual accumulations; the
saleable value of what he has actually belonging to him at any given
instant. Thus, a physician or lawyer who gains 5000l. a-year by his
practice, and spends it all, may be said in one sense to be a man of
property; to have a property equal, or bearing some proportion to, the
price of an annuity of that amount upon his life. But in the other
sense, he may have no property, except the furniture of his house, and
whatever other articles he may have momentarily in his possession for
immediate use.

Now it would be a monstrous absurdity and injustice to enact that this
man, though benefiting as much by legal protection as any other man in
the nation, should remain untaxed merely because he spends all he gets;
while the expense of protecting him is thrown upon the man who saves, to
provide for old age or for a family, or to have leisure to employ
himself in literature, science, or works of benevolence. On the other
hand, it seems equally monstrous that one whose income is derived from
his personal exertions, and depends on the continuance of his life,
should be taxed at the same rate as he who derives his from land or
capital, which remain permanently with him and can be transmitted to his
descendants. Yet these contrary errors, that of leaving the wages of all
kinds of labour untaxed, and that of taxing the earnings of labour at
the same per centage as the income from land or stock, have gained a
footing in many minds; and the latter, when the income tax existed in
this kingdom, had established itself in our laws. The last circumstance,
indeed, will surprise no one, who duly considers by whom those laws were
made.

If there is to be a property tax, all income ought to be considered as
property; but a temporary income ought to be deemed a less valuable
property than a Edition: current; Page: [550] permanent one. It may be
said, indeed, that if an income worth ten years’ purchase pays a given
per centage for ten years, and an income worth twenty years’ purchase
pays the same per centage for twenty years, the just proportion of
taxation is observed, since there is the same ratio between the two
payments as there is between the values of the two incomes. And this is
true, if we confine our attention to a mere numerical equality; but not
if we consider what is alone of any importance, equality of pressure
upon the feelings of individuals. Suppose two men with equal incomes,
one arising from land or capital, which can be transmitted to
descendants, the other terminating with the life of the possessor: these
two persons cannot afford to live in the same style of expence. The one
may without imprudence spend his whole income; the other must lay by a
part, as a provision for his children after his decease. It would be
injustice if two men who for no purpose of comfort or enjoyment are
equally rich, were to be treated as such solely for purposes of
taxation.

The tax should, therefore, be so adjusted upon the person whose income
is derived from the earnings of labour, as to enable him to exercise the
forethought which duty requires of him, and does not require of the
other, without any greater sacrifice of personal comforts and
indulgences than is demanded from the owner of the permanent income. It
would be impossible, indeed, to adapt the rate of taxation to the
peculiarities of every individual case. There is no alternative but to
be content with an average, and (what must so often be done in
legislation) to cut the knot which it is found impracticable to untie.
If a man whose income depends on his personal exertions, supposing him
to live for the ordinary length of time, and to have the ordinary number
of children, ought in prudence to lay by, throughout life (say)
one-tenth part of his income; then an income of one hundred pounds, from
the earnings of labour, ought to pay no more to the state, than an
income of ninety pounds from a permanent source. By taking some such
estimate as this for the foundation of a general rule, justice would be
done in gross, though not in detail: to the class of labourers, though
not to every individual contained in the class.

Reasons of an analogous kind may, perhaps, be found for taxing the
incomes which persons in business derive from their stock in trade, at a
lower percentage than those of the landholder, the fundholder, and other
persons who can live in idleness, and whose income is not liable to
vary. The income of a person in trade is partly the reward of his
personal exertions, and comes within the proviso already made in favour
of incomes which are the earnings of labour. It is also precarious, in a
peculiar degree: and in the same manner as we would exempt from taxation
that portion of income which prudence requires should be laid by as a
provision for children, there seems equal reason for exempting such
other portion, as may be considered equivalent to an insurance against
peculiar risks or casualties.

But, if we may judge from newspapers, many well-meaning persons who
Edition: current; Page: [551] desire a property tax, seem to understand
by it a tax which is to fall solely upon landed and funded property,
money lent, and (sometimes) stock in trade, and not at all (as the
phrase is) upon industry. This doctrine appears to us fundamentally
erroneous: yet in the prevalence of it we see proof of a very gratifying
fact, namely, that there is no danger whatever of a confiscation of the
funds. The demand for relief from taxes has taken another direction. A
less noxious error, though still an error, has supplanted that worst of
errors. The cry is not, to throw the whole load of the national debt on
a single class, the fundholders, whose incomes are mostly small or
moderate, and the bonâ fide earning of honest industry; but to lay this,
together with the other public burthens, upon the collective body of the
owners of accumulated property. The injustice here is far less heinous,
because, being spread over a much larger body of persons, it would fall
less heavily upon each: that body including, moreover, all the richest,
and none of the absolutely poor. Still it is injustice, for it is
partial taxation. The man who lives by his exertions, benefits by the
existence of government as much as he who subsists by his accumulations,
or by the accumulations of his forefathers. Without legal protection,
the one could no more get what he spends, than the other could keep what
he has saved: and both ought to contribute in the just ratio of their
ability, to the support of that without which the existence of both
would be alike precarious. Furthermore, a partial tax of the kind
proposed would be a penalty on prudence; an encouragement held out to
every man to dissipate all he gets, by taxing him if he saves, and
leaving him untaxed if he squanders. And as the fund from which all
labourers subsist while they labour, is derived from the savings of
former labour, it may be judged what kind of relief that is, which could
be afforded to industry by a tax on saving.

There is one case, and no more, in which the justice of laying an
exclusive contribution on accumulations actually made, might admit of a
valid defence. If a great national effort were to be made for paying off
the national debt, there would be much to be said for demanding the
sacrifice exclusively from the owners of property already in existence,
and not requiring those whose sole property is their labour, to mortgage
the future earnings of that labour in order to defray their share. The
pecuniary engagements of a government (it may with much show of justice
be contended) are a mortgage upon the property which existed in the
country when those engagements were entered into. It is for him who
inherited his father’s property to pay his father’s debts. In public as
in private, the heir or successor is freed from the burthen of
fulfilling his predecessor’s obligations, if he faithfully gives up the
whole of the inheritance to the creditors.

We rather invite attention to this argument, than express any opinion as
to its conclusiveness. The strongest objection to it which we can
anticipate, is the impossibility of distinguishing, after the lapse of
years, property inherited, from property acquired by industry and
frugality since the national debt was Edition: current; Page: [552]
contracted. Property accumulated during the interval, would have as good
a title to exemption on the principle laid down, as property to be
acquired hereafter. In proportion as the latter was relieved, the
burthen would press heavier upon the former; and we seem to be placed in
the alternative of continuing to do a smaller injustice to a larger
number, or beginning to do a greater injustice to a smaller number.

A notice of motion was given on the last day of the session, by Mr. W.B.
Evans, (who, we regret to observe, has retired from parliament,) for
throwing the national debt upon property.2 Mr. Evans was probably moved
to this proceeding by some such arguments as those we have now thrown
out. But we must suggest to him that this idea, however good for paying
off the national debt, is altogether unfit to be adopted in merely
paying the interest of it. For, that way, the tax would extend to future
accumulations as well as past: the burthen would not be taken off the
coming generation, but, on the contrary, would be imposed with double
weight upon as many of that generation as save. Those alone who spend
all they get, and, as far as depends on themselves, add nothing
permanently to the national wealth, would in consideration of their
prodigality, and of their comparative uselessness to society, obtain
exemption from the heaviest of the national burthens. This, therefore,
would be not only in every way an inequitable, but a highly immoral tax.

There remains the question of what is called a graduated property tax;
that is, a tax which demands from the larger incomes not only a larger
quantity, but a larger proportion than from the smaller ones. We have
not left ourselves space to treat this question at any length, and we
will merely suggest the leading considerations which influence our own
minds.

All persons who profess any regard for justice or morality, are
advocates, at least in words, of equal taxation. To tax any class
exclusively, though it be the class of rich; or to tax any class in a
greater proportion than other classes, all men admit to be unjust. Now
primâ facie it would appear that the only mode of taxing all members of
the community equally, is to take the same percentage from all property
alike; whatever that per centage be, whether the twentieth penny, (to
use the ancient expression,) the hundredth penny, or the thousandth.

To this, however, it is answered, that equal taxation consists not in
taking equal proportions from the incomes of individuals, but in taking
equal proportions from their enjoyments. If you abstract from a rich man
one-tenth of his income, and from a poor man one-tenth of his, you
demand a greater sacrifice of enjoyment from the poor man than from the
rich. The one you only compel to forego some object of fancy or luxury,
while to the other you may cause actual physical distress.

Edition: current; Page: [553]
Up to a certain point there is truth in this. If from the man who has
only ten shillings a-week you take one shilling, he is probably put to
greater inconvenience than the man who has 1000l. a-year and from whom
you demand 100l. But why? Because in the case of the poorer man the tax
trenches upon the actual necessaries of life; upon the things which
nature, not custom or convention, has rendered indispensable. If the tax
spares actual necessaries, the maxim no longer holds: beyond that point
it is scarcely true that numerical equality is real inequality.
One-tenth of each man’s superfluities would seem to be no heavier tax on
one man than on another, whatever may be the difference in their
fortunes. And by superfluities we mean all that they possess beyond what
suffices for the natural wants common to all mankind. Of artificial
wants, created by fashion or habit, legislation can in this case take no
cognizance; for if these be taken into the account, there are no such
things as superfluities. Every class has its own standard of the
comforts and indulgences necessary to its station; a standard
proportional to its income, and usually determined by what that income
is: and if, in deference to such conventional wants, the burthen of
taxation were lightened upon any class, the sole effect would be to
raise the conventional standard so much the higher.

Our plan therefore would be, to relieve the smaller incomes from direct
taxation entirely, up to the income which might be deemed fully
sufficient to satisfy those physical wants of a human being which are
independent of habit and convention: to keep off hunger and cold, and
provide for old age, and for the ordinary chances of sickness, or other
inability to work. Having fixed this minimum for entire exemption, we
would tax all permanent incomes exceeding this, in exact proportion to
the excess. Thus, if 50l. a-year be the minimum, (we take the figures at
random,) if it be deemed that any man, with a family such as all men
might have without overstocking the labour market, cannot exist, free
from physical discomfort, upon less than 50l.; incomes of that amount,
or less, should be exempted from the tax, while all others should be
taxed a certain per centage on whatever surplus they possess beyond 50l.
If, for example, the tax were ten per cent., a man with 60l. a-year
should pay out of the odd ten, one pound; the man of 100l. a-year, of
the odd fifty, five pounds; the man of 1000l. a-year, of the odd 950,
ninety-five. This kind of graduated property tax appears to us to be
just, and no other. We would apply the same principle to incomes of
temporary duration, such as those derived from the earnings of industry;
with the reservation already made, that of leaving untaxed such portion
of the income as ought to be saved to form the inheritance of
descendants. If this portion be estimated at one-tenth,* the taxable
part of the income of a professional man would be not the whole but
nine-tenths only of the surplus which he earns beyond Edition: current;
Page: [554] 50l. a-year; upon these nine-tenths however we would levy
the same per centage as upon income from a permanent source.

We would not, however, leave all incomes below a given minimum wholly
untaxed; we are inclined to retain a few such taxes on luxuries, at any
rate on stimulants, as might by possibility touch those lowest incomes.
It is but just that the indulgence which we suppose the state to extend
to a poor man, because all his income is required for actual
necessaries, should be contingent upon his really so expending it; and
that if he thinks fit to encroach upon his own or his family’s
necessaries, for the purchase of mere indulgences, he should contribute
his share to the public revenue like the rest of the community. It is
equally just that if the owner of a life income chooses to spend on his
pleasures that proportion of his income which the state exempts from
direct taxation, on the presumption that it is to be saved, he should,
by means of that very expenditure, contribute indirectly to the
necessities of the state, through taxes on consumption.

197.: FLOWER’S HYMN OF THE POLISH EXILES
 EXAMINER, 17 FEB., 1833, P. 101

After the military revolt late in 1830 against Russian domination was
put down in September 1831, the rebel leaders were exiled to Siberia;
many other Poles took part in the “great emigration” of the 1830s to
1850s to France, Britain, and other countries. Mill’s review of Eliza
Flower’s Hymn of the Polish Exiles by the Siberian Sea (London: Novello
and Fox, 1833) indicates his political sympathies as well as his
interest in music (he played the piano and composed airs for his own
pleasure), and his continuing encouragement of the work of Miss Flower
(see Nos. 112 and 155). The review, in the “Musical” section, is headed
“Hymn of the Polish Exiles by the Siberian Sea; composed by the Author
of ‘Musical Illustrations of the Waverley Novels,’ ‘Songs of the
Seasons,’ &c. The words from ‘The Charmed Sea,’ a Tale, by Harriet
Martineau.” The Charmed Sea was No. 13 of the Illustrations of Political
Economy, 9 vols. (London: Fox, 1833) by Harriet Martineau (1802-76), the
prolific writer who was at this time contributing essays to the Monthly
Repository for W.J. Fox. The “Hymn” that provided Flower’s text is on p.
104 of The Charmed Sea. The review is described in Mill’s bibliography
as “A notice of Miss Flower’s ‘Hymn of the Polish Exiles’ in the
Examiner of 17th February 1833” (MacMinn, p. 25). In the Somerville
College set of the Examiner, it is similarly listed (“Review” replacing
“A notice”) and enclosed in square brackets.

the words of this hymn or prayer, notwithstanding some faults, were not
unworthy to be chosen by Miss Flower, as the vehicle of one of her
inspired strains: and Miss Martineau, or any one else who writes with a
meaning, may be congratulated on meeting with a composer who is able and
resolved to make that meaning felt, even when the collocation and rhythm
of the words renders this a Edition: current; Page: [555] task of some
difficulty. The skilful manner in which the unpleasant effect of a fault
in the metre of the first line is obviated in the music, exemplifies our
remark.

The air is an Adagio in C minor, terminating in a chorus, and its
expression accords with the imploring, desponding, yet not despairing
character belonging to the words and to the situation. The composer has
shown her usual command over the resources of her art, both in respect
to harmony and modulation. The concluding passage, “Give us our heritage
again,” is highly characteristic and beautiful. [P. 4.]

It is proper to mention that this composition, which, by the ordinary
tricks of publishers, might easily have been spread over at least two
sheets, is compressed into the compass of one.1 It is printed, not
engraved, and is sold for one shilling. We trust that this low price
will be made up for by extensive circulation, and that the song will
contribute largely to the diffusion of that sympathy with Polish heroism
and misfortune, which may still administer consolation for the woes it
cannot remedy.


198.: THE MONTHLY REPOSITORY FOR MARCH 1833
 EXAMINER, 17 MAR., 1833, PP. 164-5

This is the first of six eulogistic notices by Mill (see Nos. 200, 207,
214, 225, and 229) of the Monthly Repository, a journal founded in 1806
as a Unitarian organ but transformed under the editorship (1828 to 1836)
of Mill’s friend W.J. Fox into a wide-ranging journal of literature and
politics. Mill himself had begun to contribute to the journal with “On
Genius” in October 1832, followed by “What Is Poetry?” in January; he
had nothing in the March number. The attack on marriage law in the
notice may be compared with the contemporary essays on marriage by Mill
and Harriet Taylor (CW, Vol. XXI, pp. 35-49 and 375-7). The review, in
the “Literary Examiner,” is headed “The Monthly Repository for March
1833 [n.s. VII]. Edited by W.J. Fox”; the references are to this volume.
The review is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A notice in the
Examiner of 17th March 1833 of the number of the ‘Monthly Repository’
for the same month, incl. [sic]” (MacMinn, p. 25). In the Somerville
College set of the Examiner, it is listed as “Review of the Monthly
Repository for March 1833” and enclosed in square brackets.

this valuable periodical, though its reputation and influence are
rapidly extending, has not yet made so much way among the general
public, as it will when it is better known; chiefly, as we believe, from
the impression that, although conducted by the least sectarian of all
ministers of religion, it is still in some degree what it once was
avowedly, the organ of the theological opinions of a sect. Mr. Fox,
however, is well known as a man with whom religion is not a thing apart,
an interest which supersedes and excludes all others, but one which
Edition: current; Page: [556] heightens and purifies them; in whose
estimation the duty of a christian man or of a christian teacher, is not
to abstain from worldly concerns, but to pursue them in an unworldly
spirit. With him, the temporal welfare of man and the eternal are not
two objects conflicting and contradictory, but the first is part and
parcel of the last; the last, but the prolongation and amplification of
the first. Reversing the order in which commonplace divines present the
two ideas, he holds, not that human beings will best perform their duty
here by keeping the internal eye constantly fixed in mystical
contemplation upon hereafter; but that whatever is best calculated to
fit mankind for this world, fits them best also for the world to come.

It would be strange if under such editorship a work could be sectarian.
The controversial theology which occupied a large part of the pages of
the Repository under the former management, is now banished to a
separate publication, the Unitarian Chronicle;1 and the Repository has
so completely divested itself of its original character, that the
Unitarian Association, we are informed, have withdrawn their patronage
from it; not from any disapprobation of its principles or tendencies,
but on the declared ground that it is no longer a religious work.

A moral and political magazine, which in politics and legislation
stedfastly advocates the principles of the philosophic reformers; which
carries the same principles of really conservative reform through the
whole range of social morality; and which, along with all that tends to
improve the physical state and social relations of man, includes
likewise in its comprehensive aim all that can elevate, refine, and
beautify the individual mind; such a work ought not to be looked shyly
upon by the general reader on suspicion of being sectarian, while it is
losing the support of sectarians precisely because it is not so.

The most remarkable paper in the number which has just appeared—we might
say one of the most remarkable which have appeared in any periodical for
many months—is the recital, with its appropriate commentary, of an “ower
true tale”2—the authentic history of the life of Mehetabel Wesley, a
sister of the celebrated founder of Methodism.3 The writer has here
given us the deeply affecting and most instructive narrative of the
sufferings of a being formed to give and to enjoy happiness such as few
are capable of, but whose life, from infancy till death, was a continued
martyrdom. She was one of the most to be pitied of the victims of whom
whole hecatombs have been and are sacrificed, first to a narrow and
bigoted and chilling education, aiming deliberately to crush Edition:
current; Page: [557] all independent exercise of the faculties whether
of heart or of understanding: and next to a marriage-law, which, as at
present constituted, is one of the worst of our social institutions—a
law which permits the stronger party to evade with impunity every one of
the essentials of the contract, while the misery of an ill-assorted
union is left to press upon the weaker with unmitigated burden, and
without a hope of relief, unless purchased by what the world have
stamped as infamy.

Mehetabel Wesley had the misfortune “of being born into what is called a
well-regulated family.” [P. 165.] After an animated description of the
highly correct and respectable formalists whom she had the unhappiness
to call father and mother,4 the writer proceeds as follows:

Under such auspices was the gentle, fragile, playful, lovely, loving,
and sensitive Mehetabel Wesley ushered into the world. She sprang up
like the chance seedling of a delicate acacia between the cold hard
pebbles of a well-rolled gravel walk, in a square bedded garden, with
its formal box and thorny fence, there to be trained, nailed up, and
crucified to an iron frame, or a varnished brick-wall, and be tortured,
chilled, and wither; beautiful even in her drooping and her death. Her
first calamity was what there are too many who would still regard as the
best of all possible educations. The industrious Mrs. Wesley, the
paragon of moral and religious mothers, was soon hard at work upon her.
The plans pursued are minutely detailed in a letter from the good lady
herself, which is preserved as an almost infallible directory. It
describes the law, order, and duty system, the fear, honour, reverence,
and obey plan in its most complete development. Every thing is summed up
in submission; submission of heart, mind, and limb, in thought, word,
will, and deed.

[Pp. 166-7.]

Mrs. Wesley’s one thing needful5 in the education of children was to
conquer their will.

To inform the understanding (we quote her words) is a work of time, and
must proceed with children by slow degrees, as they are able to bear it;
but the subjecting the will is a thing that must be done at once, and
the sooner the better.

[P. 167; Fox’s parenthesis.]

Not one suspicion that it is possible in education to form and guide the
will through the agency of the affections, ever seems to have crossed
the mind of this paragon of mothers.

We had marked for extraction a passage which not only all parents but
all human beings should lay to heart—a protest, noble in thought and
animated in expression, against this servile and brutalizing theory of
education, the favourite theory even now of the ascetic school of
religionists. [Pp. 168-70.] But our readers should be readers of this
admirable paper in its original integrity, not in such fragments as
space permits us to transcribe.

Edition: current; Page: [558]
It was not, indeed, in the power even of Mrs. Wesley and her
well-regulated family to crush the feelings, or altogether deaden the
intellect of a being in whom “the spirit of love could not be
quenched—it was in her very frame;” [p. 170] but what her wretched
education could do to corrupt such a being it accomplished; it did
pervert her opinions; it taught her that the subjugation of her own
will, and the sacrifice of the entire happiness of her life to the
arbitrary commands and to the noxious superstitions of others, was a
religious duty. Here was the primary evil; in this lay the origin of “a
costly wreck of thoughts, feelings, hopes, and capacities of enjoyment,
which surely nothing in nature rendered necessary or unavoidable,” [p.
170] and which needed not even thus to have been so utter and so
hopeless, had not the institutions which pass for the highest and
holiest safeguards of morality, predetermined that, for the most
heart-withering of all miseries, though nature allows a remedy, law
should allow none.

In the bitterness of a disappointment in love, she made a vow to marry
the first man who offered himself to her. “A creature as low in mind as
in condition, ignorant and grovelling,” wholly illiterate and wholly
unfeeling,—“a Caliban civilized into vulgarity by the pot-house, had the
audacity to offer the violence of marriage to this Miranda, and her
father compelled her to submit to the brutality. His enforcement of his
daughter’s vow in misery, was far worse than Jephtha’s consummation of
his own vow in blood.” [P. 172.]6 The importunities of her whole family,
who would have regarded the breach of this irrational vow as one of the
deadliest of sins, prevailed over a will “effectually broken down” [p.
174] by the notable education of her notable mother, and she offered
herself up as a sacrifice.

The victim is bound to the altar. A brand never to be erased marks her
for the property of a brute. The truthful burst of agony from the lips
of disappointed love was false in its form of expression, and
superstition has made it a spell whereby to conjure up more vows, which
are false in essence, and defy volition, which pledge her for ever to
love the unlovely, and honour the dishonoured, and obey what there were
immorality in not resisting. It is done; and the long train of hopeless
years commence their lagging march through a world whose beauty should
only echo the voice of joy and singing; a wretched procession, in tears
and anguish, slow winding to the grave.—And this endured, or rather she
endured, through the quarter of a century. It was only in the six and
twentieth year of her suffering, that she was dismissed to tell Milton
in heaven that his doctrine was still immoral upon earth.

[P. 174.]7

For the greater part of that period “she lived in the hope of death.”
[P. 176.] Edition: current; Page: [559] Well and truly does the writer
say of this state of endurance, that “it cannot be read of or imagined
without acute sympathy or irrepressible indignation.” [P. 171.]

We will not weaken by any words of ours the impression which must be
left upon all minds not utterly callous, by the lofty and moving
eloquence of the concluding passage: a passage in which (as indeed in
the whole article) the noble soul of the writer actually shines through
his words.

Mehetabel Wesley was the victim, as woman is yet continually the victim,
of bad education, perverted religion, and unequal institution. The finer
the individual nature, the more costly is the sacrifice. The feeling,
taste, mental power, and moral purity, which some of her poems, and many
passages of her life indicate, are such as to prove her capability, in
favourable circumstances, of ministering most largely to social
improvement and enjoyment, and, at the same time, to individual
happiness, and of having both blessings amply measured back into her own
bosom. And all this was wasted upon one for whom a comely scullion, with
not a thought above her avocation, would have been as satisfactory a
companion, probably much more so, and would have received from him much
better treatment. How is this? Her brothers would have said that it
pleased Heaven sorely to try her; and that is true as far as it goes;
but we rather think it also pleases Heaven to show by this, and similar
examples, that the true morality, that which conducts to happiness, is
not always correctly interpreted by society, not even by that portion of
society which claims to be eminently religious. The restraint which
crippled her faculties, the awful rod which made her an infant slave,
was an immorality. This was the source of her own errors. The twig was
twisted, and so grew the tree, though graceful even in its distortion.
Her marriage was an immorality. So was her continuing through life in a
sexual companionship where mutual affection was impossible; not that she
was conscious of viciousness, but the contrary; she no doubt thought her
misery was her duty. Ill fare the machinery that wrought the perversion
and the suffering. For woman so situated there ought to be redress, open
and honourable redress, in every country that calls itself civilized.
Her situation was even worse than if she had committed that act which,
by the law of Moses, would have subjected her to death by stoning;8 for
then she might have been liberated from an enforced and intolerable
bond, and even have entered on a new state, perchance of the affection
and enjoyment for which she was framed. But her mind was enslaved; it
had been scourged into the faith that she was a property, and not a
being; her father had divorced himself for a twelvemonth; her husband
probably did worse; but she never suspected reciprocity of right or
equality of will. And they never suspected that there was degradation in
the species of mastery which they arrogated. Savage man kicks and beats
woman, and makes her toil in the fields; semi-civilized man locks her up
in a harem; and man three-quarters civilized, which is as far as we are
got, educates her for pleasure and dependency, keeps her in a state of
pupilage, closes against her most of the avenues of self-support, and
cheats her by the false forms of an irrevocable contract into a life of
subservience to his will. The reason for all which is “that he is the
stronger.” And the result of which is that he often lacks an intelligent
and sympathizing companion when most he needs one; a high-minded
helpmate to cheer him in noble toils and bitter sacrifices; and a mother
for his children who will take care that the next generation shall
advance on the mental and moral attainments of the present. Truly he
makes as bad a bargain as he deserves.

199.: FRENCH NEWS [77]
 EXAMINER, 31 MAR., 1833, P. 201

After a three-month gap, explained in his opening sentence, Mill here
returns to French politics, though not on a weekly basis; his next
summary, No. 204, was published five weeks later, on 5 May, as suggested
in his concluding sentence. The article, headed “London, March 31,
1833,” is described in his bibliography as “The summary of French
affairs in the Examiner of 31st March 1833” (MacMinn, p. 25). In the
Somerville College set of the Examiner, it is listed as “Article on
France” and enclosed in square brackets.

we have discontinued of late our usual notices of French affairs,
because all which has been doing in that country is so paltry, so devoid
alike of any importance in the immediate result, and of any indication
respecting the future, that we felt no inducement to record in our
columns, in addition to the trivialities of our own country, the still
smaller trivialities of another country, which, as foreigners, we have
so little power of shaming into better things. The national subscription
for M. Laffitte compels us to break our silence.1 Here, at least, is a
manifestation worthy of the better days of France. As the French have
been more fortunate than ourselves in the number of their examples of
eminent public and private virtue in high stations, so the generosity of
their national character has been more conspicuously called forth in
behalf of such in the time of need. M. Laffitte is now enjoying the
highest reward, next to his own self-approbation, of a life of unsullied
and consistent nobleness in all public relations, and of a beneficence
as unbounded as it was judicious and considerate, in the employment of a
large fortune. The announcement for sale of his splendid mansion in the
street which bears his name, (owing to the loss of almost all his
property by the commercial crisis consequent upon the Revolution of
1830,) has been the occasion for this testimony of affectionate
gratitude, in which the many whom he has personally obliged, often to
the extent of saving them from ruin, participate with all classes of his
countrymen,—from the banker, M. Aguado,2 with his munificent
contribution of four thousand pounds, to the workman of the faubourgs
with his one or two francs. The subscription bids fair, even in these
times of apathy and discouragement, to rival that for the orphan
children of General Foy.3

The French Government has declared its intention of convoking the
Chambers Edition: current; Page: [561] for a second session this year,
in order to vote the budget of 1834, that the salutary practice may be
resumed of voting each year’s estimates in the year preceding.4 The
present session is therefore likely soon to close; perhaps without
having effected a single important legislative improvement: certainly
without having passed a fifth part of the bills, on subjects of the
first magnitude, which have been laid before the two houses. The
ministry (if ministry it can be called, which is only the king and a set
of clerks,) appears to have a firm hold of office: the chamber has no
wish to turn them out, though it has given them several most unpalatable
checks; by making serious alterations in some of their bills, refusing
various money grants, and several times disallowing expenses which had
been already incurred: these will doubtless be covered by part of the
immense amount of secret service money which the Chamber complaisantly
grants. When the prorogation takes place, we shall give a brief summary
of the results of the session:5 they really are not worth an earlier or
a more detailed notice.


200.: THE MONTHLY REPOSITORY FOR APRIL 1833
 EXAMINER, 14 APR., 1833, PP. 229-30

For the first of Mill’s notices of the Monthly Repository, see No. 198.
Mill’s own “Writings of Junius Redivivus” was in the April number of the
Monthly Repository. This review, in the “Literary Examiner,” is headed
“The Monthly Repository for April [n.s. VII]”; the page numbers refer to
this volume. The review is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A short
notice in the Examiner of 14th April 1833 of the number of the Monthly
Repository for the same month” (MacMinn, p. 26). In the Somerville
College set of the Examiner, it is listed as “Notice of the Monthly
Repository for April” and enclosed in square brackets.

this we think decidedly the best number which has yet appeared of Mr.
Fox’s excellent periodical. There is no one article in it of the
surpassing merit which distinguished the affecting paper in the last
number on Mehetabel Wesley;1 but the general average is decidedly higher
than in that number; none of the articles, perhaps, are without some
kind or degree of merit and usefulness, and several are almost too good
to be limited to the transitory and perishable existence of articles in
a magazine. Among these we must include the paper on the life,
character, and writings of Dr. Priestley, the last of three articles on
the same subject, exhibiting Edition: current; Page: [562] very
considerable philosophical attainments and unusual skill in the analysis
of character.2

There are many passages in this and other articles well worthy of
extraction, but we prefer to copy out the following verses, which
express feelings such as all poets must have expressed, with a perfect
truth and yet with an originality of manner which marks, even in so
slight a production, real genius:

-   

    To Kathleen

-   

    -   

        Thou hast jetty eyes in brightness glancing,
    -   

        Glossy ringlets in the free air dancing,
    -   

        Cheek from rose to lily ever changing,
    -   

        As thro’ feeling’s world thy thought is ranging.

-   

    -   

        Thou bringest gifts of Nature’s fairest treasure
    -   

        To those who reckon every flower a pleasure
    -   

        Dewy darlings! exquisite creations!
    -   

        E’en their shadows seem to have sensations.

-   

    -   

        Yet should beauty fade, and flowers wither,
    -   

        I will bid thee ever welcome hither;
    -   

        Though every charm beside were from thee parted,
    -   

        Thou hast that best of all—thou’rt honest-hearted.

-   

    -   

        Then welcome, Kathleen, whatsoe’er thou bringest,
    -   

        Welcome hither when this way thou wingest,
    -   

        Not for eye, or cheek, or dewy blossom,
    -   

        But the heart thou wear’st within thy bosom.3


201.: FLOWER’S MIGNON’S SONG AND WHEN THOU WERT HERE
 EXAMINER, 21 APR., 1833, P. 245

For Mill’s previous notices of Flower, see Nos. 112, 155, and 197. This
review is in the “Music” section, where it is headed “1. Mignon’s Song;
or, A foreign sky above. By the Author of the Musical Illustrations of
the Waverley novels, &c. 2. When thou wert here. Ballad, composed by the
same author. Both published by J. Alfred Novello. [London, 1833.]” The
words to the second song are by Sarah Flower, Eliza Flower’s sister. It
is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A short notice of two of Miss
Flower’s songs, in the Examiner of 21st April 1833” (MacMinn, p. 26). In
the Somerville College set of the Edition: current; Page: [563]
Examiner, it is listed as “Review of two of Miss Flower’s songs” and
enclosed in square brackets, with one correction: at 563.18, “related”
is altered to “selected”.

two beautiful songs, worthy of the genius and taste of the composer.
Like all her other works they strike less at first hearing than they
delight on a more familiar knowledge.

The second will perhaps add most to the composer’s musical reputation,
being in a style more unlike her other compositions, and perhaps better
calculated for general popularity. But the Song of Mignon is by far the
most touching. This is not the well-known Kennst du das Land, which
Beethoven, not very successfully, set to music, but an expansion and
paraphrase of a shorter and still more affecting passage from the same
work of Goethe.1 It begins thus:

-   

    A foreign sky above
-   

    A foreign earth below me,
-   

    To the south I look all day—
-   

    For the friends who love and know me
-   

    Are far, far away!
-   

    [P. 2.]

Words more adapted to musical expression never fell to the lot or were
selected by the judgment of a composer. Miss Flower has entered fully
into their spirit. The exquisitely pathetic close of the passage “the
friends who love and know me are far, far away,” is in the best style of
Spohr,2 one of whose loveliest passages it resembles, but without
anything approaching to plagiarism.


202.: THE BUDGET
 EXAMINER, 28 APR., 1833, PP. 258-9

Though far from finished with French politics, Mill here reveals a
growing tendency to concentrate on English affairs, as he did for the
next five years, especially after the founding of the London Review in
1835. The details Mill mentions were given by Lord Althorp in
introducing the budget on 19 Apr. (PD, 3rd ser., Vol. 17, cols. 326-39).
This leading article in the “Political Examiner” is headed as title. It
is described in Mill’s bibliography as “An article headed ‘The Budget’
in the Examiner, of 28th April 1833” (MacMinn, p. 26). In the Somerville
College set of the Examiner, it is listed as title and enclosed in
square brackets (excluding the footnote), with two corrections: at
564.32 Edition: current; Page: [564] “that when” is altered to “that the
time when”, and at 565.6 “wisdom as” is altered to “wisdom and”.

the position of a minister who is able to propose taking off taxes, is a
most favourable one: it is hardly possible for him to avoid being
popular; whatever he proposes is sure to pass, and to pass with
extraordinary facility.

Commutation of taxes is quite another thing; often fully as important as
abolition, but always excessively difficult to accomplish.

As much harm may be done by raising the necessary amount of revenue in a
bad way, as even by raising an extravagant amount. For instance, the
taxes on paper, on pamphlets, on foreign books,1 and on newspapers,
impede the diffusion of knowledge;2 the tax on soap operates against
cleanliness; the taxes on insurance are direct discouragements to
prudence; the auction-duty is, in most cases, a tax on distress;3 the
malt tax4 and the excise, in all its branches, necessitates vexatious
regulations, which render production troublesome and expensive, and
prevent the introduction of improved processes, thereby taking far more
out of the pockets of the people than the amount of the revenue afforded
to Government. Many other taxes are objectionable on account of the
great expenses of their collection. We speak not at present of those
which are unequally assessed; bearing hard upon the poor or the middle
classes, and lightly on the rich; such as almost all the stamp duties,
and the house and window taxes.

Now, let a tax be bad to any excess, if, in taking it off, it be
necessary to impose a new one, the measure is almost sure to be
unpopular: there is far greater clamour from the newly-taxed than
gratitude from the newly-relieved. The latter personage has usually been
proclaiming his grievance to the four corners of the world for years
before, and he considers its removal as a tardy act of justice, wrung
from the Minister by importunity, obtained only because it could no
longer be refused, and for which he makes quite a sufficient return of
thankfulness if he cease complaining. The party, on the contrary, upon
whom the new tax is imposed, resents it as a wrong of the deepest dye;
resents the unexpected addition to his burthens, and resents, above all,
that he should be called upon to pay more to the State in order that
another may pay less.

What follows? This, surely; that the time when there is a surplus
revenue, when taxes are to be absolutely remitted, not merely commuted,
is an opportunity which should be eagerly seized for weeding out the
worst taxes, and getting rid of them for ever. That is the way to
retrench to most advantage. The nation saves the tax, and it saves two
or three times the tax in the moral or Edition: current; Page: [565]
economical ills which were produced by the particular taxes she is
enabled to extirpate. When you can reduce taxation itself, then is the
time to get rid of bad modes of taxation; by which, still more than by
the mere amount, taxation is injurious.

Have the Ministers thought of this? Not the least; equally deficient in
worldly wisdom and in any higher kind, they have positively accomplished
the marvel of remitting a million of taxes without gaining one particle
of credit from anybody. They might have so managed their remissions that
the country would save far more than the revenue would lose; they have
so managed them that the country will not save one farthing more, if
even so much. Except the trifling duty on tiles,5 they have not
abolished a single tax. They have pared off a little from one and a
little from another; leaving the expenses of collection undiminished,
and removing none of the collateral evils even of the taxes which are
lowered. Does any one suppose, for instance, that a slight diminution of
that most immoral tax—on marine assurances, will be of any avail while
the greater part remains? The reduction of the duty on soap is partially
an exception to this part of our censure, if, as Lord Althorp affirms,
it will put a stop to the illicit manufacture; but this is still a
problem. There is probably no one individual in the community who will
feel in this reduction of taxes any sensible relief; who will be
conscious of having five shillings in his pocket which he would not
otherwise have had:—we mistake; we ought to except Mr. Warren, Messrs.
Goss and Co.,6 and other frequent advertisers, who will grow rich upon
even so small a reduction of the advertisement duty, especially if the
plan be persevered in of making the reduction greater in proportion to
the repetition of the same advertisement.7 The landlords, too, of the
London shopkeepers may have reason to be thankful to Lord Althorp for an
increase of their rents, if, as is by no means improbable, that portion
of the house and window taxes which is to be remitted in favour of their
tenants, will go into their already well-filled pockets.

A reduction, less called for than that of the extra tax on the
importation of raw cotton, scarcely could have been found.8 Some
nonsense was talked by Mr. Baring and others about the advantage of this
remission to our export trade;9 but, surely, in cottons, if in any
thing, we have little to fear from foreign rivalry; and besides, the
duty might be (we believe it already is) drawn back on exportation.

Edition: current; Page: [566]
With the amount of remission which the Ministers had decided upon, they
might have entirely abolished the stamp duty on newspapers, the taxes on
fire and marine insurances, on pamphlets and foreign books, the auction
duty, and perhaps the duty on soap. By equalizing the duties on foreign
and colonial timber, which with their present large majority* they could
surely accomplish, though a Tory manoeuvre defeated their former attempt
to approximate to such an equalization,10 they might have raised, as has
been shown again and again, an additional million on timber without any
increase of burthen, and with that they might have dispensed with the
tax on paper and the tax on bricks11 or glass. By equalizing the house
tax and fairly assessing the houses of the rich, they might have got rid
of the window tax entirely. By equalizing the stamp duties they might
have raised as large a revenue as at present with less pressure on the
middle classes.


203.: CONFISCATION SCHEME OF THE TIMES
 EXAMINER, 5 MAY, 1833, P. 275

For Mill’s earlier comments on property taxes, see Nos. 195 and 196.
This article, responding to and quoting one in The Times, 2 May, p. 2,
in response to the budget (see No. 202), is in the “Political Examiner,”
headed as title. It is described in Mill’s bibliography as “An article
headed ‘Confiscation Scheme of the Times’ in the Examiner of 5th May
1833” (MacMinn, p. 26). In the Somerville College set of the Examiner,
it is listed as title and enclosed in square brackets (including the
note).

the times is at the head of that class of brawlers for a property tax,
who mean by it a tax on other people’s property, exempting their own.

The Times has resisted all former projects of confiscation; but it is
now identifying itself with perhaps the most audaciously unjust scheme
of confiscation yet broached: a “property tax” to be levied on
landholders and public and private creditors exclusively, and falling,
as may easily be shown, upon the present landholders and the present
fundholders, to the exclusion even of future ones.

But we shall allow this scheme of iniquity to speak for itself.

The object which, in common with a large body of the public, we had most
at heart on this late occasion, was, that Ministers themselves, in
accordance with the spirit manifested throughout the great towns, the
capital, and the country, should have seized the tide at flood, and
proposed, not resisted, the abrogation of the obnoxious imposts,
Edition: current; Page: [567] replacing them by a “property” tax. Now,
with respect to this latter expedient of finance, as it has given rise
to much controversy, and will be contested, we presume, during, at
least, the present Session of Parliament, it seems to us most desirable
to employ no terms in the designation of the tax that can be turned to
the sinister end of raising artificial difficulties in the shape of
causeless terror, or repugnance, or creating ambiguities susceptible of
what determination artful partizans may by and by be pleased to give
them, and thus unfairly disposing the minds of men to look at this
great, equitable, and efficient measure as one fraught with oppression
and iniquity. In one sense, and one only, a “property tax” and an
“income tax” is the same thing, namely, a tax upon the income derived
from every species of fixed and realized property. The question has been
put forth in recent publications, as if a Property Tax must mean of
necessity a tax upon landed and monied capital, however employed or
circumstanced. This is not what we have ever deemed to be a true
description of the tax, or an honest one, of such a tax as, in this
commercial country, would ever be endured. To tax, generally, the
capital engaged in active commerce, would be to fetter industry in all
its branches, and to impede the progress of the merchant’s or
manufacturer’s profits on their way to investment in some shape or
other, under which they might be fairly made available to a tax on
property. By a Property Tax, that Property Tax which, with all the
casual inequalities inseparable from it, though we believe they have
been much exaggerated, that the public may be discouraged from demanding
it, with all these we have, nevertheless, more than once recommended, by
that tax, our intention is, a per centage tax on revenue drawn from
legally ascertained and secured property, whether land, buildings, or
money at interest in the funds, on bond, or mortgage, in perpetuity, for
a definite term, or for life. This is at once an “Income Tax,” and a
“Property Tax.” But it is not a tax on profits, precarious or
conjectural. It waits until the profits, whether professional or
commercial, shall have been converted by investment into capital, to
which they have a general tendency, as all streams have to the ocean.
Nine-tenths of the outcry which was raised against the old Income Tax
was because of its warfare upon the operations of commercial industry,
and for what? For the sake of less than one-sixth of the produce of the
tax.

(The Times of Thursday last.)

The “equitable adjustment,”1 while vindicated on the ground of the
pretended change in the value of the currency, was honesty itself
compared with this. The shallow attempt at fraud which lies in the words
“fixed and realized property” is hardly worth the trouble of exposure. A
has twenty thousand pounds with which he sets up a manufactory. B has
other twenty thousand pounds which he has lent to A: B is to be taxed
and A is to go free. Why, in Heaven’s name? for what useful, for what
honest end? Say, if you will, that the amount of A’s property cannot be
correctly estimated, or that the attempt to estimate it would be
inquisitorial; (we believe that is the phrase;) these may be good
reasons against laying the tax upon A; but they can be no reasons for
leaving him and fastening upon B. If you will not endure to be taxed
yourselves, gentlemen of the Times, that does not entitle you to tax
other people who may not be so well able to evade the tax. This
pretension of capital engaged in business, to be exempt from taxation
because it may be taxed when it is withdrawn from business, is a
Edition: current; Page: [568] pretension almost worthy of the pampered
selfishness of a hereditary Legislature. A tax is to be laid on the man
who has saved, in order not to “impede the progress” of the man who is
saving; the man who does not save remaining untaxed. The tax is not to
fall on “profits,” it is to wait until the profits are “converted by
investment into capital;” capital belonging to a farmer, a manufacturer,
a merchant, or a tradesman, not being, it seems, capital at all. By your
good leave, gentlemen of the Times, the people of Great Britain will not
allow those four denominations of persons to withdraw their necks from
the burthen of taxation, throwing their portion of the public expenses
upon other people. Depend upon it, whatever may be the case with the
poor, the rich, at least, in the times that are coming, will be obliged
to share and share alike. By their stupidity and rapacity they may
succeed in weakening the security of all property; but let them rely
upon this, that they will not be permitted to make scape-goats of any
particular class of its possessors.

The proposers of this precious scheme cannot but be aware that being
partial taxation, it is confiscation; but they probably are not aware
that it would be a robbery of the present landholders and fundholders
exclusively. If a tax of ten per cent. were laid upon the income from
land and the funds, the price of both would, of course, fall ten per
cent. immediately, and future purchasers coming in at the reduced price,
would have an equivalent for the extra tax, they would bear no greater
burthen than they did before. The measure, therefore, would amount
simply to a seizure of one tenth of the land from the present
landholders, and a cutting off one tenth of the funds from the present
fundholders. It would be one of the most naked acts of spoliation
recorded in history.*


204.: FRENCH NEWS [78]
 EXAMINER, 5 MAY, 1833, PP. 281-2

Referring back to his similar accounts in May 1832 (see Nos. 162 and
172), Mill here summarizes with even more distaste the French
legislative session, which had begun on 17 Nov., 1832, and ended on 25
Apr., 1833. The article is headed “London, May 5, 1833.” The entry in
his bibliography covers this and No. 205: “The summary of French affairs
in the Examiner of 5th and 19th May 1833” (MacMinn, p. 26). In the
Somerville College set of the Examiner, this article is listed as
“Article on France” and enclosed in square brackets, with seven
corrections: at 569.4 “the year’s” is altered to “the last year’s”; at
569. 19 the comma after “colonies” is changed to a semi-colon; at 569.37
Edition: current; Page: [569] “which” becomes “who”; at 570.4 a comma is
added after “qualification”; at 570.11 “abide” becomes “abides”; at
570.29 the comma after “budget” is changed to a colon; and at 571.24
“this an” becomes “this once an”.

at the close of the last year’s Session of the French Chambers, we made
an inventory of the important measures of legislative improvement which
had been submitted to the consideration of those Assemblies during the
Session, and contrasting the great quantity of business laid before
them, with the little which they had got through, we concluded that the
use of a Chamber of Deputies as at present constituted in France, is not
to make laws but to prevent them from being made. If we thought this
last year, what are we to think now? Compared with the Session which has
just closed, that of the preceding year was a prodigy of activity and
usefulness. The measures of legislative improvement either real or
pretended, which have been passed into laws this Session are exactly
three. One of these abolishes the bounties on the re-exportation of
French colonial sugar, substituting a drawback equal to the duty on
importation, a slight approximation towards the principle of free trade,
with which the interests of the public treasury happened in this
instance fortunately to coincide.1 A short Act, in two short sentences,
removed the political disabilities of free men of colour in the French
colonies; and a third law gave to the slave-masters of those colonies
the benefit of local representative assemblies, a privilege from which
the slaves, who form the bulk of the population, will doubtless derive
as great advantages and of the same kind as ours do in Jamaica.2

Two other Bills of far greater importance underwent a long and laborious
discussion in the Chamber of Deputies, but the Session has terminated
before either of them had even come on for consideration in the Chamber
of Peers. One of these was a Bill for facilitating pecuniary
arrangements with the owners of land required for public works, as
roads, canals, and the like:3 a subject of great importance in France,
where the multitude of small landed proprietors, their exorbitant claims
of compensation, and the great delay and expense necessitated by the
legal forms which must be gone through for compelling them to submit to
a fair valuation, are obstacles to the improvement of the internal
resources of France, often equivalent to an entire prohibition. The
other Bill to which we allude, was one which public opinion has been
demanding for the last fifteen years more urgently than any other single
measure, the very question which turned out the Martignac Ministry. Its
object was to render the departmental councils, who vote the local taxes
and regulate the local affairs of the Departments (and who are now
nominated by the Crown) elective bodies, Edition: current; Page: [570]
appointed by the suffrages of at least some portion of the people.4 This
portion, in the Bill as presented by Ministers, was not to exceed
150,000 electors, out of a population of 33,000,000 of souls. The
Chamber of Deputies, in this instance more liberal than the King and his
Ministers, lowered the qualification, and increased the number of
electors to about 300,000.5 Even this electoral body was, one might
think, rather circumscribed. But so displeasing to the “powers that be”
was even this slight symptom of a democratic spirit, that after the
Bill, as amended, had passed the Chamber of Deputies, Ministers delayed
introducing it into the Chamber of Peers for a whole month, with the
premeditated design of not leaving time for it to pass. By the close of
the Session the Bill is lost, and the arbitrary nomination of these
taxing and legislating bodies abides with Louis Philippe for at least
another year.

What then has the Session produced? Produced! It has produced money. Its
results are the vote of an enormous budget,6 and an endless series of
extraordinary votes of credit.7 Meantime the French nation is falling
deeper and deeper into difficulties. The revenue falls short of the
expenditure by a large annual deficit, which is annually supplied partly
by new loans, partly by the sale of what still remains of the forests
belonging to the State. The national debt has, we believe, doubled since
the fall of Napoleon, and augments largely every year. Meantime the
mockery of a sinking fund is kept up;8 between three and four millions
sterling of new debt are annually contracted for the redemption of old;
and this process of transfer from the right pocket to the left, dropping
a part by the way, is still vaunted by French financiers as the acme of
financial knowledge and skill. M. Laffitte, long the main support of
this ridiculous and exploded juggle, with the candour which
distinguishes him, publicly renounced his error in a speech delivered in
the late Session.9

Immediately after the prorogation, the Chambers were called together for
a fresh Session.10 The sole object of this second convocation is more
money: another year’s budget: and when that is obtained, as it will be
(judging from Edition: current; Page: [571] experience) very promptly
and easily, the Deputies will be dismissed.11 An alteration in the
réglement, or standing orders of the Chamber of Deputies, fortunately
enables the business which was commenced in one Session, to be taken up
in the next at the point where it left off;12 and since many of the
Bills introduced in the late Session and referred to select Committees,
had been returned from these Committees before the prorogation and are
ready for immediate discussion, it is to be hoped that the interval
which must elapse before the budget of 1834 can have passed through the
same preliminary stage, will be employed in passing some of those
important Bills. The Chamber has now at length begun to deliberate on
the Bill for establishing an elementary school in every parish.13 Let it
but adopt this, and it will have done more for the substantial interests
of France and mankind, than any French Legislature since the Bourbons
were restored.

One solitary iota of commendation is due to the conduct of the Chambers
during the Session which is just ended: they did not pass the Bill which
the Ministers introduced for establishing an Irish Coercion system
throughout France.14 This praise belongs to the Chamber of Peers; who
are a conservative body in the genuine sense, determined neither to
allow of new good nor new evil. The Chamber of Deputies had not the
opportunity offered them of either adopting or throwing out this Bill,
but they seem to have been desirous of leaving no doubt which of the two
they would have done if the option had been given; so at least we judge
from their conduct to the responsible editor of the Tribune newspaper.
They summoned him before them to be tried for a libel upon themselves,
(he had called them une chambre prostituée,) and having for this once an
opportunity of being judges in their own cause, availed themselves of it
to wreak upon poor M. Lionne, by the severest sentence consistent with
the law, the accumulated vengeance due to the repeated refusals of Paris
juries to assist by their verdicts in putting down the liberty of the
press.15

205.: FRENCH NEWS [79]
 EXAMINER, 19 MAY, 1833, P. 313

For the context and entry in Mill’s bibliography, see No. 204. The item,
headed “London, May 19, 1833,” is listed as “Article on France” and
enclosed in square brackets in the Somerville College set of the
Examiner.

the education bill has passed the Chamber of Deputies, and will probably
pass into a law this Session.1 It will establish one or more elementary
schools in every commune; (township or village;) a school of a somewhat
higher order in every town containing 6000 inhabitants; and a number of
normal schools for the education of schoolmasters to teach in those
local institutions. The plan is an imitation of some parts of the
admirable arrangements of the Prussian Government for the education of
its subjects.2 Once introduced, it can scarcely be so ill-managed as not
to be a most substantial benefit to France.

The Chamber is now winding its way through a long and intricate Bill for
more precisely determining the powers and duties of the municipal or
communal assemblies,3 which, by virtue of a law passed two years ago,4
are chosen by something approaching to popular election. If the Chamber
of Deputies and the Departmental assemblies were chosen by as large a
body of electors as the councils for managing the local affairs of the
commune, France would have little to complain of in regard to the
substantial reality of her representative government.

After these two laws come the money bills; and with them the Session of
1833 will close. The Budget now about to be discussed differs from that
recently voted in this, that it professes to propose no new loans.5 It
takes 20,000,000 of francs (800,000l.) from the sinking fund, by
cancelling redeemed stock to that amount. It takes two or three millions
more (millions of francs) from the same source, for the purpose of
public works, by bringing a further portion of redeemed stock again into
the market; which, though not called a new loan, is really such, but to
no very large amount. It is proposed to raise 20,000,000 (800,000l.)
more, by increased taxation on the already overburdened article of
Edition: current; Page: [573] wine.6 By these means, and by a small
reduction of the enormous army, the deficit is to be, as they phrase it,
comblé; filled up and made level.

The Duchess of Berri has simultaneously produced a daughter, and a
lawful husband in the person of a Neapolitan Count, named Hector de
Lucchesi-Palli.7 The poor Carlists find it best to deny the whole story.
It is all, they pretend, an imposture got up by the Government.


206.: BEOLCHI’S SAGGIO DI POESIE ITALIANE
 EXAMINER, 26 MAY, 1833, P. 326

Mill here calls attention to a fellow radical, Carlo Beolchi
(1796-1867), who was exiled for his part in the Piedmontese
revolutionary movement, and taught Italian in London. The review, in the
“Literary Examiner,” is headed “Saggio di Poesie Italiane, scelte da
Carlo Beolchi, LL.D. Con notizie interno alla vita ed alle opere degli
autori. Rolandi, Berners-street. [1833.]” This is the 2nd ed.; the 1st
ed. (London: Rolandi, 1825) was entitled Saggio della poesia italiana.
It is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A short notice of a selection
of Italian Poetry by Signor Beolchi, in the Examiner of 26th May 1833”
(MacMinn, p. 26). In the Somerville College set of the Examiner, it is
listed as “Notice of Beolchi’s Saggio di Poesie Italiane” and enclosed
in square brackets, with one correction: in the heading “auiori” is
corrected to “autori”.

this little selection of Italian poetry deserves to be recommended for
this reason—that Mr. Beolchi has not, as such compilers generally do,
contented himself with reprinting poems and passages of poems, which
every one is familiar with, but has chosen for himself; selecting in
preference the less known and less hacknied productions of the various
writers. He has also included in his choice, specimens of the best
Italian poets of the present age, some of whom are not unworthy of the
better times of their country: Manzoni, Monti, Foscolo, Pindemonte,
Rossetti, and others.1

207.: THE MONTHLY REPOSITORY FOR JUNE 1833
 EXAMINER, 16 JUNE, 1833, PP. 372-3

The third of Mill’s favourable reviews of Fox’s journal (see Nos. 198
and 200) contains interesting material relating to his theory of poetry.
Mill had nothing in this number of the Monthly Repository, but his
“Alison’s History” appeared in two parts in the numbers for July and
August. The review, which appeared in the “Literary Examiner,” is headed
“The Monthly Repository for June [n.s. VII]. (Edited by W.J. Fox.)”; the
page references are to this volume. The article is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “A notice of the Monthly Repository for June 1833, in
the Examiner of 16th June 1833” (MacMinn, p. 32). In the Somerville
College set of the Examiner, it is listed as “Review of the Monthly
Repository for June” and enclosed in square brackets, with one
correction: at 574.28 “as” is deleted in “occasions; as it”.

an excellent number of an excellent work. Each article deserves a
separate commendation, for each has its own merit and its own interest;
and there is more than usual variety both in the subjects and in the
treatment of them. The article which contains most wisdom, as well as
beauty, is ostensibly a description of scenery, under the quaint title
of Local Logic;1 and it indeed proves many things; but chiefly, what
perhaps the writer least thought of, that the highest beauty is not that
which is received from the object, but that which is given to it by the
perceiving mind: that—(as Pope says)—

-   

    —the difference is as great between
-   

    The optics seeing as the objects seen.2

It is the poetry of description and the philosophy both in one; because
the description is only the outward part, the inward is the feelings and
the thoughts of a highly sensitive and reflecting mind. These feelings
and thoughts are the soul, the scenery described is the body, which
gives impressions to the soul but receives them back tenfold. The wisdom
is not in sentences and maxims equally fit for all occasions; it admits
not of being extracted; it pervades the whole, and shines through from
beneath the surface, but no more admits of being detached from its
external vesture, than the flesh from the skin.

Among the other articles we would notice particularly a paper on Miss
Martineau’s tale of The Parish, in which the writer takes up the cause
of that lady against her reviewer in the Edinburgh Review.3 We have
seldom read any article more characteristic of Whiggery, of the
Edinburgh Review itself, and of the Edition: current; Page: [575]
juste-milieu respectability spirit in general, than that same Whig
article on Miss Martineau. With some just and some unjust criticism on
the details of her various performances, the aim and purport of the
article on the whole was to intimate to Miss Martineau, in as many and
as various forms of words as the writer could, that she was and should
be reputed a very clever, meritorious, indeed extraordinary person,
provided always she would submit all her opinions to the previous ordeal
of Whig wisdom; that it is a very fine thing in a woman to write, and
write with earnestness, on politics and morals, so long as all she
writes in politics is strictly Whig, and in morals strictly
common-place, but vastly shocking if she writes anything else. Every
approach to free, vigorous, far-reaching thought which we recollect to
have seen in Miss Martineau’s Illustrations, her Edinburgh reviewer,
with scarcely an exception, singles out for special animadversion; and
reads a succession of solemn, prosing, good-natured lectures to one who
is at least as well-qualified to lecture him; and who in the long run
will be by many degrees the more successful lecturer, for the time is no
more when the ballast of society was too ponderous for its quantity of
sail.

Our friend “Junius Redivivus” has two able papers in this number,4 and
the Autobiography of Pel. Verjuice is full of mournful truths on
education and society as they now are;5 and as such writers as the
Edinburgh reviewer would for ever keep them, not from evil intention,
but from a most plentiful lack of intellectual audacity and
comprehension of mind.


208.: THE BANK CHARTER BILL [1]
 EXAMINER, 30 JUNE, 1833, P. 409

This is one of three items on the renewal of the Bank of England’s
Charter (see also Nos. 209 and 212). The Bank had been established in
1694 (5 & 6 William and Mary, c. 20); its most recent Charter, that of
39 & 40 George III, c. 28 (1800), was due to expire on 1 Aug., 1833. The
Bank’s original monopoly had been curtailed by the allowing of Edition:
current; Page: [576] joint-stock banks (i.e., banks with more than six
partners) of deposit and issue, located farther than sixty-five miles
from London, by 7 George IV, c. 46 (1826); the main question now was
whether the Bank’s partial monopoly was to be prolonged. Mill here
refers to the “Resolutions proposed by Lord Viscount Althorp, in the
Committee on the Bank Charter” (31 May, 1833), PP, 1833, XXIII, 299-300,
and to Althorp’s outline of the ministry’s further plans. The debate, in
which Colonel Torrens moved that consideration of renewal be postponed
until the next session, began on 28 June, and continued on 1 and 3 July
(PD, 3rd ser., Vol. 18, cols. 1306-53, 1361-1408, and Vol. 19, cols.
82-110). The brief unheaded note is described in Mill’s bibliography as
“A paragraph on the Bank Charter Bill, in the Examiner of 30th June
1833” (MacMinn, p. 32). In the Somerville College set of the Examiner,
it is listed as “Paragraph on the Bank Question” and enclosed in square
brackets.

the scheme of the ministers with respect to the renewal of the Bank
Charter is full of crudities, and rests on no rational basis of
principle.1 As there is nothing in the nature of the question which
presses for a speedy decision, it would be wise in Ministers to pass a
temporary Act for continuing the existing system one year longer, and
employ part of that time in a reconsideration of the subject, with the
advantage of the discussions which their plan now, when promulgated,
cannot fail to engender.—We shall return to this topic next week.


209.: THE MINISTERIAL MEASURE RESPECTING THE BANK
 EXAMINER, 7 JULY, 1833, PP. 417-18

Mill here redeems the promise in No. 208 (q.v.), though he seems not to
have been proud of his performance, for he wrote to his friend J.P.
Nichol on 10 July that “the article was superficial, and could not
consistently with its purpose be otherwise” (EL, CW, Vol. XII, p. 167).
He is commenting on the “Bill for Giving to the Corporation of the
Governor and Company of the Bank of England Certain Privileges, for a
Limited Period, under Certain Conditions,” 4 William IV (5 July, 1833),
PP, 1833, I, 69-76, eventually enacted as 3 & 4 William IV, c. 98; it
had received first reading on 5 July. The leader, which appeared in the
“Political Examiner,” headed as title, is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “An article headed ‘The Ministerial Measure respecting
the Bank’ in the Examiner of 7th July 1833” (MacMinn, p. 32). In the
Somerville College set of the Examiner, it is listed as title and
enclosed in square brackets, with three emendations: at 577.31
“opinions” is altered to “opinion”; at 582.7 “lest” is changed to
“last”; and at 582.10 “fact” is changed to “part”. The second of these
is clearly an inaccurate correction, and we have given “least” as what
the sense requires.

the proposed measure for the renewal of the Bank Charter is a specimen
of the sort of legislation to be expected from the sort of men by whom,
for want of Edition: current; Page: [577] better, the instrument of
Government is likely for some time longer to be wielded. In one respect,
the reputation of Ministers ought to benefit by it. Those who have been
accustomed to see in the timid, vacillating, and truckling policy of the
present Administration, evidence of intentions hostile to the interests
of the community, may incline to a more charitable judgment on seeing
them exhibit, even on a question like this, where their greatest enemies
cannot suspect them of any undue bias in point of interest, exactly the
same kind of mental incapacity; no power of grasping any principle; no
attempt to ground their proceedings upon any comprehensive, even though
false, views; no appearance of understanding the subject, or even of
thinking they understand it; nothing contemplated which rises to the
dignity of even a half-measure—only quarter and half-quarter measures; a
little scratching on the surface of one or two existing evils, but no
courage to attempt their excision, because there has been no vigour or
skill to probe them to the bottom. It is only in points of comparative
detail that even the tendency is towards improvement; the general system
of our currency, so far as altered at all, is to be altered for the
worse; the exclusive privileges of the Bank of England are to be even
extended.

From the tenor of the evidence delivered before the Parliamentary
Committee of last Session,1 joined to the fact that the Committee was
not reappointed to hear the other side of the question this year, it was
probable that Ministers had made up their minds, (as far as minds like
theirs are ever made up,) to maintain the Bank monopoly unimpaired, at
least in the leading point of being the sole bank of issue in the
metropolis. They appear to have been wholly governed by the authority of
the London bankers, who had the natural prejudice of practical men in
favour of the system under which they had thriven, and against changes
which would raise up powerful rivals to themselves. Even able and honest
men are apt to confide too exclusively in the modes of transacting
business with which they are familiar, and the securities on which they
have been accustomed safely to rely; they do not learn all at once to
have equal trust in other though perfectly effectual securities, nor
even in the same securities when the circumstances are apparently
different. The opinion of the London bankers in favour of the Bank
monopoly does not appear to us to be the result of argument. If they had
given no reasons whatever it might have been supposed they had excellent
ones to give; but since they have given reasons, if those reasons are
mere assumptions, it must be supposed that they had a predisposition,
(though, we are convinced, in the case of some of them, a perfectly
unconscious one,) in favour of the conclusion they have arrived at; and
that the merit of their argument, like that of a jest, lies “in the
favour of him that receives it.”2

The principal reason assigned, the only one upon which any stress is
laid, is Edition: current; Page: [578] the danger of competition. If
banking was free, and bankers striving against each other to put forth
their notes, there would be over-issue. But why? Tell us why? In all
other branches of business competition is the great preventive and
corrector of excess: the greater the competition the more accurately is
the supply proportioned to the demand. If the markets of London were
supplied with provisions by one single dealer, or one single company of
dealers, there would be frequent over-supply and frequent deficiency.
Every blunder, every miscalculation of a single individual would inflict
upon the town one of these evils or the other. If there were two
dealers, or three, and no more, they might all chance to miscalculate
the same way. But there is so great a number, that their mistakes
neutralize one another, and the markets are consequently supplied with a
regularity and an equality, which the foresight of the ablest man, or
body of men, could not make the most distant approach to; accident seems
to have lost its powers over this portion of human affairs; there is no
fluctuation, except where there is rational cause for it.

We have never heard any argument to show that the currency of London
could not safely be supplied by private bankers, which would not also
show that the food of London cannot safely be supplied by private
dealers. If London had always hitherto, like a town in expectation of a
siege, been victualled by the Government, what a clamour would be raised
when the first proposal was made of trusting to private interest for the
supply! Every man of routine would prophesy the utter failure of the
plan; would predict that the metropolis would one day be left without
food, that another day food would be brought to market in such
quantities that it would spoil before it could find a purchaser; the
subsistence of a million and a half of people would be declared too vast
a concern to be managed by private hands, too all-important to be risked
upon the faith of theories. These fears, anterior to experience, would
not have been altogether so absurd as they seem: but with this
experience, trusting with the steadiest confidence to competition for
our food, it is strange we should think ourselves unable to trust to it
for our circulating medium.

But let us grapple with this question somewhat more closely. It would be
the interest of private bankers to put forth a super-abundance of paper
and depreciate the currency. What then? Such is also the interest of the
Bank of England. In order to make it not the interest of the Bank of
England, that body is required to pay its notes in gold, in order that
when they become depreciated, they may be brought back to the Bank, and
gold demanded in exchange. This security is either sufficient or it is
not:—if not, we are liable to depreciation from the Bank of England; if
it be sufficient, the same obligation to give gold for their notes will
operate with the same efficacy as a restraint upon private bankers.

It is supposed that if competition were allowed, every bank would strive
to fill the entire circulation with its own notes: that each would
attempt to put forth as much paper as if itself were the sole bank of
issue; hoping that while itself Edition: current; Page: [579] derived
all the profit, its rivals would bear a share of the subsequent loss, as
the run for gold, occasioned by depreciation, would probably affect all
the banks, not that alone whose over-issues had occasioned it. We state
the argument as strongly as it can be stated; much more strongly than it
is commonly put by those whom we are supposing to be influenced by it.

Our answer is, that after the first rush consequent on the removal of
the restriction was over, and the supply of the circulation had divided
itself among the various banks according to the extent of their
connexions, and of the credit reposed in them, they would be very
cautious of extending their issues unless to fill up a gap in the
circulation produced by the discrediting of a rival bank, or unless the
state of the money transactions of the country was such as admitted of
an increase of the currency without depreciating it. If one of the banks
commenced an imprudent extension of its issues, the other banks would be
immediately warned of the fact by the increased number of its notes
which would come into their possession in the course of trade; and they
would immediately return those notes on the hands of the issuers in
exchange for gold. Indeed this would be done, even without any express
design on their part, the very first day, by the ordinary operations of
the clearing-house. It is well known that the London bankers every
afternoon pay over to each other the cheques drawn upon any one of them
which have been paid into any other house during the day, and receive or
pay the differences. If they were banks of issue they would at the same
time, and in the same manner, interchange their notes as well as
cheques. Consequently if any one bank had increased its issues while
others had not, more of its notes would be returned to it at the
clearing-house, than would be balanced by the notes of other banks paid
into itself, and it would be called upon to pay the difference in cash
that very day. The check would, therefore, operate instantaneously.

This is not only a necessary conclusion from the theory of the subject,
but is borne out by specific experience. The Scotch banks, which, as
every one knows, are the most stable banking establishments in the
world, actually do exchange their notes in this precise manner; and the
consequence is that there is nothing like the dreaded struggle of rival
banks to supplant one another, but each rests satisfied with the share
of the circulation which custom has assigned to it. The system, however,
altogether prevents the existence of any bank of doubtful credit. No
such bank exists, or has existed, except in one or two instances and for
very short periods, in all Scotland for the last hundred years.

The arguments, therefore, of the supporters of the Bank monopoly are
equally in contradiction to the reason of the case and to the most
obvious and particular experience on the very point.

An exclusive privilege of issuing paper-money, given to such an
establishment as the Bank of England, is altogether an anomaly. Either
the regulation of the currency may safely be left, under the security of
convertibility, to the private Edition: current; Page: [580] interest of
the issuers, or, if not, it is part of the business of Government, and
should be under the control of a responsible Minister. The common notion
seems to be, that if the issuers look only to their own interest they
will best consult that by over-issue; and that it is necessary the
currency should be every now and then tampered with on some principle of
public policy. But if this were true, there could not be a more unfit
body to be entrusted with absolute power of regulating the currency,
than a private irresponsible company. We must have the security of
private interest or the security of responsibility, one or the other; if
we cannot trust to the former, we must be fools to let ourselves be
jockeyed out of the latter. If issuing paper-money must be a public
trust, it should be vested in a public functionary, who ought to be
liable to displacement if he prove incompetent, to punishment if he
neglect or violate the duties of his office.

Our own opinion is, that the interest of the issuers of notes when
obliged to pay them in gold on demand, is identical with the interest of
the public, and that by taking their measures prudently for their own
interest, they are providing effectually against over-issue and all
other dangers. We would, therefore have banking free. It is desirable,
certainly, to secure to the public the largest possible share of the
profits arising from the substitution of the cheaper for the more costly
medium of exchange. This, however, might be accomplished, as it is to a
certain extent even at present, by a stamp duty on bank notes.3 This
duty we would raise as high as it would bear. We would then remove all
restrictions on the establishment of banking partnerships, and would
even allow the formation of joint-stock banking companies with limited
responsibility, provided a certain large amount of capital was first
paid up. With the example of Scotland before us, we can feel no doubt
that the formation of safe banks would drive all unsafe ones out of the
field, and that the failure of a bank would soon become as unheard of an
event on this as it is on the other side of the Tweed: ultimately,
therefore, the issue even of one pound notes might, as in Scotland, take
place without any danger; but in the mean time we would even, if
necessary, prohibit all notes below ten pounds, in order to confine the
circulation of paper to those classes who may be trusted to judge for
themselves of the solvency of a bank.

With this proviso we should have no apprehension of the effects of
allowing the issues of paper money to be as free as that of bills of
exchange. We should as soon dream of giving to one establishment a
monopoly of the latter kind of security as of the former.*

Edition: current; Page: [581]
The tendency of the Ministerial measure is “clean contrary.” The Bank of
England is not only to remain the only bank of issue in London, but the
wish of Government is that it should progressively become the issuer of
paper for the whole country. With this view it is proposed to permit the
formation of joint-stock banking companies, with limited responsibility,
on condition that these companies shall not issue paper of their own,
but transact all their business with the notes of the Bank of England.
As these banks would probably, by the greater confidence of the public
in their solvency, drive all or most of the present country bankers out
of the field, Bank of England paper would wholly or in great measure
supersede all the existing country paper. What advantage Lord Althorp
anticipated from this substitution his Lordship omitted to inform us;
but it is easy to see one obvious and inevitable disadvantage—a great
increase of forgery. A country note never circulates beyond the
neighbourhood of the issuers, and forged notes are presented for
payment, or come into the bankers’ hands as deposits so very speedily
that it is almost impossible to throw many of them into circulation
without beng detected. But if Bank of England notes were the common
circulating medium of Cumberland or Cornwall, the forger might continue
his operations for months before a forged note passed into the hands of
any one who could detect the forgery.

Lord Althorp has announced that for the present at least he will not
press that part of his plan on which we are now remarking.4 He has not
changed his opinion, but he candidly confesses that the country bankers
are too strong for him, and that he cannot carry it. Along with the evil
of this part of the project, we are therefore to be deprived of the
good. The principle of permitting the formation of joint-stock companies
for banking is for the present abandoned.

For the continuance of the Bank monopoly, so far as respects the issue
of notes, there was at least a colour, a semblance of reason; men who
had paid attention to the subject had advocated that side of the
question. But what excuse, what pretext is there for continuing the
exclusive privileges of the Bank of England as a bank of mere deposit?
Would it have been credible a few years ago that any Ministry would have
had the folly, or the boldness, to propose the renewal of the
prohibition on the formation of banks with more than six partners,
Edition: current; Page: [582] in London and 65 miles round it? Amidst so
much cant about making banks secure, here is a law for the express
purpose of making them insecure. Who that remembers Lord Liverpool’s
letter to the Bank in 1826,5 and the warning he gave them of the little
reason they had to expect any further prolongation of their monopoly
after the expiration of their present Charter, could have believed it
possible that a reforming Ministry, a Ministry the professed enemy of
monopolies, would have proposed the renewal of even the least atom of
the Bank monopoly, even that part of it for which no human being,
instructed or ignorant, has yet ventured to utter one word of defence?

The importance of that part of the Ministerial measure which permits the
country-bankers to pay their notes in Bank of England notes instead of
specie, appears to us to have been greatly exaggerated both by its
supporters and by its opponents. If the monopoly of the Bank is to be
continued, we should, perhaps, approve of this provision. Considered as
a further extension of the privileges of that body, we view it with
decided disapprobation.

But what shall we say of the grandest improvement of all, the publicity
of the Bank issues? When convertibility is secured, the greatest
additional security which can be given to the currency is to let in the
light upon all the accounts, and all the transactions of all banks of
issue without any exception or reserve; that the public may know
instantaneously when there is any danger of insolvency, or any danger of
an excessive circulation, and that the check of convertibility may
operate without a moment’s delay. This is the principle improvement
which our monetary system, so far as its security is concerned, now
admits of. And what do the Ministers propose? Publication once in three
months, of the amount of notes in circulation only; and not even of the
amount of notes circulating at the particular time, but of the average
amount for three months previous. To the Government, indeed, weekly
accounts are to be furnished; but the Government is the very party from
whose tampering with the Bank, most danger is to be apprehended; the
great over-issues of 1824 and 1825 were encouraged by the Government. As
for the country bankers, they also were to disclose the amount of their
issues to the Government, but the public were not to know even once in
three months the amount in circulation of the notes of each bank, but
only of all the country banks taken together. Even this has not been
persisted in. The affairs of country bankers are to remain in the dark.

Thus every party or class which has interests opposed to the public,
contrives to hold its own, and the public only are sacrificed. But that
is because parties and classes look after their own interests, and the
public neglect theirs.

There is only one other point which we shall notice. Doubtless any
relaxation Edition: current; Page: [583] of the mischievous and
contemptible Usury Laws,6 is a step towards good: but what sort of
figure do a Ministry exhibit to any rational person, when they propose
to the Legislature to declare that it shall be accounted right to borrow
money at more than five per cent. interest for three months, and wrong
for four; right, if the money is lent on a bill of exchange, and wrong
if it is lent on mortgage? The fact is, that the country gentlemen, in
their ineffable stupidity, do not choose to be allowed to borrow money
at six per cent.; they prefer, when they cannot do without it, to borrow
it by circuitous methods, at nine or ten per cent. contrary to law. The
Ministers, instead of shaming the country gentlemen out of their
ridiculous prejudices, give way to them, and dare not propose any
measure which those sages would not like to pass. They therefore
compromise the matter: instead of taking off the tight shoe, they make
an incision into it where it pinches hardest.


210.: FRENCH NEWS [80]
 EXAMINER, 21 JULY, 1833, P. 457

This item, headed “London, July 21, 1833,” is described in Mill’s

1833” (MacMinn, p. 33). In the Somerville College set of the Examiner,
the article is listed as “Article on France” and enclosed in square
brackets.

the french chambers have concluded the second of their two continuous
Sessions. The labours of the former of the two we passed in review some
time since, and found subject for marvel that two Assemblies could have
remained together for so many months and accomplished nothing.1 The
second has not been so totally unproductive. The salutary alteration in
the standing orders of the Chamber of Deputies, whereby they were
enabled to take up the unfinished business of one Session in the next,
at the stage in which it was left,2 has enabled the two Houses to pass
three of the important laws which were pending before them.

The first in importance of these is the long expected and long suspended
Education Bill.3 This is at length carried, and every parish in France
will now have an elementary school, every town of 6000 inhabitants a
school of a Edition: current; Page: [584] somewhat higher order. In its
passage through the Chamber of Peers this Bill has undergone part of the
usual deteriorating process. The local Committees who are to look after
the management of the schools, are to consist of three members, of whom
the curé is, ex-officio, to be one.

A Bill has passed for facilitating the arrangements with the owners of
land required for public works.4 The great number of small landed
proprietors in France, their exorbitant claims for compensation, and the
superstitious regard paid by the French law and the tribunals to all
proprietary rights, have hitherto opposed barriers almost insuperable to
the formation of canals, railways, and other works of public usefulness.
These obstructions will now be considerably diminished, and all
authorities agree in representing the Bill which has just passed as a
measure of substantial improvement.

The last of the three laws to which we allude is one which gives to the
people, or rather to an extremely limited class of the people, the
election of the departmental councils or administrative bodies for
voting and appropriating the taxes imposed for the local purposes of the
department.5 This law has undergone large mutilations to adapt it to the
Oligarchical spirit of the Chamber of Peers. The Deputies, though
themselves the representatives of a body of electors not amounting to
200,000, had, in spite of the Ministry, admitted a class not short of
400,000 to a voice in the election of these local bodies. But the Peers,
always ready to abet the executive in any opposition to the extension of
popular privileges, restricted the suffrage to a narrower body,
consisting of the 180,000, or thereabouts, who have votes in the
election of the Legislature, together with those who, by the exercise of
a liberal profession, are qualified to serve on juries.

Little, therefore, beyond the principle of popular election, has on this
occasion been gained; but even that is much.

The Deputies hurried through their second Budget with the most indecent
precipitation.6 In order to get through their business and leave Paris,
they consented to give up retrenchments which they had insisted upon in
the budgets of the two preceding years.7 The salaries of various public
officers, which were reduced two years ago, have been raised to their
former standard, at a time when the expenses of every year considerably
exceed the revenues!

211.: MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS
 EXAMINER, 11 AUG., 1833, PP. 497-8

Writing to Carlyle on 2 Aug., Mill remarks that he has recently not seen
much of Fonblanque and has contributed very little to the Examiner,
“almost the only paper” being one that will appear “in the next or”—as
it did—in “the next but one”. He continues: “I will let you find it out
if you can; there is not much in it; it is all political” (EL, CW, Vol.
XII, pp. 171-2). This deprecation must be somewhat discounted, for Mill
habitually played up Carlyle’s distaste for the merely political; in any
case, the reform and health of local institutions were important matters
for Mill throughout his career. The first leader in the “Political
Examiner,” headed as title, it is described in Mill’s bibliography as
“An article headed ‘Municipal Institutions’ in the Examiner of 11th
August 1833” (MacMinn, p. 33). In the Somerville College set of the
Examiner, it is listed as title and enclosed in square brackets.

a commission has been appointed, and, judging from some of the names in
the list, we anticipate that it will be an honest and efficient one, for
inquiring into the state of Municipal Corporations, and, of course, for
suggesting all possible amendments in the constitution and functions of
those bodies.1

These commissioners have now a noble opportunity of planting in the
public mind the germs of the most important improvements which remain to
be made in the machinery of government in this country. But to do this
they must take a liberal and expanded view of the subject of their
inquiries. They must not consider themselves limited to the paltry
office of devising means by which rude institutions, adapted to the
exigencies and the conceptions of rude ages, may be patched and cobbled
so as to hold together some years longer. The whole of our local
institutions must be revised; there is no soundness in them; for many
important purposes they do not exist at all; for no good purpose do they
make effectual provision, while they are the seats of the most pervading
and audacious political profligacy to be found in the kingdom.

It would certainly be an exaggeration to say that the character of the
local functionaries, and the conduct of local business, is more
important than the constitution and character of the general government;
for the latter includes the former: if the general government is bad,
the local administration will commonly be bad too; the only security for
the working of the subordinate parts of the machinery, is in the
construction of the great central wheel or lever which sets the rest in
motion. But it is little, if any, over-statement, to affirm, that the
excellence of the form of government is chiefly desirable as a means to
obtaining Edition: current; Page: [586] good local institutions. The
real business of government is, almost all of it, local business. All
the visible apparatus of a windmill or a watermill, is for nothing but
to bring two millstones together: some of the greatest steam-engines in
the world do nothing but send down buckets into a well. The machinery of
government is equally humble in its immediate ends. It is neither at the
head nor the heart, but at the extremities, that the ruling body touches
the ruled. With what magistrate of the state do the bulk of the citizens
come in contact? Who, as far as they are concerned, constitutes the
Government? The king? the prime minister? the lord chancellor? No; the
justice of the peace, the overseer, and the parish constable. Except in
order that these last may do their duty, it matters little to any but a
very few persons, what happens with regard to the others. Even the
Legislature, the power which controuls all, when it makes laws affecting
the most vital interests of the humblest citizen, does but issue orders
which those local functionaries are to execute. And it might as well
issue no orders, as issue them to persons who are incapable of executing
them properly. There are numbers of important laws which the legislature
cannot enact, because it knows that it has no persons to whom it can
trust for carrying them into effect. This is the great obstacle to many
of the most necessary amendments in the details of our institutions. One
only part of the business of government—the levying of taxes—the central
authority shows itself well able to accomplish without help from any
one: it takes care to have local officers fit for that, if for no other
purpose. But even that function it but divides with the authorities of
the county and of the parish. The taxes which are voted by local and
irresponsible bodies, probably exceed in amount those levied by
Parliament for the general purposes of government. And this is no more
than reasonable: for those local bodies really do us more service in
return for our money: what they do, they do unspeakably ill; but they do
the greater part of what is done. We often wonder what the nominal
Government does, or pretends to do, for all that it costs. The question
must be a puzzling one to foreigners, and to those who have lived in
foreign countries, where Governments do govern, where the public
business really is transacted by the persons who are paid for
transacting it.

In this country, the practice has always been that the Government shall
not govern. That was the practice, all over Europe, in the feudal times.
The king, by the custom of those times, only led the people to battle.
The king did not govern: so far as there was any government, the barons
governed; and the king, as one of those barons, governed his own domain.
As the king gradually absorbed the power of the barons into his own,
they were superseded in their function of governing: but scarcely any
substitutes were provided. The king supplied scarcely any organs of
government, except the officers whom he had originally employed to
govern his private domain, and those to whom he had been in the habit of
referring the petitions which were made to him complaining of the
conduct of the barons; in particular, his private secretary, his
cancellarius, Edition: current; Page: [587] seal-bearer or chancellor.
There were neither local courts of justice, nor local officers of
administration. The French talk of centralization; but where is the
centralization to be compared with ours, where, from one end of England
to the other, there is scarcely to be found a paid Government officer,
except a soldier or a tax-gatherer, anywhere but in London? It is true
that the public business is not transacted in London, because it cannot
be. It therefore is left to transact itself. Whatever could only be done
on the spot, or could not bear the delay and expense of a journey to
London, and yet could not be left undone, was turned over to amateurs.
The corporate towns retained the powers (which had been granted them as
an exemption from the jurisdiction of their enemies the barons) of
managing their own local affairs, and administering justice by their own
officers. The rest of the local business was flung to any person of
station who would consent to undertake it. Hence the “commission of the
peace,” and the perpetually increasing powers of judicature and
administration which were intrusted to “their worships, the justices.”
In almost all cases affecting the mass of the people they are the sole
tribunal, and without appeal, except to themselves in quarter sessions.
Almost every function or duty of a local nature, out of the corporate
towns, has been thrown upon them, for want of any one else to undertake
it. The administration of the poor laws is under their absolute
controul. Gaols must be superintended, therefore the magistracy must do
it. Gaolers must be appointed, therefore the magistracy must appoint
them. There must be somebody to impose county rates, and to regulate
their expenditure: who but the magistracy? Power to make roads and
footpaths, and to stop them up, must reside somewhere: where but in the
magistracy? Power must exist to preserve order in public places;
therefore the magistrates must have arbitrary power of licensing, and
arbitrary powers of restricting or of dispersing, assemblages of all
kinds.

Let any one tell who knows, how these powers, and others without end
which might be enumerated, are actually used. Interrogate any barrister
who practises at the quarter sessions, in which, of all places where the
magistracy reign, they are most under observation, and consequently most
under restraint; you will hear that of all places where public business
is done, that is the place where the most flagrant acts of injustice are
committed with the least scruple. And what wonder? The men who made corn
laws and game laws2 are the élite, the “choice and prime”3 of these men;
selected expressly as such, and exposed to the gaze of all mankind. If
such are the best, what must the worst be! If such is their conduct in
the great theatre of London and Parliament, with the press standing over
them rod in hand, what must it be in the dark corners, where the light
never penetrates, Edition: current; Page: [588] and where the voice of
complaint is never loud enough to be heard beyond the walls of the
beer-house?

These are the institutions of England which need reform: unless they be
reformed it is idle in practice and vain in theory to affect to reform
the Legislature. If the possession of a certain number of acres of land,
without any other requisite whatever, qualifies a man to administer the
laws in his own hall, why not in Westminster-hall? Let the man with the
greatest number of acres preside in the highest court: let the Duke of
Northumberland be Chief Justice, and the Duke of Sutherland,
Chancellor.4 If landed property be sufficient title for imposing county
taxes, why not for imposing king’s taxes? Why did we complain that the
great landholders nominated the House of Commons? We demand that the
principle which Earl Grey broadly laid down as the foundation of his
Parliamentary Reform, be taken for the foundation of Municipal Reform:
we demand “Representation, not Nomination.”5

The Local Courts of Justice which must speedily be established, and to
which, if so constituted as to work well, more and more of the judicial
business of the country will as certainly be confided; these will, in
time, gradually and quietly supersede the judicial functions of the
unpaid magistracy. Their administrative functions, including that of
local taxation, ought to be intrusted to local representative bodies, in
the election of which all rate-payers should have a voice. The
representative principle, though in a corrupt state, already operates in
the election of the authorities of many corporate towns, and by the late
Vestry Act6 it has been partially introduced into the affairs of
parishes. But, for most purposes, parochial management is on too small a
scale; the persons interested do not form a sufficiently numerous
public, nor is the publicity sufficient to fix the attention of that
public with the needful energy and constancy.

For every town there should be, as in France, a municipal council: for
every district equal in extent and population to an average county,
there should also be a council. In these councils should reside the
exclusive power of imposing local taxes, and of determining their
appropriation to local purposes. All local functionaries should make
periodical reports to them, and should act under their constant
surveillance. They should have the right of addressing the king for the
removal of any officer of Government within their district. The
multitude of private bills which now occupy the time of Parliament, to
the great hinderance of the proper duties of the Legislature, and the
success or rejection of which is now invariably determined by private
intrigue and jobbery, should (where they cannot be superseded, as in
many cases they might be, by general statutes framed once for all) be
turned over to these local assemblies. They should have the controul of
Edition: current; Page: [589] the local police, and the superintendence
of all schools and other establishments supported by public money or
private endowments. The purposes for which such bodies might be made
available will be found to be innumerable; and are mostly such as cannot
be even tolerably performed but by such means.

The necessity of such institutions is borne out by the authority both of
constitutional and of absolute Governments. In France, representative
bodies exist, chosen by a portion of the people, for the local taxation
and administration of every department, every arrondissement, and every
commune (township or village). In Prussia, a country which by the
excellence of the details of its institutions puts to shame all the
constitutional Governments of Europe, there have for some time existed
provincial assemblies, and other municipal bodies, on the principle of
popular election.7

If our country were to be judged by her laws, well might M. Cousin give
the palm of highest civilization to France and Prussia, “without
excepting England herself, all bristling with prejudices, gothic
institutions, and semibarbarous customs, over which there is awkwardly
thrown the mantle d’une civilisation toute matérielle.”* The opinion be
it remembered of no Jacobin or Republican, but of a French Whig, a
philosophic doctrinaire.

The Commissioners for Municipal Corporations should carry their views,
and even their recommendations, to the full length of what we have now
proposed. There would, indeed, be no hope that plans of so comprehensive
a character would at once be adopted; but the Commissioners need not
expect to carry all that they propose, let it be ever so little. Though
they pare down their reforms to the most inconsiderable dimensions,
there will be abundance of persons who will take care that not more than
half of what they ask shall be granted them. A Commission has this
advantage over a Ministry, that it is under no necessity of proposing no
more than can be carried; it may cast its bread on the waters, certain
that the world will find it after many days.8 A solemn declaration of
opinion from an authoritative quarter, going the full length of a great
principle, is worth ten paltry practical measures of nibbling amendment.
The good which any mere enactment can do, is trifling compared with the
effect of whatever helps to mature the public mind; without which, all
attempts to improve institutions must be failures, or at best only
palliatives. And besides, even in actual legislation, what is obtained
always bears some proportion to what is asked. Men may be frightened by
the extent of change proposed, but that very alarm makes changes which
would otherwise have seemed almost equally formidable, appear Edition:
current; Page: [590] moderate; and we always find that gradual reform
proceeds by larger and more rapid steps, when the doctrines of radical
reform are most uncompromisingly and intrepidly proclaimed.


212.: THE BANK CHARTER BILL [2]
 EXAMINER, 18 AUG., 1833, P. 514

For the background, see Nos. 208 and 209. This leading article in the
“Political Examiner” is headed as title. It is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “An article headed ‘The Bank Charter Bill’ in the
Examiner of 18th August 1833” (MacMinn, p. 33); in the Somerville
College set of the Examiner, it is listed as title and enclosed in
square brackets.

this piece of weak and ignorant legislation has passed through the
Committee, and may have passed the House of Commons before these lines
are printed; not entirely without improvement, but without the only
sufficient improvement, viz., annihilation.1 Never was the answer more
applicable which some one made to Pope when he exclaimed “God mend me.”
“God could more easily make twenty than mend the like of you.”2

The principal change for the better consists in the destruction of not
perhaps the worst, but the most undefended and indefensible of all the
exclusive privileges which the measure, as it originally stood,3 was
intended to prolong. The monopoly of the Bank is to extend no further
than to the supply of currency. For deposit and other banking purposes,
banks with more than six partners may henceforth be established in any
part of the United Kingdom. For this amendment we are indebted to no
conviction, to no enlightenment of the understandings of our Whig
Ministers, nor yet to the wisdom of the House overruling their folly. We
owe it to a singular discovery. Till now it had been believed that by
the law as it stood, no banking establishment with more than six
partners, except the Bank of England, could exist in London, or a circle
of sixty-five miles round it, or could have existed anywhere in the
kingdom, previously to the Act of 1826.4 Of a sudden it is discovered
that this interpretation of the law is wholly erroneous; that there is
not, nor has ever been any legal hindrance to the establishment of banks
with any number of partners; that the Legislature, every successive
Ministry, all parties interested in upholding Edition: current; Page:
[591] the monopoly, and all parties interested in breaking through it,
have been entirely mistaken in what so nearly concerned their duties,
their occupations, and their interests. A curious picture of the law and
of legislation; and a curious example too, if the fact really be as
stated, of the fallacy of the expectation that what it is peculiarly and
strongly men’s individual pecuniary interest to know, they will know;
for of all the innumerable adventurers, or those who would gladly have
been adventurers, in banking speculations, or who have actually founded
numerous associations for banking purposes in other parts of the kingdom
since 1826, if there had been one who had inspected the Act and given a
fee to Sir William Horne or Sir John Campbell for telling him its real
meaning, he must have learnt the very fact which those functionaries, as
the law authorities of the Crown, have just promulgated to a wondering
public.5

However, this being announced, put it in the power of Lord Althorp to
escape from the awkward position in which he had placed himself before
Parliament and the public by his hasty and silly measure, at no greater
expense than that of an evasion—the favourite resource of juste-milieu
politicians, as of all other waverers whether in public or private life.
Had Lord Althorp made confession to the Bank of a change of opinion; had
he said, “I was ignorant of the subject—I am now better instructed;” or
even, “This measure is unacceptable to Parliament and to the country,
and must, therefore, be modified in conformity to public opinion,” he
would have done that which, next to proposing at first a well considered
and well digested plan, would have been the noblest and wisest part a
Minister could have performed. A mere private arrangement between
Ministers and an interested party cannot, in common sense, bind a
servant of the nation to betray his trust by pressing a measure when he
has ceased to think it expedient, or to resign his office when the sworn
enemies of the people’s dearest principles and wishes must be his
successors. Lord Althorp’s engagement with the Bank was fulfilled when
he had proposed the measure. That engagement could not have been
forfeited by altering, or even by withdrawing the Bill, on the
occurrence of any real change in his opinion either of the measure
itself, or of the consequences to the public of persisting in it. The
use of the private correspondence was merely to ascertain what price the
Bank were willing to pay for what privileges, and if the privileges were
refused the Bank were released from paying the price; that was all.6

But this view of the matter was not adapted either to the optics or to
the nerves Edition: current; Page: [592] of a Lord Althorp. Observe his
mode of dealing with the pretended pledge. He owns it; but as it would
be inconvenient to keep it, he keeps it only “to the ear.” His bargain
was that the Bank should retain their existing exclusive privileges.7 It
is true that when this promise was made, Lord Althorp believed, and the
Bank believed, and the world believed that the Bank did possess the
privilege now in question; and, as long as this was the case, it is
obvious that they enjoyed all the advantages which the real possession
of the privilege could have given them. However, as the Attorney and
Solicitor-General affirm that the Bank had not what all the world
thought they had, it is not an existing privilege; and to refuse it to
them hereafter, though as complete a change in their position as if they
had really had it, happens not to be an infringement of the actual
letter of the engagement. This is enough for Lord Althorp; and to this
trick we are indebted for a riddance, which the most potent arguments,
urged and re-urged from the beginning to the end of a Session, never
would have procured for us.

The only other alteration for the better which this Bill has undergone,
is the permission given to country banks of issue, whatever be the
number of partners, to have agents in London and to make their notes
payable there. By means of this clause a door will, we trust, be opened
for the ultimate defeat even of those provisions of the Act which are
intended to secure to the Bank the exclusive supply of paper-currency to
the metropolis.

All attempts have failed to procure a shortening of the period of time
during which this Act, for which the best that can be hoped is that it
supplies the means for its own nullification, is to remain binding on
the country. The monopoly is granted for twenty years; once during that
period, namely, ten years from this time, it is to be subject to
revision. But, with the consent of the Bank it may be revised or
repealed at any moment; and before ten years have passed over us, times
may come at which, as in 1826, the voice of the public out of doors will
“act upon the prudence” of the Bank.

September 1833 to October 1834


213.: THE QUARTERLY REVIEW ON FRANCE
 EXAMINER, 1 SEPT., 1833, PP. 552-3

This article is a response to one by Mill’s consistent foe, John Wilson
Croker (see Nos. 37, 39, 40, and 355-8), who had published “French
Revolution of 1830,” Quarterly Review, XLIX (July 1833), 464-85. Mill’s
unheaded article, which is in the place where the summary of French news
normally appeared, is described in his bibliography as “An answer to a
paragraph in the Quarterly Review, standing as the summary of French
news in the Examiner of 1st September 1833” (MacMinn, p. 33). In the
Somerville College set of the Examiner, it is listed as “Article on
France, in reply to the Quarterly Review” and enclosed in square
brackets.

towards the conclusion of an article on France, in the last number of
the Quarterly Review, written in the true spirit of that review, which
may now be defined Toryism pretending to have grown desperate, we find
the following paragraph:

The state of siege, and the bold and bloody, yet necessary and
justifiable suppression of the sedition in June, 1832, have quieted
matters for the present; and the construction of a circle of fortresses
round Paris, under the flimsy and disgraceful pretext of guarding
against foreign invasion, but for the real and convenient (though not
very constitutional) purpose of bridling that turbulent town—will
transfer the national force from the populace to the army, and to him
who can maintain an ascendency over the army. When Marshal Soult shall
have finished the new Bastilles, for the erection of which the reformed
Chamber of France has voted so many millions, we shall hear of no more
revolutions made by the Faubourg St. Antoine, or the “gentlemen of the
press,” or the Elèves of the schools; and so weary is France of her
forty years of liberty, that she not only consents to enormous pecuniary
burdens to accomplish this astonishing tyranny, but she consents to it
for a reason which in other times would have made every Frenchman’s
blood boil with indignation—namely, that foreign armies can, when they
please, march unresisted to the very barriers of Paris!1

As an attempt to characterize the spirit and purposes of the present
French government, and the fraudulent and impudent pretexts on which
Louis-Philippe and Co. are not ashamed to rest the justification of a
measure intended to place Paris under the fire of fourteen citadels, the
statement of the Tory scribe does not Edition: current; Page: [594] even
come up to the mark. To have done justice to the subject, he should have
recited some of the evasions, tricks, and direct falsehoods, by which
the ministers attempted to palm this precious scheme upon the Chamber,
positively asserting (for instance) that no part of Paris was within
reach of cannon shot from any of the proposed forts;2 until M. Arago,
the eminent mathematician, demonstrated, in his place in the
legislature, that there is no part of Paris which could not be reached
by cannon shot from some one or other of them.3

However, the Quarterly Reviewer is out in one of his parts, and the most
important one. The designs he imputes to the French Government were
indeed entertained, but (thanks to the spirit of “liberty,” whereof, let
him lay it to his soul that France is not yet weary,) they were not
executed. The “reformed Chamber of France” did not vote “many millions”
for the erection of Bastilles, but, on the contrary, refused to vote a
single franc;4 and in consequence, the works, which had been already
commenced, (a favourite artifice of these Ministers, for extorting
money,) have been discontinued.

Let the Quarterly Reviewer look to this: he does not know his lesson; we
advise him to learn it better another time.

While we are on the subject, we will pause to ask, what considerable
improvement of the public mind is to be looked for under governors whom
every patriotic citizen, who mingles in public affairs, must not only be
perpetually watching with both his eyes, but perpetually holding with
both his hands, to hinder them from seizing on absolute power? It
required all the energy of the press and of public discussion applied
unremittingly to the subject for six months, to raise such a storm as
was sufficient to blow away these fourteen Bastilles; even now it is
said, the scheme is only postponed, and the fight must be renewed next
year; during all this time spent in repelling encroachments on the
ground which has been already gained, no progress is made towards
gaining more. While the public mind must be kept by its leaders and
instructors perpetually en garde, for the purpose of parrying some
expected or unexpected thrust at the very vitals of its freedom, it
cannot find time or attention for literature or philosophy, or social
morals, or education, or the best part of Edition: current; Page: [595]
politics—the improvement of the spirit and details of its institutions.
It is this which keeps back France. Great Britain is happy in having no
such obstacles. With us it is, at the worst, a question of more or less
rapid, and more or less skilful, improvements. We have no usurpation to
dread—no coup d’ état, with or without the form of law. That is a boon
we reserve for Ireland.


214.: THE MONTHLY REPOSITORY FOR SEPTEMBER 1833
 EXAMINER, 8 SEPT., 1833, P. 567

The fourth of Mill’s favourable notices of Fox’s periodical (see Nos.
198, 200, and 207) is headed “The Monthly Repository for September [n.s.
VII]. Edited by W.J. Fox”; references are to this volume. The review, in
the “Literary Examiner,” is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A
notice of the Monthly Repository for Septbr. 1833, in the Examiner of
18th [sic] Sept. 1833” (MacMinn, p. 34). In the Somerville College set
of the Examiner, it is listed as “Notice of the Monthly Repository for
September” and enclosed in square brackets.

this excellent periodical maintains its reputation. It continues to
pursue unflinchingly the same lofty purposes, and with the same high
range of merit in the execution. The best articles in the present number
are those entitled “Characteristics of English Aristocracy,” [pp.
585-601,] and “A stray chapter of the Autobiography of Pel. Verjuice,
with the Episode of the Dried Font.” [Pp. 623-44.] From the former we
have marked several passages to be extracted in another department of
our paper.1 Pel. Verjuice is full of the poetry of narrative and
description, with occasional touches of profound observation and
reflection. We rejoice to meet for the first time in the pages of this
work, the author of “Corn Law Rhymes,” and of other poems of still
greater merit.2 We regard this as an indication that the character and
merits of the Repository are becoming more generally known among those
for whom, above all others, it is designed, the single-hearted and
ardent reformers. The many have so few periodical writers on their side,
that they cannot too highly value one who, like the editor of this work,
stands almost unrivalled among those few.

215.: NOTE ON BENEFACTORS OF MANKIND
 EXAMINER, 8 SEPT., 1833, P. 570

This unheaded comment is described in the conclusion to the entry in
Mill’s bibliography for No. 214: “and a foot-note to an extract from the
Repository in the Notabilia of the same paper [i.e., the Examiner for 18
[sic] September]” (MacMinn, p. 34). In the Somerville College set of the
Examiner, the item is listed as “Passage appended to an extract from the
Monthly Repository” and enclosed in square brackets.

true;1 but those who should look to it are not the Miltons and Marvels,
but those whom the Miltons and Marvels serve. They are the losers. Such
men do not serve for hire, or they would go serve other masters. They
say, and have said, in all ages, in the words of Pope,

What then? is the reward of virtue bread?2


216.: THE MINISTERIAL MANIFESTO
 EXAMINER, 22 SEPT., 1833, PP. 593-5

This leader, strongly expressing Radical discontent with the Whig
ministry, was followed in quick succession by six more (Nos. 217-21 and
223), all in reply to The Reform Ministry, and the Reformed Parliament
(London: Ridgway, 1833), which went through nine editions. Though it was
written in part by the ministers, its nominal author was Denis Le
Marchant (1795-1874), a lawyer, principal secretary to Brougham, and
intimate friend of Althorp’s, who had prepared reports for the ministers
on the Reform Bill debates. Writing to Carlyle on 5 Oct., Mill says: “I
have been very busy and active in writing lately; even on politics; did
you detect me in those long-winded answers (in the Examiner) to the
ministerial pamphlet? but I tell it not to the profane” (EL, CW, Vol.
XII, p. 181). At that date only the first had appeared, but obviously
the second (which appeared the next day) and almost certainly all the
others had been written, for he left for Paris on 10 Oct. for his
romantic interlude with Harriet Taylor, not returning until about 20
Nov., by Edition: current; Page: [597] which time the series had
concluded. Writing of “The Close of the Session” in the Monthly
Repository, n.s. VIII (Sept. 1834), Mill has occasion to recall what the
Examiner had said at the end of the previous year’s session (CW, Vol.
VI, p. 286), though he does not admit the articles to be his. The whole
series appears in the “Political Examiner,” headed as title; this
article is a first leader. The leaders are described in Mill’s
bibliography as “A series of articles in reply to a ministerial pamphlet
which appeared in the Examiner of the following dates and under the
following titles: September 22d 1833 ‘The Ministerial Manifesto’ /
September 29th 1833 ‘The Marvellous Ministry’ / October 6th 1833 ‘The
Review of the Session continued’ / October 13th 1833 ‘Lord Brougham’s
Law Reforms’ / October 20th 1833 ‘The Corporation Bill’ (signed A.B.) /
October 27th 1833 ‘Conduct of the Ministry with respect to the Poor Law’
(also signed A.B.) / November 10th 1833 ‘Conduct of the Ministry with
respect to the Post Office Department, and the payment of officers by
fees’ ” (MacMinn, p. 34). In the Somerville College set of the Examiner,
“The Ministerial Manifesto” is listed as title and enclosed in square
brackets, with one correction: at 605.31-2 “from abuses” is altered to
“from the reform of abuses”.

some one has remarked, that a political pamphlet is to our modern world
what an oration was to the democracies of antiquity: and there is much
justice in the comparison. Demosthenes, when all the acts of his
administration were made the subject of a state prosecution, directed
not against himself but against a friend who had proposed to confer
honours upon him, vindicated his aspersed character by the noblest
monument of inspiring and dignified eloquence which mankind have
inherited.1 No one that we have heard of has placed himself in jeopardy,
by proposing to confer any honours upon the present Ministry: yet they
have thought themselves called upon to produce their little “Oration on
the Crown,” and here it is.

One of the differences, however, between Demosthenes and Lord Althorp
(besides others, which it is unnecessary to particularize) is, that
Demosthenes composed and spoke his own vindication; Lord Althorp, or
whomsoever else we are to consider as the representative of the
Ministry, has caused his to be composed and sent forth by an
understrapper. Now we confess a preference for the old ways. We like to
hear what a man can find to say in his own justification. We would
gladly learn, not what reasons can be found for one man’s doings after
they are done, by another man who had no hand in them; but what were the
very reasons which influenced the man’s own mind. Any person in office
can find somebody to point to what he has done, and cry Huzza! but it is
quite another matter when the Minister himself is called upon for his
own explanation of the principles of his measures. A compte rendu by the
Whig Ministry of the principles of theirs, would be worth having. It
would do Lord Althorp infinite good to attempt the composition of one.
Could but our Ministers once find in Edition: current; Page: [598] their
hearts to commit themselves to a principle, fairly embark themselves
with a principle, wed it for better for worse! But no—they are afraid of
principles; they are of that kind of persons who never can see the
consequences of principles: they are children, and principles are
edge-tools: they have no confidence in principles, because they have no
confidence, and do not deserve to have any, in their own capacity of
either in the first place choosing right ones, or, in the second, of
discerning where the dominion of one principle is limited by the
conflicting operation of another. They are men of shifts and expedients.
What they are from the necessity of their own want of knowledge and
judgment, they fancy they are from the necessity of the case. It is
their notion of statesmanship. It has been the notion of such statesmen
as they are, in all ages.

But if this were statesmanship, and if all their measures, from the
greatest to the smallest, had been such as absolute wisdom would have
dictated, no Ministers who ever existed have done less, the Reform Bill
excepted, to found vanity and self-complacency upon, than these. For,
the little tricks and devices and moyens de gouvernement of other
Ministers have sometimes been their own; but this Ministry has hardly
ever done anything but give way to the suggestions of others. Never was
there a Ministry whose own will, or whose own opinions, had so little to
do with their actions; if actions they can be called which were the
result of mere passiveness. The question with them has seldom been, what
is right? but, what will meet with least resistance? what will be
easiest to carry? And even in that, they have not looked beyond the two
Houses of Lords and Commons to the nation, nor beyond the present year
to the next. Yet a more self-complacent, self-applauding Ministry, one
possessed with a profounder sense of its own absolute wisdom, is not
perhaps recorded in history.

We can understand that a Minister who has taken office to realize some
grand and long-cherished scheme of improvement, and who, by the wisdom
and vigour of his councils, has triumphed over all the obstacles opposed
to him by interest and ignorance, and accomplished his end, may look
back to his successful efforts with feelings of self-gratulation and
pride. We can pardon the Ministers for feeling considerable exultation
at their success in carrying the Reform Bill. We can understand, again,
that a Minister whose object has been to resist innovation, to keep
things as they are, to uphold institutions, and when abuses are
inextricably interwoven with the texture of the institutions, to uphold
abuses; that a Minister who has been consistently conservative, who has
opposed a bold and unyielding front to the spirit of the age, may feel
elevated by the thought that he has done all that man could do for a
good cause, and if he has not been wholly victorious, has at least
prevented much evil. There is a third kind of Minister whom we could
allow to take to himself, to whom we could cheerfully give, a large
share of credit for his administration. This would be a man who, taking
the reins of office in a period of transition, a period which is called,
according to the opinions of the speaker, an age of reform, of
destruction, or of renovation, Edition: current; Page: [599] should deem
it his chief duty and his chief wisdom to moderate the shock: to mediate
between adverse interests; to make no compromise of opinions, except by
avoiding any ill-timed declaration of them, but to negociate the most
advantageous compromises possible in actual measures: to reform
bit-by-bit, when more rapid progress is impracticable, but always with a
comprehensive and well-digested plan of thorough reform placed before
him as a guide, and so that the partial reforms, one and all, may fit
well into the general reform which is ultimately to be effected; to be
ingenious in the contrivance of means by which the greatest amount of
public good may be attained with the smallest loss to individual
interests, and that loss again made up (when made up it ought to be) at
the smallest expense to the public. Such a minister might be indulged in
some feelings of triumph. But for a Ministry to sing hymns in their own
glory for a set of measures in which they have had scarcely any share
but as passive instruments, either of a strong popular cry or of some
interested parties—which they have never known how to defend, even when
defensible—of which they have shown themselves ready to give up the
whole or any part, not indeed upon argument, but upon any show of strong
opposition—into which they have really put nothing from their own minds,
except such crudities as they were obliged to surrender at the first
summons—and have had no resource for making the machinery work smoothly,
but that of flinging public money to all who were dissatisfied, with a
lavishness for which we can seek a parallel in none but the most
profligate Governments,—this, truly, is too much. And yet these men are
fully persuaded that no one, not perverted by factious motives or a
splenetic disposition, can fail to join his voice in the chorus of
praise!

It could be worth no man’s while to devote an article to the examination
of the pamphlet before us. It is a summary of the legislative measures
of the Session;2 as such, it serves the convenience of a day: beyond
this, it has no merits to stand upon, but those of the cause it
advocates; it shines, if at all, solely with the lustre of the deeds
which it commemorates. Nearly all it does is to state the substance of
each of the measures which the Ministry have carried through Parliament,
and after each to applaud long and loudly. When ground is attempted to
be laid for the applause by any arguments, it is by the most meagre
abstract of those which were employed in the discussion.

This piece of advocacy, we must observe, is grounded on a part only of
the facts. It passes over three-fourths of the essentials of the case.
It builds a lofty eulogium of the Ministry, exclusively upon what they
have done. But their merits or demerits are compounded of what they have
done, of what they have opposed, and so prevented from being done, of
what they have failed in doing, and of what they have said. This last is
by no means the least, is perhaps even the Edition: current; Page: [600]
most important. The words of a statesman are deeds: the words of a
reforming statesman have often greater results of good or evil than any
other of his actions; for doctrines, in times like ours, weigh heavier
in the balance of events than Acts of Parliament; and the doctrines
which a Minister lays down may be large and comprehensive, and may help
to educate the public mind for better things, while the measures of even
the best Minister must be, for a long time to come, the result of a
thousand compromises with adverse interests and prejudices. The sayings,
too, of a Minister, in these times, are so much more his own, so much
stronger an indication of the direction of his inclinations, than the
remainder of his doings. Public affairs and the public mind are in a
state which must compel any Minister to adopt many measures of reform.
But it is what he says that enables us to judge whether his heart goes
with what he does; whether if he could he would do less, or whether if
he could he would do more. Nothing can be more unfortunate in this
respect than the conduct of the present Ministers. They might have been
excused for proposing half-measures, and even for what it is harder to
excuse, giving up half of even the half-measures they proposed; had they
but so spoken as to give the public assurance that their will was
greater than their power. But instead of this, they made professions and
adopted language, which seemed even intended to persuade every body of
what we believe to be quite unfounded, that not the doing so little
good, but the doing even that little, was forced upon them.

The advocate of the Ministry has judiciously kept all these things out
of sight. He sees not, or if he sees, owns not, that men who talk as
Tories, will never be trusted to for continuing to act as Reformers;
that men who defend sinecures, and impressment, and the jobs in the
Post-office, and who say that nine of every ten Englishmen would regret
to see the Bishops turned out of the House of Lords, and that triennial
Parliaments are inconsistent with the Monarchy, will never gain much
credit for loosing their hold of a few abuses which the most inveterate
Tory could not any longer hope to maintain.3 The people are ready enough
to take the will for the deed, but they will not, in opposition to all
appearances, take the extorted deed for the will.

Had the acts of the first Session been all that could be expected, a
really reforming Ministry would have declined to be judged by them. It
would have said, for it would have felt, “We could not in the first
Session rationally hope to effect much; receive ye the little which we
have done as an earnest of the much which we intend, and judge whether
our doctrines and professions are those of Edition: current; Page: [601]
men who are determined to go forward, or of people who are looking both
ways at once, and providing themselves beforehand with a cover for an
eventual retreat.”

Thus would have felt and spoken a brave and high-minded Ministry. But
the advocate of these, is forced to drop all notice of that part of
their conduct which might have been grand and comprehensive and
courageous, their declarations of opinion and intention; and has rested
their claims to admiration upon that part which must, let the men be
what they would, have been narrow and petty and half-and-half—their Acts
of Parliament.

Take one glance at these Acts of Parliament. Look down the table of
contents of this our pamphleteer; see, in heaven’s name, what they are,
these gifts of the Reform Ministry, for which we can never laud them too
extravagantly, or bow our heads too low to do them homage. Ten years, or
even five years ago, some of these things might have been matter of
praise; but now! to hear a Ministry deified for the Irish Church Bill!
for the Slave Bill! for the East India Bill! for the Bank Bill! for the
Factory Bill!4

Have we now a reformed House of Commons, or have we not? Is the
deliberate and strong conviction of the middle classes, the arbiter of
our government, or is it not? If it is, where is the mighty merit, where
is the merit of any kind, if some one or two popular objects have been
accomplished after the discomfiture of the boroughmongers, more than
would have been adopted by Parliament while the boroughmongers were in
their strength? Even this moderate claim on our applauses does not
belong to all the above measures. What Minister, even with an unreformed
Parliament, would not have opened the China trade?5 The Duke of
Wellington had officially notified his intention of doing so.6 What
Minister, when the Bank Charter expired, would not have made some new
arrangement with the Bank? What Ministry after Parliamentary Reform,
could have avoided making some reform in the Irish Church? and what
Ministry could have made that reform less? What Ministry could have
helped passing some Factory Bill? and what Ministry could have passed
the Ten Hours’ Bill, without considerable amendments?7 What Ministry
could have helped making retrenchments? and what other Ministry could
have made so much retrenchment go such Edition: current; Page: [602] a
little way in affording relief? What Ministry could have helped, in the
excited state of the public mind at the opening of Parliament,
introducing some measure to provide for the speedy and complete
emancipation of the negroes?

The merit of doing all these things, as is obvious to any person of
common sense, could not possibly consist in the things themselves, but
in the manner of doing them. And in the manner, which alone could be a
ground of either praise or blame to the Ministers, they have deserved
scarcely any praise, and a large measure of blame.

Take, first, their Slave Bill. It is scarcely worth while to recall to
the memory of the public, which speedily loses the impression of
abortive absurdities, what this measure was in its native crudity, in
its first unlicked state, when, after a fortnight’s gestation, it
started forth, not like Minerva, from the brain of Mr. Stanley, and
having staggered for a few paces tottered and fell.8 That precious
scheme, by which the slave was to be called a freeman, and under that
title was to work by compulsion three-fourths of his time for a master,
and the other fourth for wages which he was not to receive, but which
were to be paid to the Government in order to be repaid to the master;
that notable scheme by which the master was to be indemnified out of his
own pocket; one-fourth of the labour of his slave being taken from him
without compensation, and he being compelled to buy it back, in order
that the money thus extorted from himself might be returned to him as
compensation for what had been taken away!—these marvellous contrivances
deserve to live only as examples of the “strange tricks” which may be
played “before high heaven”9 by a raw journeyman statesman, aptly, by
Mr. O’Connell, denominated a shave-beggar,10 when he extemporizes an act
of legislation in reliance upon intuitive genius, without either
knowing, or consulting those who know, anything of the subject.

Edition: current; Page: [603]
These nonsensical phantasies, below the intelligence of an average
schoolboy, could have passed, we confidently trust, no assembly of sane
men in Christendom, and could not pass our House of Commons. Instead of
them what have we got? Let us look at the provisions of the measure as
they now stand.

The people of England were bent upon immediate emancipation: there were
fears that in the imputed parsimony of a democratic Government, they
would even demand the flagrant injustice of emancipation without
compensation. The result proves one thing at least, that the danger did
not lie that way. Have they obtained what they demanded? They have not.
The slaves are not wholly and at once emancipated. Compulsory labour
continues, and is to continue for six years. But though the slaves have
obtained but a part, the people of England have paid the price of the
whole. On the best official calculations which could be made, the twenty
millions which have been granted are, as nearly as can be estimated, the
full market price of all the slaves in our colonies. Emancipation
without compensation was apprehended; but who ever dreamed that the gift
of a reformed Parliament would be compensation without emancipation;
that England would buy the slaves out and out, and not make them free!
The masters are to have the full price of their slaves and part of the
slaves’ labour too. An act of national justice is turned into a job for
putting public money into the pockets of the owners of slaves.

And the slaves themselves; how is their well-being provided for? The
opponents of immediate emancipation contended, and justly contended,
that the good of the slave demanded a gradual relaxation of his bonds,
in such a manner and by such steps that habits of voluntary industry,
prudence, and self-controul, unnecessary in a state of slavery, but
essential to the enjoyment and to the good use of freedom, might take
root in his mind before he was altogether set free. To accomplish this
purpose, what have the Ministers established? A system of pauper labour!
ay, the very system the condemnation of which their own Poor Law
Commissioners have made resound through every corner of the country;11
the system which awards subsistence to the labourer not according to his
work, but according to his wants, and enforces labour, not by
withholding wages, but by the powers of the magistrate; that most
unhappy compromise between a state of slavery and a state of freedom,
which combines only the evils of both; which renders labour odious by
dissevering it from its reward, more completely than in slavery itself;
the very system which has destroyed the industry and morality of the
industrious and moral English peasant, have these sages adopted as a
means of moralizing and training to voluntary industry men who have
always been slaves!

It is for this that twenty millions have been added to the amount of the
National Edition: current; Page: [604] Debt, and more than a hundred
millions, as the event, we fear, will prove, to its unpopularity! Yet
the sole chance for the working of such a system without the most
calamitous consequences, lies in the very extravagance of the
compensation. The only hope for the slaves is now in the colonial
legislatures. The unexpected magnitude of the gift may allay their
irritated feelings, and leave their eyes so far open to their true
interest as to see the policy of exchanging the forced apprenticeship
for a voluntary contract between master and servant for work and wages.

Let it not be said, that although this measure has its inconveniences,
inconveniences of perhaps equal amount would have attended any attempt
to accomplish at once the difficult transition from the disease of
slavery to the healthful state of free labour. A most simple
modification and extension of the Spanish system of manumission
(actually advocated in Parliament by Mr. Charles Buller,)12 would at
just one-sixth of the expense, have united compensation to the planters
with a speedier emancipation to the slave. If the Legislature, instead
of buying the whole of the slave’s labour, had bought for him the free
use of one day in the week, and having fixed his price, had permitted
him, on tendering one-sixth part of it, to purchase another and another
day until completely emancipated; it may be shown by a simple
calculation founded on the known rate of wages in the colonies, that a
slave who employed the whole leisure thus obtained in working for wages,
and the whole of those wages in purchasing the remainder of his freedom,
would have achieved it, not in six but in about three years. Not only
would the association have been the closest conceivable between labour
and its reward, and the incentive to voluntary labour the strongest
possible, but every slave would have had the power, if he chose to exert
it, of being emancipated in a much shorter time than by the present
plan; by means of voluntary, not as at present of forced labour: the
moral, prudent, and industrious slave would have been emancipated first,
and those who would have waited longest for freedom would have been
precisely those who were least fitted for it. This combination of almost
immediate emancipation with the best possible moral education for the
negro, would have cost this country between three and four millions; and
it is paying twenty for—what we have described.

But the Irish Church Bill! And what have the people gained by the Irish
Church Bill? Except the Irish landlords, who will profit by the
abolition of the Vestry Cess, what human creature will derive one
particle of advantage from the Irish Church Bill? We beg pardon; we had
overlooked the better cultivation of the church lands, which is a
possible consequence of the abolition of fines for the renewal of
leases.13 That is the sum total of the public benefit which will be
derived from this vaunted Bill.

Edition: current; Page: [605]
The few who still believe that there ought to be a Protestant Church of
Ireland, may deem it a wonderful gain that the number and emoluments of
the Bishops and richer clergy of that Church are to be reduced, and the
savings converted to the general purposes of the Establishment. But what
rational person sees anything to care for in this? Not the manner in
which the plunder is distributed, but that they are plundered at all, is
the complaint of the Irish people: that tithes are wrung from them, and
their national property is detained from them, for the emolument of a
priesthood who are not of them, whose faith they believe not, by whose
existence they benefit not. The question is not now concerning the
abstract utility of Church Establishments. The warmest friends to the
Church of England have thought and think, that rich endowments, if
useful for maintaining a religion, are most ineffectual for propagating
it, and that the only Protestant Church suited to the condition of
Ireland is a Missionary Church. The famous clause which asserted the
right of the State to divert, not the endowments, but the additional
value which it was supposed was about to be given to the endowments, to
other purposes than those of the church, was never of much value as the
assertion of a principle; such as it was, however, it was given up, for
a reason worthy of quack politicians, that a principle, unless much was
to be gained by its being immediately acted upon, was not worth
contending about!14 When will they learn that the assertion of a single
great principle of political morality is worth any twenty of such paltry
measures as theirs?

The Church of England in Ireland must be swept away altogether. We do
not blame the Ministers for not having done this at once, but if we
could we would do it at once: the nuisance and insult should disappear
from the soil of Ireland without delay, and cease forthwith to irritate
her people. Pensions however should be given to the existing incumbents,
equal to the amount of their present net incomes, abating the expenses
now required by their station. Nor let it be forgotten that in the first
edition of this Bill, it was proposed by the Whig Ministers to tax
existing incumbents, and that the Radical members were foremost among
those who forced them to abandon that meditated infringement of an
important principle.15 Those who are liable to suffer from the reform of
abuses may be taught by this, that though they will obtain less favour,
they will have more justice, from the thorough, than from the
half-and-half reformers; and Edition: current; Page: [606] that it is at
least as much their interest, as it is the interest of all the rest of
the community, that the reforms which must come, should be effected by
those who will effect them on principle—not by those who, remaining
motionless till forced to move, and having then no rule but to trim
between adverse parties and give a little to one and a little to the
other, are as likely to make the just rights, as the unjust pretensions,
of both sides, burnt-offerings in the propitiatory sacrifice.

But what consistency, what rational principle of action can be in the
minds of men who with one hand eradicate ten Bishops from the Irish
Church,16 with the other, plant a hopeful commencement of an Irish
Church in India;17 adding two new Bishops to the one who already
existed, at the expense not of the European residents, who alone can
benefit by them, but of the poor, overburthened cultivators of the soil;
the pretence at first made of incurring no additional expense being
almost immediately abandoned; and, to buy off the opposition of Mr.
O’Connell and of Mr. Sinclair,18 more money wrung from the poor Hindoos
to pay more clergy for the Catholics and the Presbyterians! Was this a
time to create new Bishoprics, when the word Bishop stinks in the
nostrils of two-thirds of the people? Was this a time to add to the
expenses of Church Establishments? The only opposition to this enormity
was made by several of the Radical members;19 who almost alone took the
trouble to attend the later discussions on the India Bill, and were the
cause, almost exclusively, of the few improvements it has undergone. We
have no room to show up all the crudities of this most ill-digested
Bill; and enumerate all the modes in which it heaps additional expenses
on a people, whose taxes, though higher than they can bear, do not even
now suffice for the expenses of their government. We will only mention
that the Bill originally contained a clause which would have raised a
religious war all over India, by turning loose, on account of the mere
name of slaves, the inmates of every harem in the country;20 and that in
opposition to the unanimous opinion of the Court of Directors, the Bill
perpetuates and enlarges the monopoly of the most signally ill-conducted
public institution of education in Great Britain (and that is saying
much)—the College at Haileybury.21

Edition: current; Page: [607]
The Bank Bill! here, at least, is a measure, vicious in its very
principle, bad almost from the beginning to the end; a Bill for the
prolongation and enlargement, not the extinction, of a monopoly which
Lord Liverpool, seconded at that time by one of the members of the
present Ministry, made no secret of his intention to destroy.22 We have
entered fully into the demerits of this Bill on a recent occasion.23 The
subject, no doubt, was intricate, and authorities differed; there is
more excuse for the blunders of the Ministry on this question than on
some others, but surely no ground for praise. Their mode of making up
their opinion on this subject is characteristic of the quality of their
minds. Incapable of forming his own judgment, Lord Althorp sought for
authority on which he might rely;24 for practical authority, if we may
adopt the phrase of those who have faith in blind routine, but not in
reason. And whither resorted he for this trustworthy guidance? To the
London bankers! as if dealing in money made men conversant with the
principles of currency; or as if he should consult the man who drives
his coach, concerning the best mode of building it. His coachman, at
least, would have no interest different from his own: not so the London
bankers; whose habits, whose riches, whose importance, were all
identified with the system by which they had thriven, and could not, and
cannot, but receive a considerable shock from even so slight a
modification of that system as has actually taken place.

We must pause here; but the subject is not half exhausted. Undeserved
panegyric provokes the utterance of censure, which else might have
remained unspoken. Their own pamphlet has opened up the entire question
of the merits of their administration; the papers in their interest have
vaunted it as a triumphant display of merits beyond appreciation, to
which none but Tories or Destructives25 can affect to be insensible; and
by their good leave and that of the public, they shall hear the other
side too. They shall learn what men who are neither Tories nor
Destructives, but cautious though earnest reformers, think of them and
of their measures. We shall resume our examination in the next paper.

217.: THE MARVELLOUS MINISTRY
 EXAMINER, 29 SEPT., 1833, PP. 609-11

For the entry in Mill’s bibliography and the context of this second
leading article in reply to Le Marchant’s The Reform Ministry, see No.
216. In the Somerville College set of the Examiner, the article is
listed as title and enclosed in square brackets.

we resume our examination of the Ministerial Manifesto.

The first Session of the Reformed Parliament has been prolific in
legislation concerning Ireland. Besides producing an Irish Church Bill,
it has also produced an Irish Tithe Bill, and an Irish Coercion Bill.1
Not only for the so-called Church Reform, but for the Tithe Bill, and
even for the Coercion Bill, applause is claimed in behalf of the
Ministry by this unwearied eulogist. They have placed Ireland under
martial law, and outrages have ceased. “They made the giants first, and
then they killed them.”2 The outrages were wholly a consequence of the
insane attempt to enforce the collection of tithe; and have been put an
end to, not by the Coercion Bill, but by the cessation of that dignified
contest, in which horse, foot, and artillery took the field to enable a
collector to sell a poor man’s pig, and the pig returned home unsold!
The Tithe Bill set the final legislative seal to the relinquishment of
claims which had already been tacitly abandoned. The lawless
outbreakings of the Irish are of the nature of rebellion; they are the
mode in which that nation resist what they deem oppression, and they
have drawn off their forces because the enemy have sounded a retreat.
Ministers chose rather to alienate a whole people than confess
themselves vanquished, and their Coercion Bill, which looked so fierce
and has proved so gentle, turns out to have been, as Lord Grey said of a
foolish lord’s foolish speech, “all sound and fury, signifying
nothing;”3 a mere flourish of trumpets, to give a defeat the air of a
triumph; and John Bull pays for all. No marvel if the Irish are quiet,
having got all they desired.

But to understand how far the wisdom, the foresight of Ministers has
reached in the matter of Irish Tithe, it is necessary to go a little
further back.

When they came into office the passive resistance had commenced: the
clergy could not collect their tithe, and that unpopular impost had
practically repealed Edition: current; Page: [609] itself. As usual, the
redress which would have been denied to justice was granted to force,
and the injury we had no longer the power of inflicting, we
magnanimously resolved to forbear to inflict. Mr. Stanley, the
“shave-beggar,”4 as careless of his words as of his actions, and equally
incapable of weighing the consequences of either, proclaimed the
“extinction of tithes.”5 But while tithes were to be extinguished in
futurum, the existing arrear was to be exacted at the bayonet’s point;
not, to be sure, for the value of the sum, which besides would be almost
all swallowed up by the expense of collection, but to “enforce respect
for the law.”6 And nobly the scheme has succeeded, and glorious is the
respect which has redounded to the law and to all law from this
well-advised enterprise! After exhibiting the whole strength of a
Government, with all its civil and all its military apparatus, arrayed
against an unarmed people, and by that unarmed people baffled and
disgraced for two entire years; after teaching to the Irish, aye, and to
the English and Scotch, a lesson of successful disobedience of the laws,
which they will never forget, which they are even now putting in
practice all over the land; after wantonly establishing for this single
purpose a precedent, the reach of which passes the bounds of human
conjecture, a precedent for placing a whole nation out the pale of
law—it has even come to this, that the thing is impossible, and must be
abandoned. But old rules are reversed; in these our days it is the
beaten who triumph! They have not the excuse of the blind, that they had
blind guides. They were warned of all this. They were told that the
tithe would not be paid. They were told that all their efforts to exact
it would only cover themselves with ridicule, and involve the law and
the Government in still deeper detestation. They were told that of the
two evils, if it were necessary to choose one, it was far preferable
that England, even England, which from time immemorial has paid the
price whoever else reaped the gain, should indemnify the parsons, and
bribe them to let the tithe-payers alone: though the funds which ought
on every rational principle to have borne the burthen, were the
endowments of the Church of Ireland. The Ministers were deaf to these
warnings. They persisted in their folly. As they have sown so have they
reaped. We have had the disgraceful contest between the people and the
Government. We have had the triumph of anarchy, the successful defiance
of the law. We have had their Coercion Bill, their martial law, on the
pretext of punishing that defiance. And after all this evil has been
incurred we have likewise that other evil, which had it been inflicted
to prevent the former, we might better have endured. Since the people of
Ireland will not pay tithe, they will not be required to pay, and the
people of England are paying it in their stead. Memorable result of the
combined wisdom and vigour of a memorable Ministry! Were it only for
Edition: current; Page: [610] this, they will live in the remembrance of
men as long as a signal example shall be wanted of feebleness joined
with presumption.

Even what they have at last done, they had not the good sense nor the
courage to do spiritedly, directly, and above board. They could give
twenty millions to the West India planters, but they did not like to
propose to give one million to the Irish clergy: it was therefore lent.
Lent to whom? to the clergy doubtless; to be repaid then by the clergy?
not at all: to be repaid by the landlord. But the landlord! why the
landlord? by what right? with what colour of justice? Why single out
from the nation one class, (a class, it is true, little used to be
selected for undergoing injustice,) and require them to pay a debt which
is not theirs, which was incurred by the obstinacy and improvidence of
the Government? True; it would be unjust to lay it on the landlords, on
the landlords therefore it shall not lie. Where then to place it? Now
will the historian of a future age open his eyes and stare with
astonishment at the device which was hit upon to reconcile all
difficulties. The clergy are to be indemnified by the State, the State
is to be indemnified by the landlords, and the landlords, bless the
mark! are to be indemnified by the tithe-owing tenant. The origin and
motive of the whole proceeding was that the Government itself, having
gone forth with soldiers and field-pieces to collect the tithes, had
been unable to accomplish it; and what the State has given up as
desperate, it turns over to the landlords, as satisfaction for what it
forces them to pay in quite other coin; as though it should confiscate
the whole of their earthly estates, and assign to them a corresponding
number of acres in nubibus by way of compensation! The very best
supposition the case admits of, for the credit of Ministers, is that the
whole transaction was a premeditated fraud. They should instruct their
friends to give out that they knew the indemnity was a delusion; that
they knew the tenant could not be forced to pay to the landlord what he
could not be forced to pay to the State; and that their object was to
lay a partial tax upon the Irish landowners without avowing the
intention.

We pass to their measures relating to the public revenue and
expenditure, and the kindred subject of commercial legislation.

The Ministerial pamphleteer insists with great emphasis upon the
retrenchments which have been accomplished, and of which he makes an
elaborate display.7 He is much in the right; no part of the conduct of
his patrons makes a fairer show; pity that it is but a show! Their
advocate has seized, perhaps, the only moment in the history of their
administration, at which the merit of economy could colourably be
attributed to them. The expenses which they have retrenched have just
ended, those which they have caused are only about to begin. They have
remitted taxes, since they came into office, to the amount altogether of
more than three millions; but unless the retrenchments they have
Edition: current; Page: [611] effected are but a trifle to those they
will yet effect, wait and see what are the new taxes they will be
obliged to lay on. Twenty millions to the West India planters, of which
all but about three and a half were sheer waste; a million to the Irish
clergy; nearly two millions (we forget the exact sum) lent, or what is
the same thing, given, to the baby King of Greece;8 the interest of all
this has to be provided for by new taxes: besides an indefinite annual
sum for supplying all the West India colonies with what the mother
country has never yet had the good fortune to possess, viz., a
stipendiary magistracy, a police, and universal education. Several
millions are, moreover, to be repaid to the East India Company and to
the Bank: sums which had been lent to Government, part of them, we
believe, at no interest at all, the whole of them at less than the
market rate. Some of these expenses Ministers proposed to meet by an
extra tax on colonial sugar;9 but they must be very simple people who
can believe that sugar will not already be extra-taxed beyond all
endurance. Ministers have looked to that matter already. Perhaps it was
an inevitable effect of the emancipation of the negroes in whatever
manner, but certainly of their emancipation in the thoughtless and
clumsy manner in which our present rulers have decreed it, that the
supply of sugar from our colonies must greatly diminish, and its price
rise in a corresponding proportion, perhaps to even treble or quadruple
the existing prices. In order that this last desirable effect may be
made more sure, Ministers, in so far as depended upon them, have
guaranteed to the West Indians the continuance of their present monopoly
of the home market. It is, indeed, quite out of the question that
Parliament should pay the slightest regard to any such pretended
engagement; but it will be many years before Asia can afford a supply
equal to the demands of Europe: and to admit the produce of foreign
slave colonies after abolishing slavery in ours, would be to stultify
our own measure; it would be renouncing, not injustice, but only the
fruits of injustice, and continuing to be accessaries in the guilt for
the profit of others. Instead therefore of increasing, Ministers will,
more probably, be compelled to diminish the duties on sugar; and either
way, new taxes must be found to make up for the partial drying up of one
of the largest sources of our revenue. A similar observation applies to
another of the most productive of our taxes, the tax on tea.10 Hitherto
this duty has been collected at absolutely no expense: hereafter the
charges of collection will be as great as in the case of other taxes;
and it is at least problematical whether the effect of opening the trade
to the unlimited Edition: current; Page: [612] competition of buyers,
while the sellers in China are a close company of monopolists, and
smuggling* almost impossible, will not be to raise instead of lowering
the price of the article in the English market, and consequently to
diminish the consumption and the revenue.

Under these financial disadvantages, all of their own creating,
Ministers must bestir themselves again, and vigorously, in the work of
retrenchment, if they would avoid the humiliating necessity of laying on
taxes to more than the amount of those which they have recently taken
off.

And their choice of taxes to be remitted; could it have been more
unhappily made? To their first Budget, indeed, this criticism does not
apply.11 Memorable were the blunders of that Budget; but it was in
laying on taxes, not in taking them off. In that one year, Ministers
were luckily guided, in their remissions of taxes, by Sir Henry
Parnell’s book;12 following that, they could not go far wrong; and they
relieved us from several of the worst of our indirect taxes. There were
two features of great merit in that first Budget, which have disappeared
from the subsequent ones—an encroachment upon the Canada timber
monopoly, (equal to a tax of one million a-year,) and a reduction of the
Stamp Duty on Newspapers.13 Ministers were frightened out of the former
of these meritorious purposes, by a single defeat, in the unreformed
House of Commons. As to the latter, their hearts failed them; and
whether it was pusillanimity or treachery, Lord Althorp, (disclaiming
all the while any agency in the enforcement of the law,) said that the
tax ought to be abolished, and took off a million and a half of other
taxes instead.14 And what a selection! A sort of perverted genius was
shown in finding the means of giving away a million and a half a-year in
perpetuity, and pleasing no one—conferring a perceptible relief upon
nobody. The secret of this was, excessive eagerness to do a little for
everybody. Not a tax, except a few of trifling amount, was entirely
repealed; only halves and quarters of taxes; the remaining part
continuing to be collected at the same expense absolutely as the whole,
and, of course, at a far greater proportionally; and the worst evil of
indirect taxes, the onerous regulations and restrictions imposed for the
convenience of collection, being perpetuated. The mere reduction of a
tax, when the state of the revenue admits of its entire abolition, is
hardly ever Edition: current; Page: [613] advisable; except for the
prevention of smuggling, or when the lower duty is expected to be as
productive as the higher. In the case of very few of the reductions was
either of these results anticipated; nor was there any ground for
anticipating them, nor any reason for reducing those particular taxes
rather than many others; nor was the reduction in almost any case
sufficient to make a perceptible difference in the yearly expenses of
the consumer. Perhaps, indeed, if a sensible relief had been afforded to
one portion of the dissatisfied, all the others would have been only the
louder in their complaints. But a firm Ministry, strong in the authority
of pure intentions and determination of purpose, could have overawed the
interested and the peevish: our Ministers can overawe nobody, because
they are afraid of everybody. These are the occasions which try the
quality of men. A weak man cannot even confer a benefit, without losing
more influence than he gains.

We are far from joining in the whole extent of the hostility entertained
by the shopkeepers of the large towns against the House Tax; which, if
impartially assessed, we incline to consider as one of the best of all
our imposts, having many of the recommendations of a Property Tax,
without its practical difficulties. Viewing it in this light, we should
be ready to give some credit to Lord Althorp for the steadiness with
which he has resisted the clamours of the representatives of the
ten-pound voters for the repeal of the House Tax, had he not, with
strange obtuseness, volunteered reiterated defences of those iniquitous
inequalities in the assessment, sparing the rich and pressing upon the
middle classes, which have disgusted the whole country, and mainly
contributed to raise a storm that will scarcely now be allayed but by
the destruction of that tax. It was coolly, gravely maintained, not by
way of a joke, nor with any apparent consciousness that the proposition
at all conflicted with the common sense and feeling of mankind—it was
laid down by Lord Althorp as the just principle of assessment for the
House Tax, that the overgrown houses of the very rich, which never can
be suitable habitations for any other than the proprietor, should be
taxed, not in the ratio of what the house, as a place to reside in,
costs to the owner, who actually dwells in it, but of the amount which
some other person, of far inferior income, could afford to pay for it as
a residence!15 A House Tax is defensible at all, only on the assumption
that what a person pays for his habitation is something approximating to
a test of his general means of expenditure. Let this test then be
applied. What the occupier of another man’s house pays for his
habitation, is the house-rent; but what the Marquis of Westminster pays
for Eaton Hall, is the interest of what it would cost to rebuild such a
mansion if it were destroyed.16 Were he to let it to Mr. Thompson or
Edition: current; Page: [614] Johnson, he might get only 300l. a-year
for it; but those 300l. are proportioned to the means of Mr. Thompson or
Johnson, and are the measure of what the tax-gatherer ought to demand
from him, not from the Marquis of Westminster. It is idle, however, to
prove what is self-evident.

Lord Althorp has done more to weaken himself and the Ministry, by
standing up night after night in the House of Commons as the vindicator
of this odious abuse, than they have done to strengthen themselves by
any, the most popular, measure of the Session.

But to return to their retrenchments. Cutting off useless expenditure is
always praiseworthy; and to the present Ministers it must in candour be
conceded that they have diminished some large salaries as well as small
ones, abolished some lucrative offices as well as insignificant ones.
Still, it is to be remarked that their large sum-total has been made up
by the addition of a great multitude of small savings; what have been
termed, by persons interested in disparaging them, savings of
cheese-parings and candle-ends: those reductions in the detail of the
expenditure, which we have again and again been solemnly assured had
been carried to the utmost extent possible, to an extent seriously
prejudicial to the conduct of public business. We see, however, that
when a real wish was entertained to make a still further reduction of
this minimum, the minimum was found to be a maximum. One fifth of the
actual expenses of governing the country, as this pamphleteer
triumphantly proclaims, cut off in three years!17 After several
retrenching ministries had done their worst—out of about fifteen
millions a saving of three millions in cheese-parings and candle-ends
alone! “Le mot impossible (said Napoleon) n’est pas Français.”18—Credit
after this who will, the impossibilities of heads of departments! But it
is true, nevertheless, that these three millions are made up of small
savings, and that the whole region of large ones is still untrodden. We
refer particularly to the diplomatic service, the army and navy, and the
colonies.

There are people who say, The diplomatic service is too expensive, it
has not yet been reduced, it will bear reduction. We say, the diplomatic
service ought to be abolished altogether. Consuls, at some places where
the laws of the foreign country are an insufficient protection, we can
discern a use for; and sometimes, but rarely, for an extraordinary
envoy: for a stationary ambassador, never. At the time when statesmen
could barely write their names, and when all business of importance was
transacted by word of mouth, there was meaning in ambassadors. But now,
when the art of written is so much more successfully cultivated than
that of spoken composition; when the communication between court and
court is as easy and safe, and almost as expeditious, as between any man
and his next-door neighbour; when between the ambassador himself and the
Edition: current; Page: [615] government to whom he is accredited, all
negociations are conducted by means of written documents—why should not
the writings pass between Governments themselves? What is the
ambassador, but a middleman uselessly interposed between principal and
principal? In the way of intelligence, again, what is there left to
communicate, in an age of universal publicity, in an age of daily
newspapers? Sufficient proof that there is nothing for an ambassador to
do, is the quality of the men who are set to do it. They are fit enough
for the purpose for which in reality they are kept up, viz. to give
dinners to our aristocracy when abroad, and to keep a table for their
idle younger sons in the character of attachés: but for what else?

Then the colonies: all which are worth keeping, all which for the good
of the colonies themselves ought to be kept, might be made to defray
their own expenses. Read Colonel Napier’s inestimable work on the Ionian
Islands, if you would learn how a distant dependency ought not, and also
how it ought, to be governed.19 When a colony cannot pay for its own
government, the reason generally is, first, because we insist upon
governing it as if it were an opulent nation: we carry out with us from
England as the mining associations did to Mexico, and with a similar
result, English ideas of efficiency, and English ideas of lavish
expense: not knowing, that to a rude state of society the simplest
machinery of government is best adapted, we must have the
establishments, the salaries, and even the pomps and fripperies, of an
old country. That is one cause. Another is, that we entrust the
governorship of the colony to one of the family of the Feebles, who
either employs his activity in doing mischief, or, by his indolence,
allows, that is, encourages others to do it: one who neither knows the
right time for spending money, nor the right time for saving it; one who
wastes the resources of the colony by mere mismanagement; who
alternately strains and relaxes the springs of government; every one of
whose blunders costs money to repair its consequences; and whose most
expensive blunder of all is his unpopularity. For all which, and much
else, see again Colonel Napier; whose book should be in the hands, not
only of every statesman and every public writer, but of every
Englishman.

If the colonies were made to pay their own expenses, economy in our
military establishment would be in a great measure accomplished; for the
far greater portion of our army is kept up for the service of our
colonies alone. By governing Ireland well, we might dispense with the
greater part of the remainder. What need has England of an army, except
one or two cavalry regiments, and the artillery? Can we ever be suddenly
involved in a continental war? And if we were, can we possibly maintain
such an army as would be a match, at the instant, for any one of the
continental powers? Then why attempt it?

Edition: current; Page: [616]
No nation which is not perpetually at war, can have a veteran army; but
to make the rawest new levies fight like lions, there is a sure
resource. Proclaim the system of the French army, promotion from the
ranks.20 Encourage the non-commissioned officers, even now confessedly
the main strength of our army, by the hope of commissions; let every man
of them know that if he have the soul of a Hoche, the fortune of a Hoche
is open to him.21 That would be the true substitute for flogging, and
for impressment too. Govern men by their hopes, and you need not by
their fears: let your generals rise from the ranks, and your admirals
from before the mast, and you need neither compel soldiers or sailors
into the service, nor treat them like slaves or brutish beasts when in
it; dismissal from it will be punishment enough. But neither from the
Whig nor from any other Ministers shall we obtain this, until the spirit
of aristocracy is completely purged out of our institutions. The
monopoly of the army and navy is the last monopoly which will be wrested
from the hands of the wealthy. There are many changes yet to come ere
that comes. It will be much, when we shall no longer, to provide for
gentlemen’s sons, keep up numerous admirals for every ship, numerous
generals for every regiment. It will be much, when we shall no longer,
to provide for gentlemen’s sons, make a retiring pension a perpetuity,
and maintain our Dead Weight scarcely diminished during eighteen years
of peace.22

Curious it is that the apologist of the Ministers reckons the Dead
Weight among the public charges not susceptible of reduction. He means
then, that officers not on the effective strength of the army, who have
not been once on full pay since the peace, who are supernumerary,
superfluous, and ought to have retained their half-pay on the footing
merely of a life pension, shall, when it would in a very few years have
lapsed by death, be allowed to sell their commission to a youth, who
steps into the place of an old man, and continues to receive the old
man’s retiring allowance after his death—a youth who will never be
wanted until the next war, if even then, and in the mean time is only
gathering seniority but not experience, eating his half-pay as the bread
of idleness,23 a mere liveried footman of the aristocracy. The Ministry
have appointed a Committee on Naval and Military Appointments, and the
Committee has not Edition: current; Page: [617] recommended the
abolition of this flagrant abuse.24 Ministers do not intend it, then;
but unless they correct their intention, their boast of being a Ministry
of retrenchment will deserve to count for very little.

Even in their own small way of clipping and paring the details of the
public expenses, much is still to be done which they seem to have no
thought of doing. To begin with themselves: of what earthly use is a
Lord Privy Seal?25 The utility of a President and a Vice-President of
the Board of Trade, or, indeed, of either of the two, is very
questionable. Why were the Duchy of Lancaster and the Duchy of Cornwall
excepted from the surrender of the hereditary revenues of the Crown?26
The expenditure of those duchies, being sheltered from any kind of
publicity, are, we may be sure, the last hiding place of every job too
openly disgraceful to be hazarded in the presence of the public. What
need of the expensive foppery of household troops? Why should the Guards
cost more than an equal number of other regiments? Economy has marched,
with pruning-knife in hand, along the grand avenues of the public
expenditure, but it has not yet peered into the bye-alleys. The harpies
of corruption, frightened out of the open daylight, will be found
skulking and cowering in the dark corners. Let Mr. Hume look narrowly
into those little modest items of the Miscellaneous Estimates, the
grants of 5000l. and 10,000l. under pretence of work to be done off the
common highways of public business and public view. The two words Record
Commission, alone speak volumes.27 The public eye has been let in,
perhaps, upon the most expensive jobs, but we much doubt whether it has
yet obtained a view of the most profligate ones.

We have demanded a large share of the reader’s indulgence; our excuse
must be, that we are reviewing not a pamphlet, but an administration. We
trust that all we shall at present deem it necessary to say, may be
brought to a conclusion in another article.28

218.: THE REVIEW OF THE SESSION CONTINUED
 EXAMINER, 6 OCT., 1833, PP. 625-6

For the entry in Mill’s bibliography and the context of this third
leading article on Le Marchant’s The Reform Ministry, see Nos. 216 and
217. In the Somerville College set of the Examiner, the article is
listed as title and enclosed in square brackets.

a few observations, which the length of our last article compelled us to
defer, are still required to bring to a close the subject of
retrenchment; after which we shall proceed to another department of the
doings of the Ministry.

One of the most important of the measures of economy which still remain
to be adopted, is an entire change in the constitution of the public
offices. Without such a change, the retrenchments for which Ministry
after Ministry have taken such unbounded credit, will cost to the public
much more money than they will save. Any fool can carry on the public
business cheaply and ill; but such cheap work is the dearest of all in
the end. Unlimited pecuniary means may be squandered; but of a limited
income every farthing must be turned to the best account. So long as the
number of employés could be made as great as the head of the department
felt an inclination to make it, the multitude of inefficient hands was a
source of useless expense, but they were like so many sinecures, the
most plain-dealing and cheapest of all jobs; if they did no good, they
prevented none; it was but so many people of “connexion,” quartered upon
the public instead of being kept by their “connexions,” or earning an
honest livelihood: the incapables consumed their salaries, and capable
officers were, or might have been, entertained in addition, to do the
work. But when the public will has enforced a reduction of the numerical
strength of an establishment to something not, perhaps, greatly
exceeding the number which would barely suffice if every man were fit
for his situation; from that time every inefficient man who is employed,
deprives the public of the services of an efficient one. Has due regard
been had to this principle in the reductions of the civil
establishments? Is it not a fact, that young men of family continue to
be engaged to do mere clerk’s work, but not at clerk’s salaries, and
that the money lavished upon them leaves so little for the wages of real
services, that the most valuable public officers are, not perhaps
underpaid, but so few in number and so overworked, that it is by no
means easy, when vacancies occur, to find fitting successors? If this be
not so, let it be denied; but if, as we firmly believe, it is so, let it
be remedied. There is no economy comparable to that of employing able
men. It is the accumulation of useless expenses which weighs down a
country; never the magnitude of the useful.

Above all, let the places of trust and power beyond the seas, where the
control of the superintending authority is weak, and the surveillance of
English public Edition: current; Page: [619] opinion is null—where the
wisdom, honesty, and firmness of the delegated functionary are all in
all—let those appointments, which are now, whether by Whig or Tory,
given to aristocratic or official connexion exclusively, be given solely
to merit; and, more scrupulously than even any other appointments, to
merit of the highest grade, no matter in what rank of life. An incapable
in high place is a more costly abuse than a hundred sinecures. Such a
one, governor of a colony, receives a salary of 5000l.; but his caprices
and his blunders, his self-conceit and his negligence, his want of
foresight, and of capacity to avail himself of opportunities, and make
the best use of his instruments, cost the nation forty or fifty
thousand. The pamphleteer says nothing for his patrons on this point. We
believe that they have followed the good old rule, of appointing, with a
very moderate degree of regard for personal qualifications, their
political friends.

Of retrenchment, and taking off taxes, no more at present. But there are
taxes, which are not called taxes, because not paid to the tax-gatherer,
but which are a subject for retrenchment, compared wherewith all that
can possibly be cut off from the expenses of government is hardly worth
notice; taxes the very existence of which is a crying enormity, and of
which the repeal would afford a relief nearly equal to the entire
interest of the national debt. Foremost among these is the odious Bread
Tax. If, as appears to be the opinion of the best authorities, wheat is
kept, by the operation of the Corn Laws, about 10s. a quarter above its
natural price; and if, as is commonly assumed, the inhabitants of the
United Kingdom, amounting to twenty millions, consume, one with another,
one quarter of wheat in the year; here is a tax of ten millions in the
article of wheat alone; to which when we add all other agricultural
produce, every other retrenchment sinks into insignificance, and the
word appears little better than a mockery when applied to anything
except getting rid of this intolerable burthen. There is in this kind of
retrenchment a further pre-eminence. Retrench by cutting down
establishments, and all the gain to the public is loss to the
functionaries who are discharged. Retrench by removing restrictions from
commerce and industry, and, by restoring capital to its natural
channels, an increase of production is created, which is a gain to the
public beyond and in addition to what individuals lose.

The Ministry, as a Ministry, profess themselves friends of free trade.
And here let us give “honour due” to one of their number, who has
entitled himself to a kind of praise, which can be given to no other
among them. Lord Palmerston, a short time before the prorogation of
Parliament, signalized himself by the only speech of principle which has
been made by any Minister during the Session; a speech which compromised
nothing, and went to the very vitals of the subject.1 Edition: current;
Page: [620] Lord Palmerston exposed the fallacies of protecting duties
and of reciprocity with the hand of one who really understood the
question, and without one vestige of Whig seesaw or reservation. But as
he speaks, so will his colleagues act? Some minor monopolies and
restrictions they have abolished or mitigated, and will, doubtless,
relieve us from others. But from the giant monopoly, compared with which
the heaviest of all our taxes is scarcely a burthen, it is not they who
will deliver us. They have put off the subject for one year, by moving
the previous question. Put it off much longer they cannot; certainly not
beyond the first deficient harvest; and the day when they must face this
great question will probably be the last of their administration. They
are not unanimous. Some of them are reputed enemies of the Bread Tax;
(Lord Ripon might have been deemed so, until he ate up his free-trade
principles, on Lord Fitzwilliam’s motion;)2 others (and the Premier is
of the number) are said to be among its most obstinate and bigoted
partisans. This is enough. A Minister who supports the Bread Tax, is
essentially neither a Reformer, nor an economical Minister: not the
last, because he seeks to rivet on our necks the heaviest and most
unprofitable burthen which the nation bears; not the first, because,
whether he is aware of it or not, the interest of the landlords is
paramount in his regard to the interest of all the rest of the
community. The distinction between such a statesman and a Tory lies
wholly in non-essentials; that between him and a Reformer is
fundamental.

The topic of Law Reform occupies a very prominent station in the
Ministerial pamphlet.3 On this subject more praise is really due to the
Ministry, or rather to the Chancellor, than can be given to any other of
their measures, except the Reform Bill. Though the substantial value of
what has yet been accomplished, is immensely overrated by their
panegyrist, the very fact of taking so much credit for law reform
deserves praise; and the more, because what can be said of none of their
other reforms, is true of this—that it was not forced upon them by the
public. Lord Brougham is not in this case a mere passive instrument, for
executing, and executing imperfectly, the peremptory mandates of popular
opinion. The public are as yet but moderately interested in the subject;
sufficiently to reward, yet not sufficiently to compel, the exertions of
the Chancellor. And the degree of excitement which does exist respecting
it, is mainly of his own creating. It is to those, indeed, who prepared
the way, by laying the foundation of the philosophy of law, and
dissecting piecemeal the absurdities of English practice; it is to those
who fought the up-hill fight, who originated Law Reform, and carried it
forward through every species of neglect, Edition: current; Page: [621]
discouragement, and insult, to the point at which even a man like Henry
Brougham could add to his reputation by adopting it, and making the
cause his own; it is to them, no doubt, that the gratitude of mankind is
chiefly due—not to him who came at the eleventh hour; yet neither to him
should praise be given with a reluctant or sparing hand. He was the
first public man who identified himself with the cause; the first who
popularized the idea, that the law needed reform as a whole. Mr. Peel’s
reforms had done much to discountenance the notion which strangely
prevailed, of the absolute perfection of the law even in its form and
details;4 and a notion was spreading that there was still considerable
room for minute improvements. But everything which has been done, or
attempted, in the way of reviewing the main body of the law—all idea,
among the public at large, of its being susceptible, as a whole, of any
considerable amelioration,—takes its date unquestionably from Mr.
Brougham’s celebrated speech:5 nor, at the time when that speech was
made, could any person of less weight than Mr. Brougham have pronounced
so bold and sweeping a condemnation of the English law (greatly as even
that condemnation fell short of its deserts) with much probability of
being favourably listened to. The first fruits of the speech were the
appointment of two Commissions, composed of lawyers of the first
eminence, whose inquiries and recommendations have done more to bring
Law Reform into vogue, and to liberalize the general feeling of the
profession, than could have been hoped for in so short a time.6
Piecemeal reforms have multiplied in an accelerating ratio ever since.
Some considerable changes, proposed by these Commissions, have been
carried through Parliament in the Session which has just closed;
together with others emanating directly from the Chancellor himself.7
And (a praise which the Ministers have seldom deserved) more has been
attempted, than could be effected at the first trial, and more has been
proclaimed desirable than has been attempted. Lord Brougham’s views of
Law Reform, if not always as enlightened, are now at length as
extensive, as the most philosophic reformer could desire. He has caused
codification to be recommended in a King’s speech:8 he has appointed a
Commission for making (though on a small scale, and beginning at the
wrong end) an actual commencement of it;9 and he has committed himself
irrevocably Edition: current; Page: [622] to the principle of Local
Courts.10 These things, if accomplished, are the greater part of all
which is to be desired. Codify the law, common and statute together, and
establish Local Courts with unlimited jurisdiction, and all that will
remain to complete a systematic reform of the law, is to simplify the
procedure, and establish good courts of appeal.

Lord Brougham’s Law Reforms will be the leading subject of our next
Paper.


219.: LORD BROUGHAM’S LAW REFORMS
 EXAMINER, 13 OCT., 1833, PP. 643-4

This is the fourth of Mill’s leading articles on the parliamentary
session of 1833 prompted by Le Marchant’s The Reform Ministry; see Nos.
216-18. In addition to those specifically mentioned in the text,
Brougham’s Law Reforms include 2 William IV, cc. 34, 39 (1832); 2 & 3
William IV, cc. 51, 62, 116, 123 (1832); and 3 & 4 William IV, cc. 44,
67 (1833). For the context and bibliographic entry see No. 216. In the
Somerville College set of the Examiner, the article is listed as title
and enclosed in square brackets.

if the remarks by which we are about to qualify our applause of Lord
Brougham’s Law Reforms should seem of a disparaging tendency, they are
inspired by no love of disparagement, but by the conviction that there
is no greater enemy of the good which is to come, than exaggerated
praise of the good which has already been effected. Lord Brougham’s
vocation is that of a popular orator rather than a legislator. The
service which beyond all other men of his day he was fitted to render to
Law Reform, was that of discrediting the existing system. This he has
done, and is doing, as effectually perhaps as it could have been done by
a mind of more philosophic habits and of more enlarged views. He is
great as a destroyer; not great as a rebuilder. All that he has
overthrown well deserved to fall; nothing that he has established, in
the opinion of the most thorough law reformers in the profession,
deserves to stand. Not only his reforms are partial and narrow, but they
are such as cannot fit into any more comprehensive plan of reform. A
great edifice cannot be built in a day; but his hasty erections will
form no part of the building when it is completed; they are mere
temporary sheds, occupying part of the ground—an actual obstruction in
the way of the workmen, though a far less one than the cumbrous ruin
which was cleared away to make room for them.

The old Bankruptcy Court was an abomination;1 the judicial arrangements
relating to the affairs of lunatics were a mass of expensive absurdity;2
there could Edition: current; Page: [623] not be a worse constituted
tribunal than the Privy Council, the sole court of appeal from the
tribunals of the colonies;3 the Ecclesiastical Courts deserve to be
swept away.4 But does any man, capable of forming the conception of a
rational judicial establishment, believe that there will much longer be
a court for bankruptcy alone, a court for lunacy alone, a court only for
marriage causes and for proving wills, a court only to hear appeals from
the colonies? Certainly not: and in the mean time all these new
judgeships and commissionerships are so many vested interests, which,
when the time comes, the public will be expected to buy off. All these
nibbling reforms in Chancery, again, what are they? when every
enlightened law reformer is convinced that the Court of Chancery as a
separate Court must cease to exist, and that the same judges in the
first instance, and the same judges of appeal, will ultimately
administer both that part of the law which is called Law, and that other
part of the law which is called Equity?

Of the defects in the details of Lord Brougham’s reforms, and of his
views of reform, we can only select, nearly at random, a few instances
as specimens.

He has abolished prospectively many legal sinecures, which yielded
immense incomes to sons, nephews, and grandchildren of Chancellors and
Judges, at the expense of suitors.5 Of the golden streams which flowed
into the strong boxes of these lucky foster-children of the nation, a
part, indeed, have been dammed up, but the remainder only diverted into
the Exchequer of the State.6 Of the fees which unfortunate applicants
for justice were forced to pay, avowedly for no purpose but to make an
income for these sinecure placemen, a part only have been remitted; a
part continue to be collected for the benefit of the public revenue! The
most odious of all taxes—taxes on justice—abolished in 1823 by Lord
Liverpool’s Ministry7—behold them re-established by the Reform Ministry!
It was reserved for the Reform Ministry, and for the man who desires to
go down to posterity as the reformer of the laws of England, to re-enact
an abuse so odious, that it was abolished even by Tories, in the very
first hour in which the words law reform were uttered in a public place.
Once more it has been decided, that a man is to be selected as a fit
object of taxation because he is suffering evil—that because he is put
to immense expense by having had his rights disputed, or a wrong
inflicted upon him, therefore he shall be put to further Edition:
current; Page: [624] expense for the general purposes of the State—that
because the King, and the Ministers, and the army, and the navy, and the
courts of justice, having succeeded in protecting the rest of the
community from injustice, have failed in protecting him, therefore he
shall be picked out from the rest of the community as the person who
shall be required to pay more money for the support of those
establishments! And the Solicitor-General, Sir John Campbell, a man whom
we regret to blame, for no person connected with the Government oftener
gives utterance to sentiments deserving of praise, actually
congratulated the Chancellor of the Exchequer on this accession to his
financial resources.8 A few thousands a-year, wrung from the needy and
from the injured—a noble subject of congratulation!

In a matter nearly connected with this, the House of Commons proved
themselves better law reformers than Lord Brougham. The principle of
remunerating judicial officers by fees instead of salaries, at the
expense of suitors instead of the State, that is, at the expense of
those who derive less benefit than any one else from the administration
of justice, being put to trouble and expense for that protection which
others obtain gratuitously; this pernicious principle, discarded by Lord
Brougham in a great variety of cases, had been most inconsistently
retained in others: but the House of Commons, in passing the Chancery
Reform Bill, extirpated that mischief from it altogether.9 This roused
the Chancellor; who, when the Bill returned to the House of Lords,
entered into a vindication of his own views. He said, that unless the
officers of the court were paid by fees, their reward would not be in
proportion to their exertions, and they would have motives to retard
instead of accelerating the despatch of business.10 Extraordinary as it
may seem, in this doctrine the Chancellor was perfectly serious, and, we
are persuaded, sincere. All it proves is, on how slender a foundation of
principle his opinions rest, and with how little of reflection they are
taken up. Strange not to see that this reason for payment by fees
instead of salary, is applicable to all public officers whatever, if to
any: still more strange not to see that a superior functionary
stultifies himself, when he professes incapability of compelling his
subordinates to do their duty, unless they are bribed to do it by the
very person who least of all others in the community ought to bear that
extra burthen. Formerly almost all public officers were paid by fees:
the iniquity of the principle, and the abuses to which it was liable in
practice, have caused payment Edition: current; Page: [625] by salaries
to be almost universally substituted; and now what is it which keeps
public functionaries to their duty? The good sense and vigilance of
their official superiors: and is the Chancellor incapable of exercising
similar vigilance? Say that it is necessary that his subordinates should
have the additional inducement of a pecuniary remuneration proportional
to the quantity of the work, (even if at the expense of the quality,)
are there no means devisable by human ingenuity for giving them that
pecuniary inducement, except out of the pockets of injured men
petitioning for justice? When nobody but the public is interested in
getting over a difficulty, the easiest effort of thought seems to be
grudged for finding a solution. Not that the public good is not dear to
these men, but that their zeal for it is a capricious and wavering, not
a steady principle of action.

Though the Chancellor defended the principle of remuneration by fees, he
did, we believe, throw out something like a condemnation of making those
fees contingent upon any incident which the officer receiving the fees
has the power of multiplying, for the purpose of increasing his own
emoluments. But so completely are the acts of the Chancellor at issue
with his professions, that the particular fees which the officers who
profit by them have the greatest power of multiplying the occasions for,
(and have exercised that power to the most mischievous extent,) those
very fees, both in the Court of Chancery and in the Courts of Common
Law, instead of abolishing, or diverting into other channels, the
Chancellor has largely increased. We do not believe that this was done
with evil consciousness for jobbing purposes. But is it at all wonderful
that there should be thousands who do think so?

We are compelled to select as examples of the Chancellor’s defective
notions of legislation, not the most important instances, but those
which can be exhibited at least length. We will mention one which is
striking, and will occupy little space. Even the unprofessional reader
knows that lawsuits are often decided by arbitration, and that after the
parties have incurred nearly the whole expense of a suit, the judge
frequently advises them to refer the case to a gentleman of the bar; but
they do so at their option, and not otherwise. One of Lord Brougham’s
Bills contained a clause, which was struck out of the particular Bill,
but afterwards revived, and which we understand is still persevered in,
empowering the judge at his discretion to nominate an arbitrator, and
rendering the decision of the arbitrator so designated compulsory on the
parties.11 Now observe the character of this proceeding, and of the
process of thought in the Chancellor’s mind, on Edition: current; Page:
[626] which it must have been founded. All the presumptions are against
arbitration, as compared with a suit in the courts. The arbitrator is
wholly irresponsible, even to the opinion of the world; he decides
without publicity, and decides upon evidence taken without publicity: he
is a person selected almost at hazard, hardly ever of any professional
eminence, certainly of less than the judge who selects him, unless the
appointment of the judge amounted to an act of the grossest public
profligacy. Nevertheless, although there are all these strong
presumptions against decision by an arbitrator, the voluntary agreement
of the parties to submit to it in preference to the regular tribunal, is
a presumption in its favour stronger than these, and outweighing them.
Therefore the parties shall be compelled to choose it whether they will
or no!

If the law reforms of the Chancellor were analysed in detail, we should
be able to exhibit innumerable specimens of loose and imperfect
thinking, not inferior to these. We have not room for that minute
examination here. But we must notice something of more serious moment,
because on a larger scale; what we hold to be an error of principle of
the very first magnitude. The whole of the Chancellor’s notions on the
subject of appeal, the very key-stone of a good system of judicature,
appear to us to be radically erroneous, and all that he is doing or
planning with relation to it, to be fundamentally wrong. If there is one
principle more than another, which is universal and paramount in public
business of almost any kind, but above all in judicature, it is that the
functionary should be one. Not indeed where the law is doubtful; for
then the question should be referred to the collective body of the
highest legal authorities, as now to the fifteen judges, not so much for
greater certainty, as to ensure uniformity in the law. But in all other
cases, to set three or four judges on a bench to hear one cause, is not
only paying three or four persons to do the work of one, but it renders
absolutely certain their doing it ill. One judge feels the public eye
upon him; he is ashamed to be corrupt, or partial, or inattentive; but
when there are several, each dares perpetrate under the sanction of the
others, wickedness the undivided obloquy of which he would have shrunk
from; each trusts that others have been listening though he has not,
that others have given their minds to the cause though he has not; and
instead of the services of several judges, the public has something
considerably less than the best services of one.

But Lord Brougham carried the prejudices of a Common Lawyer into a Court
of Equity, and resolved to assimilate the two, by altering the practice
not where it was bad but where it was good. Hitherto in the Court of
Chancery the appeal has been from one judge to one judge: when the
proposed Bill shall have passed, it will be from one judge to three.12 A
similar change has been effected in the Privy Edition: current; Page:
[627] Council.13 And this the ministerial pamphleteer lauds as a most
glorious improvement. “It must be admitted that a single judge hearing
and deciding on questions of great moment was not a very good specimen
of a court of appeal.”14

One ridiculous effect of this so-called reform, which does not appear to
be at all thought of, is the following: at present three judges in the
first resort sit regularly for the dispatch of business, and one only is
ever occupied in hearing appeals from them: but now every appeal will
take up the time of three, leaving only one to judge in the first
instance. We may look forward therefore to an immense and rapidly
accumulating arrear, or to the speedy appointment of several more judges
in equity.

We shall only further mention, under the title of Law Reform, two
instances of discreditable truckling which we really hope not to see
renewed. When the House of Lords was about to reject the Local Courts’
Bill, which had already been mulcted of almost all that was valuable in
it except the principle, in order to have a chance of passing, (the
jurisdiction, originally of 100l., having been reduced to 20l.)15 what
said the Chancellor?—That if, by rejecting a bill, the utility of which
had been pared down almost to a minimum, they proved that no measure for
really improving the judicature of the country had any chance of finding
acceptance with them, he would give over compromising, and making his
measures petty and contemptible to please them, and would propose a
large measure containing all that the public welfare imperiously
required, leaving them to reject it at their peril?—Nothing of the kind.
He told them that if they threw out the Bill they should not daunt him,
nor turn him back in the career of Law Reform, and that he would next
time present to them a Bill—far less extensive than the preceding!16
This was tantamount to actually inviting their rejection of the Bill,
and promising to do all he could to cover over and shelter the iniquity
of their conduct. Let us hope that his acts, in this instance, will be
better than his words.

This was truckling to the House of Lords. Their leaving the Registration
Bill, the only really important measure which has emanated from the Real
Property Edition: current; Page: [628] Commission, in private hands,17
while all the other Bills of that Commission were adopted as Government
measures, this was truckling to the House of Commons. And a notable
specimen was the rejection of that Bill, of what that House is—of what
are the interests which still predominate there. Still the House of
Landlords; still the House of Insolvent Debtors; and when strong public
clamour does not compel some regard to the public interest, still as
stupidly and as blindly selfish as in the worst times. Every man who
voted for throwing out the Registry Bill, stamped himself thereby as a
man more deeply in debt that he dared to avow. Not only was there no
good motive, there was no other motive, good or bad, which could render
a landowner averse to the official authentication of his property, and
the claims on it, in the same manner in which his father’s will is
authenticated by registry in Doctors’ Commons.


220.: THE CORPORATION BILL
 EXAMINER, 20 OCT., 1833, PP. 659-60

This article discusses a plan for municipal corporations outlined by
Brougham late in the session in a speech of 22 Aug., 1833 (PD, 3rd ser.,
Vol. 20, cols. 821-4); the plan did not result in legislation until
1835. It is Mill’s fifth leading article on the parliamentary session of
1833, prompted by Le Marchant’s The Reform Ministry; for the entry in
Mill’s bibliography and the context, see Nos. 216-19. Unlike the
previous articles in the series, this and No. 221 are signed “A.B.,”
Mill’s most common form in these years. In the Somerville College set of
the Examiner, it is listed as title and enclosed in square brackets.

the measure which Lord Brougham has introduced for giving municipal
constitutions to the new boroughs, is far from an advantageous sample of
his talents for legislation.

The elements of a local constitution for the management of the affairs
of a town, are obvious enough to common sense. They are, first, a
municipal assembly, or sub-legislature, elected by popular suffrage, to
enact local regulations, levy local taxes, and direct their application
to local purposes. Secondly, a superintendant of police, with a
sufficient number of policemen for watch and ward. Thirdly, one or more
local judges, who should be magistrates as well as judges; for it
requires the very same order of judicial ability to determine whether
there is evidence sufficient for commitment, as to decide subsequently
whether there is sufficient for conviction. These judges, like all other
judges, Edition: current; Page: [629] should not be elected by the
people: a multitudinous body is not qualified to select, previous to
trial, the fittest among several candidates, for the delicate and
arduous functions of a judge. That most difficult and perilous choice
can only be made by an officer of great skill and experience, especially
appointed to that duty: an officer who, in almost all civilized
countries except this, is a member of the Cabinet, under the title of
Minister of Justice. But in order to give to the people the necessary
security against bad appointments, (the control of Parliament, even if
Parliament were other than it is, never could be exerted but in extreme
cases,) the local judge ought to be removable by the people of the
district, either directly, or through their representatives, the
municipal council, not only for malversation, but unfitness of any kind.

The Chancellor having to frame a new municipal constitution, what does
he? Place before himself the ends to be attained, and look out for the
simplest and straightest means by which to reach them? No; he never
applies the force of his intellect to the matter at all; never, it is
obvious, puts the subject distinctly before his own mind. But he turns,
perhaps, to the most philosophical writers on the subject, and takes
their views for the guidance of his own. Just as little. What then does
he? Servilely copies the constitution of the Corporation of London:
instead of thought, contents himself with mere mimicry. The city of
London has a common council and aldermen; therefore the new Corporations
must also have a common council and aldermen! Not even tact enough to
change the names; names so loaded with associations of vulgarity and
imbecility, that, as a correspondent of the Times well remarked, nothing
more than that one circumstance is wanted to prevent persons of
education and refinement from seeking or accepting the office.1 But
aldermen!—why aldermen? This from the author and enthusiastic promoter
of the Local Courts’ Bill!2 what need of aldermen when we have Local
Courts? and if we have them not yet, shall we not have them next year,
or at farthest the year after? Why not insert them in this very Bill?
Why build up, what we must immediately pull down? Aldermen! Have we not
had a long enough trial of unpaid judicature? of amateur judges, whose
first business is their shop, and the bench only their second? If there
is an occupation upon the earth which requires the devotion of the
entire faculties, it is the function of judicature; and men who would
not allow their clerks or their footmen to have any second employment,
will allow their judges to make judging the mere délassement of their
leisure hours. But so it was in the old Corporations; so, therefore, the
reformer of our laws wills that it shall be in the new.

Nevertheless, the anti-popular instinct has guided him most surely to
the abridging of whatever privileges the old constitution conferred upon
the Edition: current; Page: [630] democracy. For annual, he has
substituted triennial elections;3 and the aldermen are not to be elected
by the inhabitants at all. In the latter of these two points we think
him right by accident; but not in the mode of nomination which he has
instituted. The aldermen are to be elected by the common council: and
(to put the comble to all the rest) they are to be elected by the common
council from their own body.4 And mark this: the whole magistracy of
each of the new boroughs will have to be selected for life from among
the few persons who will be chosen the first time to form the common
council.5 We stand appalled at the bare imagination of the jobbing, the
intriguing, the backbiting, the undermining, the low tricks of all
sorts, and the ill blood that will spring out of the contest, first to
be elected into these primitive common councils, and afterwards to be
elected by them. What a scheme for starting the new municipal
constitution—for giving it that prosperous commencement which is of such
inestimable importance to all new institutions, and the want of which it
takes so many years to repair! But this is the smallest part of the evil
of the absurdity. No qualifications whatever being required, apparently,
to make a good judicial officer, anybody, who is not absolutely unfit
for anything, being supposed to be fit for a magistrate; the choosers of
aldermen are to be limited in their choice to the few persons whom the
people have selected for a quite other sort of function: just as if the
fifteen judges were required to be selected from the House of Commons.
Because a man has been deemed fit for vestry business, he is fit to
decide the most delicate question of evidence affecting the liberties
and fortunes of the people!

This is instructive in more ways than one: it is a specimen which brings
strongly into view (what are almost always equally mischievous, but
seldom so ridiculous) the consequences of halting between two roads, and
not choosing between two principles, but taking half of one and half of
another. The Chancellor had renounced the principle of popular election
of aldermen; he was alarmed at his own audacity; and we are persuaded,
he flattered himself that by requiring those functionaries to be
selected from a body which already emanated from popular election, he
should still give something of a democratic air to his measure, and ward
off a part of the disapprobation which might otherwise fall upon the
curtailment of popular privileges. He will fail in this, as all such
truckling policy deserves to fail; he will succeed only in ruining the
utility of his own measure.

While in these particulars the Chancellor has deviated from the
constitution of the city of London, only that the new machinery might be
worse than even the old, he has faithfully imitated the most defective
parts of his worm-eaten model. Think of proposing aldermen for life! The
proposition has excited so universal a Edition: current; Page: [631]
shout of condemnation,6 that to expend any more words in the exposure of
it would be superfluous.

The appointment of a Commission to inquire into the abuses of Municipal
Corporations was commendable.7 Not that, in any enlarged view there was
the least necessity for such an inquiry; it is sufficiently notorious
what the corporations are. There is not a man in England, not imbecile,
or the rankest of Tories, who would not vote for making maison nette of
all the existing filth, and giving the same constitution to the old
boroughs at once which ought to be given to the new. The proper
municipal constitution for an English town is a question of general
legislative policy; not of judicial investigation. However, although the
public are completely convinced, they are not yet sufficiently strongly
moved; and without the publicity which will now be given to the details
of the abominations of the existing town-governments, the disgust of the
public would perhaps not yet have been roused to declare itself with the
energy, without which no triumph is ever achieved over the hosts of
interested enemies fighting as for their daily bread.

Many of the names of those who compose the Municipal Commission, are
guarantees to the public that its duties will be performed with honesty
and vigour. Indeed, there are few things in which the conduct of
Ministers has, on the whole, been more unexceptionable than in the
appointment of Commissions. We could find something to criticize there
too, if we were disposed; but Ministers have been the subjects of so
much vulgar abuse precisely where they have least merited it, that we
prefer the more grateful office of defence. Never, surely, was there a
more absurd reproach than that of “governing the country by means of
Commissions.”8 Their Commissions have been so much more efficient than
themselves, that we heartily wish the reproach were well-founded. If the
Commissioners are fit to govern the country, where would be the great
evil if they did govern? We should then, for the first time in this
island, have our affairs managed by persons chosen, because they were
believed to be fit for their work, not because they were lords, or had a
“stake in the country,”9 or on any other such despicable ground of
recommendation.

We have not quite come to it yet; but there will soon be a time, it will
probably Edition: current; Page: [632] be but a short one, during which
the country will actually be governed in the manner alleged; that is,
all the more important and difficult public business will be carried on
by Commissions, or other unacknowledged and comparatively unresponsible
subordinates: and this, though but a transition to a more natural state
of things, (in which the same men will do the work and gain the credit,)
will even in itself be a far better state than that which now exists.
But a change which really constitutes a great step in advance often
looks so absurd and incongruous on the face of it, that people give it
all sorts of bad names.

Thus, for example, when the five great Powers of Europe commanded
Belgium and Holland to lay down their arms, and because one of them
refused, instead of leaving them to fight out their quarrel in the
old-fashioned way, commanded the other party to hold its peace, and took
the chastisement of its more obstinate antagonist into their own hands;
some people laughed, and others were angry, and exclaimed, Why interfere
at all? And, assuredly, the exhibition, if looked at simply in itself,
was grotesque enough: but if, on the other hand, we view it as what it
really is, a proof of universal anxiety for the preservation of peace,
founded indeed on no philanthropy, solely on a sense of interest, but
yet so eager and earnest, even in the worst governments of Europe, that
instead of coming to blows immediately, as they were wont to do, upon
the slightest quarrel, they will not even suffer the most insignificant
of their neighbours to go to war, lest the conflagration should spread
to them; we then behold in what seemed absurd at first, no less than the
commencement of a federative system of police for the European
commonwealth: a commencement imperfect and barbarous enough, but such as
all government was in its first beginnings. We recognize the same
interests at work in the community of nations, which elevated the
separate communities of men from a state of nature to a state of
peaceful society. We see in the London Conference the first small germ
of an international tribunal, an arbiter established by common consent
to adjust the quarrels of nations by other means than a recourse to the
sword; and what seemed a mere accidental variety of folly, brought about
by the temporizing policy of a few individuals, becomes a sign and
precursor of a great advancement in civilization, gradually, but surely
preparing.*

Edition: current; Page: [633]
A change in progress, of a similar but a still more far-reaching kind,
seems to us to be indicated by many symptoms, among which none is more
significant than what has been sarcastically called “government by
commissions.” We are gradually emerging from a dark period in which
mental capacity (with a few exceptions which, when correctly analysed,
are scarcely exceptions) was not regarded at all, as a criterion of
fitness for high station and power. We are about to enter into a period
in which capacity, or the reputation of capacity, will be the sole
criterion. In the interval of transition there occurs a particular
moment when the Incapables, those who occupy the high places solely on
account of their riches or their connexions, are not yet dislodged from
their seats, but in which public opinion and the growing difficulty of
the times render it necessary that the work should be done better than
the Incapables can do it. When this happens the matter is temporarily
accommodated in this way: the Incapables retain the offices; but capable
men are associated with them for the purpose of relieving them from the
more arduous of the duties: and the appurtenances of office are shared
between the parties in this way; the Incapable takes all the dignity and
the greater part of the emoluments; his capable subordinate receives the
minimum of pay and does the work. We are now in the beginnings, the
first small beginnings, of this transition.

What is to be lamented is, not that the Ministers have had good sense
and honesty sufficient to seek and find men fit to do those things for
which they themselves are unfit; but that the fittest men are not
themselves Ministers, or Ministers the fittest men. Not being so, they
deserve the more praise for finding others who are fitter and trusting
to them: would they had deserved it more! we should not then have had
inflicted on us a series of legislative crudities, enough to make the
very idea of altering any of our institutions almost alarming, and to
make even earnest reformers occasionally wish that the attempt could
have been deferred until better heads could have been found for planning
and better hands for executing it.

Commissions are appointed to investigate all sorts of subjects; and when
a commission has thrown every imaginable light upon a subject, has made
its principles so intelligible and conspicuous that ingenuity itself can
scarcely find a word additional to say in illustration; then the
Ministers rush in and legislate in ignorance or disregard of all that
the commission recommends and of all the evidence which it has
collected. Something of this sort, not certainly in so great a degree,
happened in the instance of the Factory Bill; a measure which, but for
the Edition: current; Page: [634] alterations suggested by the Factory
Commission, never could have been executed, and would have been most
mischievous if it could. Ministers did adhere to the salutary
recommendations of the commission in respect to infant labour: but made
numerous alterations directly in the teeth of those recommendations;
and, in particular, contrary to all sound principles of legislation and
without the shadow of a case made out in justification, consented to
impose restrictions on the hours of labour of certain classes of
adults.10

This was done to gain votes and appease a popular clamour. But something
far worse in its tendencies, and which indicates a far more serious and
deeper-seated defect in the minds of the men themselves, was the support
which some of the principal of them gave to the Labour Rate Bill.11 Of
all which they have done, this is to our minds the most decisive of
their unfitness for the higher duties of government, and has the most
completely divested us of all expectation or even hope of further
considerable good from their hands. For in no other case have they
sinned so flagrantly, we will not say against knowledge, but against the
amplest opportunities of knowledge. In no other case had equal pains
been taken to place the subject before them in the proper light. In no
other case, if they had been capable of understanding the question,
could they have attained to the understanding of it with so little
trouble. And in no case perhaps has their absolute want of the very
first elements of a knowledge of the subject been so lamentably
conspicuous.

221.: CONDUCT OF THE MINISTRY WITH RESPECT TO THE POOR LAWS
 EXAMINER, 27 OCT., 1833, PP. 675-6

This is the sixth of Mill’s leading articles on the parliamentary
session of 1833 prompted by Le Marchant’s The Reform Ministry; for the
entry in his bibliography and the context, see Nos. 216-20. In the
Somerville College set of the Examiner, it is listed as title and
enclosed in square brackets.

who has not read the volume of Selections from the Evidence collected by
the Edition: current; Page: [635] Poor Laws Commissioners?1 Such a body
of documents on the condition of the working people of any country
never, probably, were brought together. It might be termed, “The Theory
and Practice of Pauperism.” It is there we may learn what pauperism is;
it is there, too, that we learn by what successive stages the labouring
agricultural population of the greater part of England has been
pauperized: sunk from the condition and feelings of independent
labourers subsisting upon the earnings of their own labour, to the state
of mind of reckless sinecurists, whose grand object is to be supported
in comfort for doing nothing, and rapidly passing even from that state
into the still worse—of extorting the payment they deem adequate to
their wants, by riots and nightly incendiarism. This deplorable
degeneracy has not arisen from the legitimate application of the
original principle of the Poor Laws, that of giving food to those who
can work, only in exchange for labour, within the walls of a workhouse.
It has sprung from the gradual creeping-in of a series of illegal
practices, by which wages have ceased altogether to be the reward of
labour;—those who will, and those who will not work; those who have
large families and those who have none; those who can obtain employment
and those whom, on account of their bad character, no one will employ,
being placed exactly on a par; except, indeed, the man who has saved
something—he alone is prevented from obtaining employment till it is all
spent.

Foremost, and worst among the contrivances by which all this mischief
has been effected, is the system of roundsmen, or, as it is otherwise
called, Labour Rate. By this plan all the labourers who have settlements
in a parish are parcelled out among the rate-payers of the parish, each
being required to employ, and pay at a certain rate, a certain number of
labourers, (fixed by the vestry,) whether he has occasion for their
labour or no! This is a trick to enable the farmers to throw an undue
share of the burden of supporting the surplus population upon the
shopkeepers and other inhabitants of the parish. Its most striking
effect is, that it pauperizes at one stroke all the labourers of a
parish. As the Commissioners say,

Under the Labour Rate system relief and wages are utterly confounded.
All the wages partake of relief, and all the relief partakes of wages.
The labourer is employed, not because he is a good workman, but because
he is a parishioner. He receives a certain sum, not because that sum is
the value of his services, but because it is what the vestry has ordered
to be paid. Good conduct, diligence, skill, all become valueless.2

Another effect is, that by compelling the parishioners to employ all
their own poor, however idle and inefficient, this system forces them to
cease employing those who have settlements elsewhere; who, consequently
are thrown back upon Edition: current; Page: [636] their own parishes;
where, if there is no employment for them, they, too, from being
industrious and independent labourers, sink into paupers.

While the country is resounding with these lamentable facts, elicited by
the inquiries of the Poor Laws Commission, and published by authority, a
Cabinet Minister introduces a Bill into the House of Lords for
legalizing and extending the system of Labour Rates.3 Lord Althorp
requests the opinion of the Commissioners on this precious Bill;
unnecessarily enough, but in order to leave his own ignorance still more
utterly without excuse.4 The Commissioners write to him in reply a most
unanswerable letter, (it is printed among the Parliamentary Papers of
the Session,) condemning the Bill utterly, and stating its inherent and
irremediable vices most lucidly and cogently. One of the Commissioners
delivered an able speech against the Bill from his place in the House of
Lords.5 Nevertheless, the Bill, introduced by one Cabinet Minister,
supported by another,6 and opposed by none, passes the House of Lords,
and is sent down to the Commons. Arrived there, it is supported by Lord
Althorp;7 and, but for the radical Members, who, headed by Mr. Charles
Buller,8 mustered to speak and vote against it, (and with whom Mr.
Poulett Thomson and the Solicitor-General, to their infinite credit,
warmly co-operated,)9 the Bill would have become law!

If anything could be more discreditable than the conduct of Lords
Lansdowne and Althorp on this measure, it would be the reasons they gave
for it. The Bill, they allowed, would be exceptionable as a permanent
measure, but good as a “temporary palliative,”10 until something more
effectual could be done. It is scarcely credible, that after all which
had been written on the subject by the Commissioners, these Ministers
could have remained in such a state of complete ignorance of the very
first rudiments of the subject as this implies. As well might they
propose, that when a fire breaks out, as the fire-engine is a long way
off, the Edition: current; Page: [637] interval till it arrives should
be employed in throwing on, as a temporary palliative, all the oil that
can be procured. In the very letter which Lord Althorp solicited and
obtained from the Commissioners, they had urged with irresistible force,
as the crowning evil of the Labour Rate system,

the great additional difficulty which it will create in the already
arduous task of Poor Law amendment. When the direct employers of labour
for some time have extorted from others the payment of a still greater
part of the wages of their labourers, when the best class of labourers,
those who are not settled in the place of their employment, have
disappeared; when what now remains of repugnance to relief, or of
degradation in accepting it, has been destroyed by its being merged in
wages; when all the labourers have been converted into a semi-servile
populace, ascripti glebae, without fear, but without hope—where (ask the
Commissioners,) can we look for the materials of improvement?11

These poor Lords, precisely as they took the word of the licensing
magistrates for the horrible effects of the beer-shops,12 took, in like
manner, the words of the country gentlemen, and of their agricultural
colleague, the Duke of Richmond, for the “palliative” tendency of the
Labour Rate Bill, because it would have “palliated” the immediate burden
of poor-rate upon the farmers; that is, upon the landlords. And neither
of the two dupes was capable, we do not say of finding out by their own
native faculties, but even of understanding after it had been clearly
pointed out—that if a Labour Rate alleviated the pressure upon one
portion of the rate-payers, it could not do so but by laying an exactly
equivalent burden upon another portion; and if it could, what then?
There is not one of the abuses of the Poor Laws but was originally
introduced for the sake of lowering the rate, and did, at first,
actually have that effect. Too great eagerness to lower the rate by
“temporary palliatives,” has brought us into our present state; a state
from which, instead of being extricated, we shall sink deeper into the
vortex every year, till society itself is swallowed up, unless the evil
is met and combated by means in every respect the reverse of those
contemplated by the authors and promoters of the Labour Rate Bill.

The Ministerial pamphleteer sounds a loud note of preparation for Poor
Law Reforms;13 and before the introduction of this Bill we had really
entertained hopes, that with such advisers as the Commissioners,
Ministers, without touching the principle of the Poor Laws, (of which we
approve,) would contrive, if not a radical reform, at least the means of
a considerable improvement of their Edition: current; Page: [638]
administration. Now, it will be our good fortune rather than their
merit, if instead of amendment, we do not obtain something which will
render all the abuses ten times worse. Men who could not be taught by
their own Commissioners to understand the elements of a single branch of
the question, will make a hopeful figure in dealing with the general
problem of Poor Law amendment!

There is no soundness in their understandings, no power of fathoming a
subject even of not extraordinary depth. The person who talks loudest
and longest to them carries them along with him; nor have they even the
ordinary good sense to distrust suggestions which come from an
interested quarter.

222.: MARTINEAU’S A TALE OF THE TYNE
 EXAMINER, 27 OCT., 1833, PP. 677-8

Writing to Carlyle on 25 Nov., 1833, a week after his return from Paris,
Mill asks: “did you detect me in the Exr reviewing Miss Martineau, &
Col. Napier?” (EL, CW, Vol. XII, p. 197). And, again to Carlyle on 12
Jan., 1834: “The paper on Miss Martineau was really a paper on
Impressment” (ibid., p. 209). For earlier reference to her
Illustrations, see No. 197. This review, in the “Literary Examiner,” is
headed “Illustrations of Political Economy. No. 21. A Tale of the Tyne.
By Harriet Martineau. [London:] C. Fox [1833].” Described in Mill’s
bibliography as “A review of Miss Martineau’s ‘Tale of the Tyne’ in the
Examiner of 27th October 1833” (MacMinn, p. 35), this article is listed
in the Somerville College set of the Examiner as “Review of Miss
Martineau’s ‘Tale of the Tyne’ ” and enclosed in square brackets. Mill
quoted part of this article in his “Notes on the Newspapers” in the
Monthly Repository for April 1834 (see CW, Vol. VI, pp. 178-9); in the
variant notes “34” indicates Monthly Repository, 1834.

if, as we think must be admitted, some of the more recent tales of this
series (though none are deficient in passages of great beauty and power)
have not kept up to the high level of the earlier numbers, the
illustration of impressment came in time to prove that the inferiority
arises from no decline of the author’s talents, nor exhaustion of her
vein, but from the more ungrateful nature of some of the topics on which
she has recently been engaged. All the truths of her science do not
equally admit of being illustrated by a succession of interesting
incidents, and she has sometimes, instead of working the principle into
the body of her tale, found herself thrown upon the last resource of
foisting it in under cover of scientific conversations between her
principal characters.

In the present instance, however, her subject was eminently susceptible
of striking illustration and powerful enforcement through the medium of
a fictitious history. The Tale of the Tyne is a story of impressment;
and its appearance could not be better timed, than immediately after our
reforming Ministers have not only refused to abolish the odious tyranny,
against which the story is directed, but Edition: current; Page: [639]
treated those who ventured to express disapprobation of it, as if they
had done something vicious and deserving of opprobrium.

Miss Martineau should send a copy of this tale to each of his Majesty’s
Ministers. We think it would have lowered the insulting tone of Sir
James Graham’s memorable speech on Mr. Buckingham’s motion,1 if he had
read, the evening before, in this little narrative, the meeting, after
years of absence, between a pressed sailor who had deserted, and his
sister. We quote all we can of this most affecting passage, and regret
that our limits do not allow of more:

When Cuddie entered from the garden, his first act was to desire his
sister to fasten the door at the foot of the stairs, and hang up blinds
against both windows, he standing in the shadow till this was done.
Effie timidly objected to blinding the front window which looked down
upon the ferry; it was not yet too late for the possibility of
passengers. This seemed to serve as a new reason; and she was obliged to
hang up her shawl.

“If you want to know the reason,” whispered her brother, “I am a
deserter. Hush! No noise! or you will be the death of me, as Adam was
near being this morning.”

“Won’t you sit down?” said Effie,—as she might have spoken to an
intruder from Bedlam.

“Effie, you always used to say what you felt, and all that you felt. Are
you changed too? Come; tell me what you are thinking.”

“I think I am in a dream, and do not know whether you be Cuddie, or a
fancy of my own. O, Cuddie, I have always loved you next to Walter, and
looked upon you as the pride and hope of the family; and as often as I
have started from sleep, these four years past, it has been with
dreaming over again your being taken at dead of night, and especially
your slipping down the cable. The worst moments I have had from the time
you rowed away from this ferry, that bright evening, are those between
sleeping and waking, when I saw you cold and altered before me, and I
could not by any means make you smile. I never,—no I never believed this
last would come true. And now,—and now,” she uttered between her sobs,
“you know what I am thinking about.”

Cuddie cast himself on the ground, laid his head on her knee, as he had
done in many a childish trouble, weeping so that he could not for long
be persuaded to look up.

“You are not altogether altered, I see,” said Effie, striving to speak
cheerfully. “You are not come back the round-faced, weather-brown seaman
I always fancied you would be, but instead, far too much as if you had
been famished. Yet your heart is the same.”

“No, no.”

“O, yes. But you have known want lately, and you are discouraged. I much
fear you have known want.”

“’Tis not that which has bowed my spirit. Effie, I am altogether
heartbroken.”

“Do not dare to say that. We must bear whatever Providence—”

“But it is not Providence that has done it; it is my king and country,”
cried Cuddie, starting up, the flush fading from his face, and leaving
it of a deadly paleness. “If it had been the will of Providence, Effie,
to take a limb from me, I would have made my way Edition: current; Page:
[640] home on crutches, with a stout heart, and none of you should have
heard a bitter word from me. If lightning from above had scorched out my
eyes, I would have taken Tim for an example, and been thankful through
the live-long day. If the fever had laid me low on shipboard, I would
have been a man to the last, knowing that my corpse would make the
plunge before midnight. But to have one’s king and country against one,
is what is enough to break any man’s heart that has ever loved either of
them.”

“To be sure it is. What have they been doing to you?”

“Things that I do not hold myself bound to bear, as if they were done
according to the will of Providence, and not against it. They first
turned my very heart within me with carrying me away, as if I had been a
black slave; carrying me away from all I cared about, and the occupation
I could most willingly follow. Then, when I had little spirit for my
work, and many bitter thoughts to distract me in it, and hurt my temper,
the next thing they must do is to flog me. What surprises you in that?
Don’t you know that impressment brings flogging? Carry away a man as a
slave, and next thing you must whip him as a thief, and that brings
hanging like a dog. Yes, they flogged me, and my head grew down on my
breast from the time that scornful eyes were for ever upon me. This
morning I have been hunted by my countrymen,—by many an one that I knew
when nobody dared look scornfully on me. It was my own brother’s doing
that they were set on. My country has but one thing more to do with me;
and that is to make away with me for desertion.”

“Then you do not mean to do it yourself, thank God!” cried Effie.

“No, Effie. I have been tempted many a time, from the night I slipped
down the cable, as you mentioned, till this very afternoon, when I hid
in an old coal-pit, and was but too near throwing myself below. I shall
make a trial of what is to be done by going where there is no king, and
where one may forget one’s country. There is not a saint in heaven that
could make me forgive them; but there may be ways of forgetting them. I
will make the trial in America.”

“Then we shall lose the best brother, and my mother the child she has
looked to through every thing, and your king a servant that may ill be
spared during this war.”

“Never mind the king. If he knows no better how to get his subjects to
serve him—”

“Hush, Cuddie! You a seaman, and talk so of your king!”

“I am not a seaman now. However, say the country, if you will: if she
knows no better how to get served than by first making slaves of her
free-born men, let her do as well as she can when they leave her to turn
against her. As soon as she takes a man’s birthright from him, his duty
ceases. Mine was at an end when they carried me off, neck and heels, and
turned me, in one hour, from a brave-hearted boy into a mean-souled
man.”

“No, no.”

“Yes, yes, I say; but though it was so, they had gained no right to
disgrace me. That flogging might possibly have been thought justifiable
by some people, if I had entered the service of my own free will: as I
did not, they had no more right to flog me than the showman yonder has
to goad the lion he enticed into his trap. If that lion should ever get
out a paw to revenge himself, it would go hard with me to help the human
brute.”

Effie was confounded. In casting about for an argument wherewith to stop
this method of discourse, she could find none out of the Bible.
Christian forgiveness of injuries was her plea.

“There is the difference, certainly, between the lion and me,” said
Cuddie: “the Bible is out of the question in his case. It shall be
minded in my own, so far as this:—I will not lift a hand against my
country, and I will go where I may possibly learn to forgive her; but I
cannot do it here Effie,—even if my life were safe, I could not do it
here. My country loses a stout-bodied, willing-hearted member, and I
lose all I have ever lived for; but there the mischief shall stop for
me.”

“Aye, for you; but how many more are there lost in like manner? I think
some devil, in Edition: current; Page: [641] the service of our
country’s enemies, has come to blind our eyes, and harden our hearts,
and make us a sad wonder for the times that are to come. Will men
believe such a story as yours,—such an one as my father’s,—a hundred
years hence?”

“Yes, they will easily believe, because they will look back to what the
service now is, and how it is regarded, and contrast these things with
what, I trust, will be the state of things in their day. They will look
back and see that merchant seamen are now paid more than they need be,
because naval seamen are paid so much less than they ought to be, and
made subject to violence. If, as I hope, in those days, the one service
will be as desirable as the other, (or the king’s, perhaps, the most so
of the two,) it will be found that our colliers will man a navy at the
first call; and then men will believe that when it was otherwise, there
was some fearful cause of wrong that came in between the king and his
seamen.”

“It does seem, indeed, as if there was no lack of loyalty among our
people, when their minds are not turned from their king by some strange
act; and we hear few complaints of the service from those who go
willingly to it.”

“There is none that would be liked so well, if it had fair play. Besides
the honour of keeping off the enemy, and the glory of helping to
preserve one’s country, there is so much variety, and so many
adventures, and so many hundred thousand eyes looking on, that a
sea-life in his Majesty’s service has many charms. But honour is a
mockery to one’s heart, unless it is won by the heart; and what are
varieties of adventure to him whose body may be roving, but whose spirit
sits, like a gloomy, unseen ghost, for ever by his own fire-side?”

“He who goes of his own will has most likely made provision for those he
has left behind; and then the thought of them will come only when it can
animate him, and never to discourage him.”

“Oh, you should see the difference between the volunteers and certain
slaves like me!—how the one are impatient with the captain till he gets
boldly out in search of the enemy; and how the other would fain have the
vessel creep for ever along the shore, that he might have a chance of
stealing out, and forgetting his present disgraces by daring a worse
reproach still. You should see the difference of their patience on the
watch, and of their courage before a battle.”

[Pp. 104-10.]

Can any one read this and not see that it is a true picture? that, of
such causes, such are the natural consequences? The fictitious Cuthbert
Eldred is but a type of the countless multitudes of real living men, who
have been immolated, body and soul, like him, and died the living death
which he so powerfully describes. aIt is not astonishing that in an age
of barbarism men should commit barbarities. That Lord Chatham, one of a
generation of statesmen among whom common humanity seems to have been
almost as rare as common honesty, and in an age in which nothing was
esteemed wickedness by which nobody suffered but the common people—that
Lord Chatham should have seen no harm in impressment, can surprise no
one; but it is equally unexpected and unwelcome to find Lord Chatham’s
authority quoted for it now, as conclusive, by a Reform Minister.2
Edition: current; Page: [642] Necessity! so well described by Milton as
“bthe tyrant’s pleab:”3 it is also Sir James Graham’s, and no one has
yet, in our own day, or in any preceding, carried impudence so far as to
pretend that there can be any other. It is difficult not to feel
degraded by the very act of replying to so base a pretext. Necessity!
yes; to borrow the apt expression of a vigorous writer, “it is exactly
the sort of necessity which men are hanged for:” the convenience of
taking the property of other people without paying for it; with the
aggravation of its being their sole property, and the slight additional
circumstance that the entire wealth of the nation is yours to purchase
it withal, if you cmustc have it. If the whole matter were laid before a
community of ignorant savages; if they could be made to conceive the
clamour, the indignant uproar, which rises from all the benches of a
certain assembly at the bare suggestion of laying a sacrilegious finger
upon anything which borders upon a vested right, upon anything which by
the utmost straining can be construed into property, and then could be
shown the spectacle of the same men hallooing on their leaders to
denounce and insult men for asserting the vested right of the labourer
to his own bodily powers, and calling it injustice to knock him down and
rob him, not of his purse, seeing that he has none, but of all the
property he has,—his labour, in order to save to their own pockets a
fractional part of the wages for which he would consent to sell
it,—would not the assembly of savages deem the assembly of civilized
Christians fit objects for a hurricane to sweep from the earth? What
would they think if they were then told that this same assembly had just
voted twenty millions for the redemption of negro slaves? These men are
not fools, mere absolute fools they cannot be; they cannot think that
kidnapping our own countrymen, and keeping them to forced labour for the
whole or the better part of their lives, differs from negro slavery;
why, every one of the incidents is the same, down to the very cart whip!
call it, if you please, the cat. There is identity even in the wretched
apologies which are set up; the captains or masters are an ill-used,
calumniated race of men, and free labour, forsooth, would be vastly
dearer!a We are obliged, therefore, when we find the same men, at the
same time, actually crusading against everything which is called slavery
in the remote parts of the globe, and battling for it at home as for the
most precious of our institutions, to conclude that it is not the thing
that they are averse to, but only the name; and that their quarrel with
tyranny is not with the tyranny itself, but solely with its
unpopularity.

223.: CONDUCT OF THE MINISTRY WITH RESPECT TO THE POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT, AND THE PAYMENT OF OFFICERS BY FEES
 EXAMINER, 10 NOV., 1833, PP. 706-7

This is the seventh and last of Mill’s leading articles on the
parliamentary session of 1833 prompted by Le Marchant’s The Reform
Ministry; for the entry in his bibliography and the context, see Nos.
216-21. In the Somerville College set of the Examiner, the article is
listed as title and enclosed in square brackets.

the clerks of the post-office, in addition to their authorized salaries,
have large perquisites, not voted annually by Parliament, nor brought
upon the public accounts, but which, like all the gains of public
functionaries, come out of the pockets of the people, and in this
instance in a most objectionable manner. The sources of these irregular
emoluments are various, the most considerable being the privilege of
franking newspapers, and the entire monopoly which that privilege
confers of the supply of foreign journals to persons resident in this
country. The extravagance and the manifold evils of this mode of
remunerating the post-office establishment were recognised as long ago
as 1788, when a Tory commission, appointed by the Tory Ministry of Mr.
Pitt, recommended that the practice should be abolished, and all
emoluments forbidden to the functionaries of the post-office, except in
the form of fixed salaries.1 The recommendation was renewed by the Tory
commissioners of revenue inquiry in their report to the Tory Minister,
the Duke of Wellington, in 1829.2 Here was ground enough, one would
think, for a Reform Ministry to proceed on: but this is not all. A few
months ago the French Government, in a spirit of which it were to be
wished that Governments afforded more frequent examples, sent M. Conte,
their Postmaster-general, to this country on a special mission, to
obtain the consent of our Ministry to several measures for facilitating
communication between the two countries both by letter and by printed
publications.3 Among the foremost of these propositions was one for
suffering the newspapers of each country to be Edition: current; Page:
[644] conveyed by the mails of the other on the same terms with its own,
namely, post free, or at a rate of postage almost nominal. Here was a
proposal which a Ministry of enlarged views and a liberal spirit would
have grasped at with the utmost avidity. Here was an opportunity for
facilitating the circulation of knowledge, the interchange of ideas, and
the increase of friendly feeling between the two leading nations of
Europe; an occasion scarcely to be looked for in a century, of meeting
the liberal overtures of a foreign country for a more extended
intercourse in a corresponding spirit of liberality; for proving to the
statesmen of France that so creditable a wish is reciprocal, that their
aspirations are appreciated and participated in, and that our missions
and our negociations to obtain increased facilities of intercourse are
not mere show and pretence, nor a trick to cajole the French into
granting what are called commercial advantages, but the expression of a
sincere and well-considered and disinterested purpose. Was it so easy
for the French Ministry to effect improvements, that we could afford to
say No, when they voluntarily said Yes? There, as here, we may be sure,
abundance of private interests stand opposed to all innovation; there,
as here, the ease both of superiors and of subordinates is best
consulted by leaving all things as they are. By singular good fortune
all these obstacles were got over without any trouble on our part, and
the French Ministry spontaneously offered what it would have been worth
years of negociation to obtain. Every consideration, not only of liberal
and benevolent policy, but of the narrowest political expediency, was in
favour of the proposal; nothing was opposed to it but the private
interests of the clerks of the post-office. Those interests have
triumphed; the French negociator has gone away unsuccessful! A specimen
of the Reform Ministry.

All comment upon this would be idle, except Lord Althorp’s own. Among
his other endowments, one which Lord Althorp possesses in a supreme
degree, is the faculty of making whatever is exceptionable in his
actions, still worse by the niaiserie of his excuses. Being challenged
on this subject in the House of Commons, he defended himself by saying
that if the monopoly were taken from the clerks of the post-office it
would be necessary to make an equivalent addition to their salaries!4
Suppose it were; what then? But no, my Lord: an addition, perhaps, but
not an equivalent addition: gains which do not see the light are apt to
be considerably larger than would be tolerated if they did: your
Lordship would not dare to propose to Parliament avowed salaries for
these officers, of half the amount of the emoluments which they are at
present allowed to pick up in a dark corner. Look at the schedule
annexed to the Tory Commissioners’ Report, my Edition: current; Page:
[645] Lord.5 Would Sir Francis Freeling,6 for whose office 1000l. a-year
was considered by the Revenue Commissioners to be an adequate
remuneration, have been permitted to receive as an addition to his
salary of 1200l., the 2965l. a-year he now receives as “compensation for
loss of the privilege of franking newspapers to the colonies?”7 Your
Lordship well knows he would not, and so does Sir Francis. Of the
paltriness of making a question like this a mere matter of pounds,
shillings, and pence, neither reckoning the injustice of monopolies in
general, nor the peculiar and odious mischief of a monopoly in favour of
national prejudices and antipathies, and against the most valuable of
all intercourse, that of human thoughts and feelings, we will not trust
ourselves to say anything.

It would be absurd to suspect the Ministers of having any personal
interest in these jobs; what we charge them with is a stupid
insensibility to all the higher considerations which ought to govern
such questions, joined with a dulness and want of discernment which
makes them tools in the hands of any interested person who desires to
use them as such. It is this, and the anti-popular instinct together,
which makes them uphold the taxes on newspapers and political
publications. Who are their advisers in this? The daily newspapers!
monopolists, whom the abolition of those taxes would compel to share
with a hundred rivals the market which they now engross exclusively.
Ministers little know the store of public hatred which they are laying
up for themselves by this, and their defence of the corn laws, and one
or two things more, which the mass of the working people feel to their
heart’s core, and which a Ministry, unexceptionable in every other
respect, could not possibly persevere in for three or four years without
becoming as odious as the Castlereagh Ministry in its worst times.8

But what can Lord Althorp know of public opinion? He, who affirmed that
nine-tenths of the people of England would lament to see the Bishops
ejected from the House of Lords.9 This at a time when their expulsion
from that House on merely religious grounds, quite apart from the almost
universal disgust (there is no other word) at their conduct as
politicians, formed part of every plan of Church Reform brought forward
by friends of the Establishment as absolutely indispensable for
redeeming its character and preserving it in existence! The very time
when the Bishops, as a body, were making themselves the prime agents in
every intrigue for “tripping up” the Ministry, and when their votes
regularly Edition: current; Page: [646] swelled the minorities or
majorities against the most important of the Ministerial measures; this
dexterous tactician chooses that very moment for volunteering a
gratuitous assurance to his bitterest enemies that they have nothing to
fear, and may mature all their machinations against him and his
colleagues, and against the people of Great Britain, in confidence and
security!

But among the wants of these Ministers, want of the higher qualities of
statesmanship is hardly more conspicuous than want of tact, and of
understanding their own position. Surely there never before was a
Ministry which several times in one Session compromised themselves
neck-deep in defence of what they had not strength to hold for a few
weeks following. Surely no Chancellor of the Exchequer but Lord Althorp
would have courted the odium of defending sinecures as a valuable part
of our institutions,10 against motion after motion for their abolition,
and been forced before the end of the Session to appoint a Committee on
purpose to recommend that sinecures should be given up.11 Nor would any
other Minister have voluntarily taken upon himself the load of obloquy
which this foolish Lord incurred by justifying, we know not how many
times, not only the Assessed Taxes, but those inequalities in their
assessment which fly in the faces of mankind; and this with so little
power of maintaining the ground he had so rashly occupied, that in the
very same year he has been constrained to yield what, with the persons
interested, passed and was intended to pass, as an actual promise to
give those taxes up.12

If we continued our examination of the Ministry until every thing in
their conduct which calls for severity of stricture had been exhausted,
we might prolong it till the next Session. But all things must have an
end. We must, therefore, pass over the Ballot, Triennial Parliaments,
Impressment, and numerous other subjects of the utmost importance, but
which unhappily are still alive, and will afford many occasions for
every sort of comment before they are finally disposed of. Here, then,
for the present, our review of the Session must close.

224.: NAPIER’S THE COLONIES
 EXAMINER, 24 NOV., 1833, PP. 740-1

Here Mill returns to a work he had recently praised (see No. 217). He
asked Carlyle on 25 Nov.—a little early, for Carlyle was in
Craigenputtoch—whether he had spotted the review as Mill’s (see No.
222). This lead review, in the “Literary Examiner,” is headed “The
Colonies: Treating of their Value generally; of the Ionian Islands in
particular; the importance of the latter in War and Commerce, as regards
Russian Policy; their Finances; why an expense to Great Britain;
detailed proofs that they ought not to be so; Turkish Government; Battle
of Navarino; Ali Pacha; Sir Thomas Maitland; Strictures on the
Administration of Sir Frederick Adam. By Colonel Charles James Napier,
C.B. [London: Boone, 1833.]” It is described in Mill’s bibliography as
“A review of Colonel Napier’s Work on the Ionian Isles, in the Examiner
of 24th Nov. 1833” (MacMinn, p. 36). In the Somerville College set of
the Examiner, the article is listed as “Review of Colonel Napier’s Work
on the Ionian Isles,” and enclosed in square brackets, with one
correction: at 649.35 “as bad” is altered to “as loud”.

Motto.—“And a more accomplished old woman never drank cat-lap,” said
Maxwell, as he shut the door: “the last word has him, speak it who will;
and yet, because he is a whilly-whaw body, and has a plausible tongue of
his own, and is well enough connected, and especially because nobody
could ever find out whether he is Whig or Tory, this is the third time
they have made him Provost.”— Redgauntlet.1

we have incidentally, in a former article, called attention to this
book, but we cannot let it pass without more particular notice. If we
could, we would cause it to be in the hands of every reader of our
Paper. It is as instructive as if it were the dullest book ever written,
and as amusing as if it had no pretensions to be instructive.

The author, Colonel Napier, is brother to the celebrated historian of
the Peninsular War,2 and a remarkable member of a remarkable family. He
was Resident (Lieutenant-Governor) of Cefalonia, the largest of the
islands which compose the Septinsular Republic, as this curious specimen
of a Government is called.3 Though not a philosopher, (of his general
speculations we do not think by any means highly,) Colonel Napier is
evidently the shrewdest and most Edition: current; Page: [648] sagacious
of practical men; one of the most high-spirited of officers, and, from
the style and character of his book, we are quite certain, one of the
liveliest and pleasantest of companions.

Colonel Napier has done three things in the present work; which we shall
enumerate in the ascending order of their importance. To have done any
one of the three was worth writing twice as large a book.

He has presented, quite incidentally, and seemingly without having such
a purpose in his thoughts, a most lively and interesting picture of a
curious and little known state of society; a rude, scarcely so much as
half civilized, state; blending curiously the general features of
European society five hundred years ago, with influences derived from
the connection and neighbourhood of more civilized nations.

He has supplied to all who may hereafter be called upon to govern, or to
superintend the government of the Ionian Isles, or of any other colony
in the same stage of improvement, an admirable manual; a collection of
precepts and examples, perfectly inestimable. He has shown how these
islands may be governed at no expense to Great Britain, and so that the
Government shall be a blessing to the inhabitants, who, but for our
protection, would lie prostrate at the feet of their own wealthier
classes. He has made it clear, both by reasoning and actual experiment,
that to render our occupation of that country quite invaluable to its
people, nothing whatever is necessary but that the men we send thither
shall be men of good sense and discernment, capable of understanding the
state of society they are set to preside over, and the nature of the
social evils which they have to contend against. On the other hand, he
has shown but too plainly how for want of understanding these things,
our government there may be made a burden on our own treasury; and with
respect to the islands themselves, merely an additional instrument in
the hands of the rich to pillage and trample upon the poor.

The last, and greatest, because most far-reaching benefit which Colonel
Napier has conferred upon his country by this volume, is to anatomize
and exhibit, in the person of Sir Frederick Adam,4 a specimen of a class
of public men, the sort of men described in his motto; the most numerous
class of all; the men who have no character, no will of their own; whom,
consequently, nobody is jealous of, or afraid of; and whom, therefore,
if aristocratically connected, everybody is ready to thrust into
situations for which they are totally unfit; and who then become mere
instruments in the hands of those who will take greatest Edition:
current; Page: [649] pains to talk them over, (a familiar phrase,
exactly expressive of the process,) that is, of those who have a private
interest to serve; the men, in short, who answer to the description in
Hudibras—

-   

    . . . a tool
-   

    Which knaves do work with, called a fool.5

This sort of men, when placed in situations of important trust, are
precisely the most dangerous of all; the mischief they do is quite
incalculable. To such men, any man of an active and strong
understanding, let him be even a knave, is far preferable. A maxim,
strikingly exemplified by the contrast between the administration of Sir
Frederick Adam, and that of Sir Thomas Maitland, his predecessor.6 Sir
Thomas was the corruptest of Tories, and, unless he is greatly wronged,
one of the most unscrupulous of Governors; and, as appears from many
anecdotes in this book, rough and coarse-minded almost to brutality. But
he had a sound and vigorous understanding and a strong will; and that
love of the right, when not under great temptation to do wrong, which a
clear-headed and determined man always has. He understood his position,
and the sphere in which he moved. He saw that the great business of a
Governor in a state of society like that of the Ionian Isles, is to
protect the weak against the strong. He saw, that if the poor were to be
protected at all, the executive government must be their protector;
because the courts of justice, to which, in a more advanced state of
society, the repression and punishment of injuries may safely be left,
cannot in that semi-barbarous state be so constituted as not to be
habitually bribed or intimidated by the rich and powerful. Accordingly
Sir Thomas made himself the patron of the poor man, and governed the
Seven Islands, in spite of many defects, with a more vigorous and a more
beneficent rule, than they have probably ever known since they first
were inhabited.

Sir Frederick Adam, a man without Sir Thomas Maitland’s bad qualities,
and without one particle of his energy and strong good sense, succeeded
to him; and, although during the whole of Sir Thomas’s administration he
had been second in command, and had the amplest opportunities of
profiting by the example, the history of his administration is that of
the gradual undoing of the good work which his predecessor had begun.
Sir Thomas Maitland had protected the weak against the strong; the
practice of Sir Frederick Adam was to believe the representations of the
strong against the weak. It was not that he had any preference for the
strong; if there had been any one to talk as long and as loud to him on
the other side of the question, the other side was as likely to have
Edition: current; Page: [650] prevailed. He was simply in the very
common case of having no ideas of his own, nor capacity of acquiring
them, and consequently adopting those, whatever they might be, which
were most frequently presented to him. The rich and powerful, having
most access to his ear, had most opportunities of pouring into it the
representations which suited their purposes.

Colonel Napier was able for several years, in spite of perpetual
counteraction from the knot of interested advisers by whom the Governor
was surrounded, to preserve the administration of the island over which
he presided from the rapid degeneracy which the others speedily
underwent. Having a mind full of resource, fertile in contrivances,
being a thorough man of action in the best sense, knowing the world, and
judging skilfully of men, he chose his expedients with admirable skill;
was always for a little while countenanced and applauded by Sir
Frederick Adam; and, as soon as he had been sufficiently successful to
give umbrage to any person with whose corrupt gains, or whose arbitrary
powers his plans interfered, he had the mortification of finding them
all knocked on the head.

After some time, Colonel Napier came to England on leave of absence,
receiving on his passage through Corfu, the strongest demonstrations of
friendship and confidence from the Governor. During his absence Sir
Frederick Adam made a public declaration in Cefalonia, that on Colonel
Napier’s return he should not reappoint him to his office, under
pretence that an insurrection which had broken out many months after the
Colonel’s departure had been provoked by the arbitrary nature of his
administration. On learning this, Colonel Napier immediately demanded an
inquiry, and having with some difficulty compelled Sir Frederick to make
his accusations specific, addressed to the Colonial Office a reply which
absolutely levels the unfortunate man with the dust.7

The conduct of Lord Goderich was most characteristic. A man like Sir
Thomas Maitland, in the situation of Colonial Secretary, from the mere
inspection of the controversial correspondence, the accusation and the
defence, would have seen enough of the two men to have perceived at once
which was fittest to be Governor of the Ionian Isles; and if to Sir
Thomas Maitland’s abilities he had added honesty, Sir Frederick would
speedily have ceased to fill the office, and Colonel Napier would have
been his successor. Lord Goderich, on the contrary, seems to have had no
object in view but to spare himself the responsibility of deciding. He
would neither put Sir Frederick Adam in the right nor say he was in the
wrong. Before the inquiry, and for the purpose of saving himself from
the trouble of it, he offered to Colonel Napier a superior appointment,
the Residency of Zante.8 But as the Colonel refused to pocket the
unmerited accusation, and demanded that Sir Frederick Adam should be
required either to restore him to his former post or produce charges
against him; he obtained the inquiry which he Edition: current; Page:
[651] had demanded, made the most triumphant of vindications, and
received no redress. Lord Goderich “did not feel authorized to interfere
between a Lord High Commissioner and his Resident:”9 it was no part of
the duty of a Colonial Secretary to exercise any controul over the
Governor of a colony. No decision has ever been pronounced. Colonel
Napier, who might have obtained a higher appointment if he would have
submitted to be disgraced, has lost the situation he held, and it needs
no prophet to predict that he will never obtain that or any other from
the present Government. He has appealed to the press:10 the one
unpardonable offence. He has shown up the folly and negligence of men in
high place. No man who does this need expect public employment. He has
written a book which proves him to be the fittest person in the United
Kingdom to be Governor of the Seven Islands, and that is the quite
sufficient hindrance to his being made either that or anything else.

People of England, how long will these things be?


225.: THE MONTHLY REPOSITORY FOR DECEMBER 1833
 EXAMINER, 15 DEC., 1833, PP. 788-9

Once again Mill acknowledged his authorship of an article in the
Examiner to Carlyle (12 Jan., 1834; EL, CW, Vol. XII, p. 209). Mill had
nothing in this number of the Monthly Repository, though his “Comparison
of the Tendencies of French and English Intellect” (No. 158) had
appeared in November. The review, in the “Literary Examiner,” is headed
“The Monthly Repository for December [n.s. VII]. Edited by W.J. Fox”;
page references are to this volume. This notice, the fifth in a series
beginning with No. 198, is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A review
of the December number of the Monthly Repository, in the Examiner of
15th December 1833” (MacMinn, p. 36). In the Somerville College set of
the Examiner, it is listed as “Review of the Monthly Repository for
December” and enclosed in square brackets.

we think this the best number yet published of a periodical which is
rising rapidly into the high estimation it continues more and more to
deserve. The same solidity of thought and justness of judgment, the same
ardent sympathy with the emotions, interests, and aspirations of the
poorer classes, the same enthusiastic feeling for, that is, of, the good
and the beautiful, manifest themselves under more varied forms, and in a
still more sustained and more impressive manner. Most of the numerous
and diversified articles in this number, scarcely leave room for a wish
that they could be better, either in design or execution. They are all
that they profess to be, and all that their subjects require.

Edition: current; Page: [652]
The volume which closes the year, is inscribed—

-   

    To the Working People
-   

    of
-   

    Great Britain and Ireland;
-   

    who, whether they produce
-   

    The means of physical support and enjoyment,
-   

    or aid the progress of
-   

    Moral, political, and social reform and improvement,
-   

    are fellow-labourers for the well-being
-   

    of the entire community.

To no work could such a dedication be more appropriately annexed, for
the well-being of the classes to whom the work is thus addressed, is,
indeed, the polar star of its course; and by their well-being is not
meant, in this work, their physical comfort, nor even their political
independence, but these and likewise the invigorating of their
understanding and the refinement of their tastes. Not the frivolous,
washy “mental improvement” which lords and gentlemen patronizingly and
condescendingly administer when they cater “useful knowledge for the
people,” always with an eye to diverting them from the discussion of the
great social questions, and “keeping them in their proper station.” If
this be philanthropy, Mr. Fox is no philanthropist. Speaking of the
mechanics of England, he says, or the Repository says for him:

Their intelligence, their principles, their growing moral power, are
indications of approaching change, not merely in political forms, but in
the structure of society which it is high time to study, and on which a
philosophical and courageous statesman, if such an one the country were
but blessed withal, would already begin to act, and that on no petty
scale. Happily this growing power is not one of brute force; it is a
developement of intelligence. To us, therefore, there is in it nothing
fearful. The only evil which we apprehend is in the kind of resistance
which may be opposed to it. It may be guided, but it cannot be coerced:
and the attempt to mislead it, for the private benefit of other classes,
will not fail less signally, nor recoil less destructively, than even
coercion itself. We have long been impressed by the conviction that the
intellect of poverty must be self-instructed, that it will not feed on
the crumbs which fall from the rich man’s table; that the real teachers
of the poorer class must themselves be men of that class, imbued with
its peculiar feelings, alive to its peculiar interests, influenced even
by its peculiar prejudices; but, by their native power of mind, strongly
conscious of its peculiar wants, and of capacity to minister to the
supply of those wants. Such are the teachers who will be attended to
without suspicion: whose words will have many echoes from the multitudes
of their brethren, while the voice of condescending instruction dies
without response on the empty air. Laughable as it might lately have
been deemed, the “producing men” are actually producing their own
politicians and poets; and such too as feel it to be grander and a
nobler part, to make common cause with their brethren, raising their
minds and refining their tastes, than to become, as was the old
practice, the flattered appendages of superior station, tame monsters,
with the range of the kitchen, rising into the livery dignity of
patronage, hot-pressed paper, and a subscription list.1

Edition: current; Page: [653]
In every word of this we concur; but with the qualification, that not
only the more vigorous minds in the poorer class, but persons also with
the superior opportunities of instruction afforded by a higher station,
may be, (and of this the writer himself is an example) most efficient
instructors of the poorer classes, provided they have sufficient freedom
from the littleness of mind which caste-distinctions engender, and a
sufficiently just appreciation of the intelligence of the reading part
of the working-classes, to prevent them from being condescending
instructors. No gentleman is fit to write for the poor who cannot help
betraying in every line that he habitually deems himself a being of a
different order from them, and vastly their superior, that he cannot for
one half hour lose the consciousness of his artificial and conventional
rank, but is perpetually showing it in the most offensive of all ways,
that of taking credit for not showing it. He must learn to speak to the
working-people as an equal to his equals, as he would speak to persons
less informed than himself on the particular subject, but with minds
quite as capable of understanding it. When, moreover, the assumption of
superiority over their intellect, and the ostentation of descending to
make himself intelligible to their ignorant minds is accompanied with an
attempt to pass off upon them, even though in a good cause, palpable
sophisms which the least discerning of them has intellect enough to see
through, he but excites the contempt, mingled with aversion, which a
large portion of the reading mechanics feel for the instructions in
political economy which have been put forth to the “working man” by the
Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.2

The vigorous and impressive article from which we have quoted is itself
a review of a remarkable work, a poem, by a mechanic, entitled Saint
Monday.3 The extracts from the poem are as interesting as the review
itself, which concludes thus:

We say to him (the Author) and his fellow-labourers, go on and prosper,
and so saying we include ourselves in our own benediction, for we have a
common purpose with him and them. We adhere to the St. Simonian maxim,4
(even though the Times should recommend our being pelted for the same;)
we contend that the legitimate object of all Edition: current; Page:
[654] political institutions is the improvement of the condition,
physical, intellectual, and moral, of the poorest and most numerous
class. We hold that this object is paramount in social arrangements. We
believe in no real discrepancy; but if there were, coûte qui coûte, the
progression of humanity must be exhibited in those who toil. Their
rights and interests should be pursued by all honourable means, and at
all real risk; by unions, by meetings, by cheap publications, by
petitions and remonstrances, and by whatever else circumstances may
require; and that, whatever becomes of churches, corporations, or
monopolies of peers or princes; the physical comfort, the mental
cultivation, the political rights of the working-people of England, that
is the motto on our banner; we nail that flag to the mast, and will sink
or swim with it flying, so help us God.

[P. 837.]

Next to this unflinching advocacy of the interests of the
working-classes the most characteristic distinction of this periodical
from others is a keen sensibility to the beautiful in all its kinds and
varieties, and the strongest interest, manifested both by precept and
example, in poetry and art, not as idle amusements, but important
branches of human culture, and agents in the progression of the species.

We quote from a delightful article on the Louvre a description of a
picture, itself almost a still lovelier picture:

It is all that a National gallery ought to be. Watch the people
clustered round, and being educated by their favourite pictures; look at
their eager intelligent faces; listen to their doubly happy remarks,
reading all they can from a picture, too poor to purchase a catalogue,
and courteously asking the more fortunate to help them to its subject.
Soldiers, too, but they are of the National Guard, not your mere
legalized cut-throats; generals, colonels, and captains, would do well,
if true to their profession, to keep all such from picture-galleries.
The arts are meant to refine, their system to brutalize. One fancies
that soldiers would choose battle pieces (of which, be it said, there
are vastly too many taken as subjects by the French artists—more of that
anon). Not so; there is one with his eyes fixed on a picture of Annibal
Carracci, the quietest, gentlest, most exquisitely touched! It is called
Le Silence, and you hold your breath, and do not speak as you look at
it. The catalogue says, La Vierge recommande le silence à St. Jean, pour
ne pas troubler le repos de Jésus. That recommande sounds strangely, but
what other word could be found? The sweet, earnest face of the mother,
whose arm tenderly cradles the sleeping child—sleeping so placidly, that
you hear in fancy the gentle breathing through its parted lips; her
upraised, hushing finger, her slight bending forward, as if to check the
little disciple, who is making his whole body minister to one tiny
finger, that it may fall like down upon the foot of the sleeper. . . .
The soldier is still gazing, and if you asked him why? he would perhaps
answer, Because the woman was so douce, and the children so jolis. We
would make answer for him, that he has a human heart—that he is
enjoying, perhaps unconsciously, the expression of brotherly affection
and expansive benevolence. The mother’s face is alike free from the
harshness of rebuke or the weakness of entreaty. She is careful of the
feelings of the child of another, as she is watchful over the repose of
her own; she is not one to exact obedience through fear, but to change
it into pleasure through affection—the face of that mother, the act of
that child, are lovely lessons of kindness and gentleness, from which
all, whether men, women, or children, may learn equally.5

Edition: current; Page: [655]
The gallery of the Louvre on a Sunday, and the working men and the
working women whom it is filled with, are indeed a spectacle which we
have never seen without envying those who have the happiness to live in
an unaristocratic country; a country where the rich and the poor having
the same enjoyments, do not repel, but attract each other; where the
very populace, in the height of an armed insurrection, place sentinels
to guard their own gallery of statues and pictures from injury, and
chalk up in every street the words, “Respect aux Monuments.”

The “Autobiography of Pel. Verjuice” becomes more and more interesting.6
It contains this month a vivid portraiture of the horrors of a
man-of-war, which would be deemed one of the most vigorous chapters of
the best recent novels, and as an authentic biography will, if generally
read, strike a heavier blow at impressment, and the present naval
discipline, than twenty of Sir James Graham’s most insolent speeches
will be able to parry.7

An excellent article on Church Reform,8 advocates with equal strength of
feeling and vigour of argument, the right of the nation to do what it
pleases with the public property, called by an abuse of terms, the
“property of the Church,” and the expediency of exercising that right by
taking the Church endowments (after the death of existing incumbents)
not to be swallowed up in the bottomless pit of the National Debt, but
to form a fund for the mental culture of the people in the most
extensive sense, by education, and the diffusion and encouragement of
all branches of science and art.

There is much more in this number of the Repository, which we would
gladly notice, but we must conclude; and we shall do so by a quotation
from the address of the editor to his readers at the close of the year:

With a satisfaction, in which I trust my readers will join, do I look
back, not only on the accession of so many enlightened and philosophical
minds, attracted by congeniality with the spirit of the Monthly
Repository, to labour for the extension of its influences, but also on
the topics which have exercised their powers. The experiment has, unless
I am much deceived in the result, been made successfully, of rendering a
periodical interesting without sacrificing to mere amusement, to
personal calumny, or to party or private objects. On every great
question, however brief the space allowed for its discussion, it has
been attempted to penetrate to the true and ultimate principles of
solution. Caring comparatively little about particular men or temporary
measures, constant regard has been had to those pervading evils of the
social condition, and those redeeming and progressive tendencies of the
human constitution, which must be understood before the one can be
effectually redressed, or the other can have their free and full
operation in the production Edition: current; Page: [656] of the
happiness which man was created to enjoy. Using words which have been
egregiously misapplied, it may be justly said, that on whatever point
reform or change has been advocated, we were destructive9 only that we
might be conservative. And that for the conservation of which, free from
all impediment, we are most solicitous, is the principle of progression
in humanity; a principle which is ever growing in strength with the
growth of knowledge; which must and will burst all the bonds, and
demolish all the barriers of antiquated institutions; and on which
Governments must learn to act, unless they are content to be regarded as
the present enemies of nations, and the speedy victims of revolutions.

226.: FRENCH NEWS [81]
 EXAMINER, 29 DEC., 1833, P. 824

As Mill noted in his letter to Carlyle of 12 Jan., 1834 (EL, CW, Vol.
XII, p. 209), he had resumed his comments on French affairs; again his
attention is focused on the French legislature, which opened on 23 Dec.
The item is headed “London, December 29, 1833.” This group of Mill’s
French news reports is described in his bibliography as “The summary of
the French news in the Exam. from 29th December 1833 to 16 February
1834” (MacMinn, p. 36). The next mention of these summaries is of that
for 30 Mar., 1834 (see No. 245); however, three articles on 2, 9, and 23
Mar. are identified as his in the Somerville College set of the Examiner
(see Nos. 238, 241, and 242). The present article, his last in 1833, is
listed in the Somerville College set of the Examiner as “Article on
France” and enclosed in square brackets.

the speech of louis-philippe, at the opening of the Session, may be
regarded, even among Kings’ speeches, as remarkable for its emptiness.1
His Citizen Majesty (we beg his pardon, for the days are gone by when
even words of revolutionary sound had the honour of his countenance)
doubtless shares the opinion next to universal among his supporters as
well as enemies, that what is said or done in, to, or by the Chambers,
is of the completest insignificance. There are few things more striking
in the present state of France, than the contemptuous neglect into which
the national legislature has fallen.

Another trial for a conspiracy to overthrow the Government has just
terminated by the acquittal of all the accused.2 The prosecution had
first broken Edition: current; Page: [657] down so completely, that the
Advocate-General, in his concluding speech, was forced to admit that
there was not sufficient evidence against the two persons whom he had
represented as being at the head of the conspiracy.3 But the best
purpose of the persecutors is answered; the detestable Code
d’Instruction Criminelle, framed by Napoleon as an instrument for his
despotism, gives power to the Government in all such cases of keeping
the accused in prison for months before bringing them to trial;4 this
power has been exerted towards the present accused, who have been in
prison for five months untried, and numbers of others are now in
confinement who will as surely as these be acquitted by the jury, and
perhaps sent to prison immediately afterwards on a fresh charge. The
French Government, by suborning false or frivolous charges, or even by
lending an ear to the denunciations which their police spies are never
unprepared with, have the power of converting any man, however innocent,
into a prisoner for life. The only person of any note who was implicated
in the present trial, Raspail, a young chemist of great eminence, has
for three years past been seldom out of prison, though almost all the
charges against him have been scouted by the various juries before whom
he has successively been brought.

During the present trial, one of the witnesses, by name Vignerte, on
hearing the Society of the Rights of Man, of which society he is a
member and officer, accused by the Advocate-General of designing
confiscation of property and an agrarian law, could not contain his
indignation, and gave the Crown lawyer the lie direct in open Court. For
this, and for calling the Judges, what they richly deserved to be
called, un tas de valets,5 the Court sentenced him on the spot to three
years’ imprisonment. It is monstrous that a tribunal should thus have
the power of judging in its own cause, under the influence, too, of
momentary irritation, and inflicting sentences of vindictive severity. A
Court of Justice should have the command of adequate physical force to
preserve order during its proceedings, but the punishment of words or
acts disrespectful to it should be left to another time and to other
men.

Three of the counsel of the accused, men who are among the principal of
the rising ornaments of the French bar, have been, for pretended
disrespect to the Edition: current; Page: [658] Court, suspended by the
Court from the practice of their profession, one of them for a year, the
other two for six months each.6 Is not this also monstrous?

 EXAMINER, 5 JAN., 1834, P. 840

This paragraph is headed “London, January 5, 1834.” For Mill’s
bibliographic entry, see No. 226. In the Somerville College set of the
Examiner, the article is listed as “Article on France”; none of Mill’s
articles in 1834 is enclosed in square brackets. This first issue of the
Examiner for 1834 was misnumbered by the printer, pp. [833]-848; the
pagination began anew with each year, and Mill has renumbered the pages

the french chamber of deputies has re-elected M. Dupin its President,
and Messrs. de Schonen, Benjamin Delessert,1 Etienne, and Béranger its
Vice-presidents, as before. This betokens, as everything does, a Session
exactly resembling the last. M. Dupin had 220 votes: the greatest number
next to this was 39, for General Lafayette. These 39, together with the
General himself, indicate 40 as the number of republicans in the
Chamber. A few votes were given to M. Dupont (de l’Eure), and a few to
M. Odilon Barrot; the remainder of the non-republican opposition, (the
opposition dynastique, as they are now called,) a party which is sinking
every day into greater insignificance, voted with the ministry and the
tiers-parti for M. Dupin.


228.: WAR WITH RUSSIA
 EXAMINER, 5 JAN., 1834, P. 840

This paragraph, which immediately follows that in No. 227 under the
dateline “London, January 5, 1834,” is not mentioned in Mill’s
bibliography. However, it is listed in the Somerville College set of the
Examiner as “Paragraph on a war with Russia”; like No. 227 (q.v.) it is
listed by Mill as on p. 8.

the times has this week busied itself in instigating Government and the
nation to a war which would infallibly involve not only all Europe, but
Asia, Africa, and Edition: current; Page: [659] America also.1 A
Ministry which should go to war to prevent Russia from taking possession
of Turkey, especially when it is too late to save Poland, would deserve
to lose their heads; and we trust it would not be long ere they would be
reminded of the liability.


229.: THE MONTHLY REPOSITORY FOR JANUARY 1834
 EXAMINER, 12 JAN., 1834, P. 21

The sixth of Mill’s favourable reviews of the Monthly Repository (see
No. 198), this is mentioned, like Nos. 225 and the series on France
beginning with No. 226, in his letter to Carlyle of 12 Jan. (EL, CW,
Vol. XII, p. 215). Again Mill had nothing in this issue of the Monthly
Repository, but his series, “Notes on Some of the More Popular Dialogues
of Plato,” began in the next number, and continued until March 1835 (see
CW, Vol. XI, pp. 37-174). Also, his “Notes on the Newspapers,” a series
on British events not unlike his French series, began in the March
number, running until September (see CW, Vol. VI, pp. 149-280). This
review, in the “Literary Examiner,” is headed “The Monthly Repository
for January [n.s. VIII]. Edited by W.J. Fox”; the page numbers refer to
this volume. Described in Mill’s bibliography as “A review of the
January number of the Monthly Repository of 12th January 1834” (MacMinn,
p. 36), the article is listed in the Somerville College set of the
Examiner as “Review of the Monthly Repository for January 1834.”

the present number of this excellent and rising periodical maintains the
high character of its immediate predecessor. The work becomes every day
more worthy of public support. It stands conspicuous among the
periodicals of the day, not less in the comprehensiveness of its objects
and views, than in its progressive and rapid improvement in point of
literary merit.

The number now published commences with a brief review of the political
situation of the country at the opening of 1834;1 in which, while none
of the evils and dangers we have yet to struggle with are disguised or
extenuated, the tone of the writer is not discouraging but animating,
and inspires the reader to arm himself with renewed vigour for the
perennial contest, which more or less at all times, but most peculiarly
in the present, is the lot of humanity.

The “Case of the Dissenters” is the subject of an article, the spirit of
which is all in the following passage:

It is much to be deprecated that Church reform should become, in the
Legislature, Edition: current; Page: [660] merely a question between the
established sect and the non-established sects. Should that happen, the
result will most likely be a stopping short in, and turning aside from,
the course which ought to be pursued in order to obtain from change the
greatest amount of national good. It is very possible that matters may
be compromised between the clergy, who, practically, are the Church, on
the one hand; and the leading denominations of dissenters on the other.
“Holy Orders,” and “pretended Holy Orders,” may be made to stand (with
the exception of the money difference, and of the preference of fashion)
on the same step of the social platform; dissenting lovers may be
allowed to join hands in the unconsecrated chapel; and the dissenting
dead be allowed, with the benediction on their bones of the voice which
in life they loved, to rest in the consecrated burial ground. Nay,
tithes may be no longer levied, as at present, and church rates be
receipted by a pastor’s certificate of membership. All this, and more,
may happen, even until insolence and grumbling shall be hushed together,
and the “righteousness” of the Church and the “peace” of dissent shall
have “embraced each other;” and yet the people remain destitute of
advantages to which they have a right, and the prospect of obtaining
which, imparts its highest value, its properly national interest, to the
subject of Church reform.

All considerations about rival parties, sectarian rights, and
ecclesiastical inequalities, shrink into comparative insignificance
before the great question—Shall that huge mass of property, which is now
unworthily held by the hierarchy, continue to be so perverted, or be
applied to its legitimate purpose, the intellectual and moral culture of
the entire population?—This is the question which, in proportion as the
people understand their rights and interests, they will require of the
Legislature to answer. This is the question which every patriotic
legislator should moot. This is the question which the press should
unceasingly agitate and discuss. It is the “case” of the people, and
should swallow up the case of the dissenters.2

The paper headed “The Diffusion of Knowledge amongst the People,” (being
the substance of two lectures read at the Mechanics’ Institution by the
author of several known works,) is, notwithstanding the title, not at
all common-place, and abounds with useful thoughts well expressed.3

The “Autobiography of Pel. Verjuice,” continues and improves every
month.4 But the article which will be oftenest reperused, and with
greatest pleasure, is a notice of the pictures in the Luxembourg
Gallery, evidently by the same hand as the paper in the previous number
on the Louvre.5 We think the criticism too favourable to the modern
French school, but the descriptions of the pictures have all the
poetical beauty which they ascribe to the pictures themselves.

In this number of the Repository there is a new feature, a song with
music, being the first of “Songs of the Months,” the remaining eleven
will appear in the succeeding numbers.6 The merit both of the poetry and
the music is sufficiently Edition: current; Page: [661] vouched for by
the fact, that the latter is composed by the accomplished author of the
Musical Illustrations of the Waverley Novels.7

We heartily applaud this enlargement of the plan of the Repository,
which is perfectly in keeping with its spirit. The work is now more than
ever entitled to the character it already deserved, of being the
cheapest of the monthly periodicals, for the music alone, if printed
separately, could not be purchased for less than the entire price of the
work which contains it.


230.: FRENCH NEWS [83]
 EXAMINER, 12 JAN., 1834, P. 23

For the entry in Mill’s bibliography, see No. 226. This article, headed
“London, January 12, 1834,” is listed as “Article on France” in the
Somerville College set of the Examiner.

the debate of the French Chamber of Deputies on the address in answer to
the King’s Speech is now nearly concluded.1 We have deemed it useless to
lay before our readers a meagre abstract which would utterly fail in
conveying any notion of the general spirit of the debate. The
circumstance which appears to have made the strongest impression on our
English contemporaries, is the distinct disavowal of Republicanism and
declaration of attachment to hereditary monarchy, which has emanated
from MM. Odilon Barrot, Mauguin,2 and other leaders of the
Constitutional opposition; on the other hand, MM. Voyer d’Argenson and
Audry de Puyraveau, men of the highest character and personal merit,
being called to account by a member for having affixed their signature
to the Republican manifesto of the Société des Droits de l’Homme, avowed
and justified their conduct.3

As we find that some English journals are propagating the same false
Edition: current; Page: [662] impressions respecting this society, and
making the same indefensible use of the name of Robespierre, for the
purpose of discrediting its intentions, as the Government papers in
France had already done,4 we shall next week do what no English paper,
we believe, has yet attempted; we shall state exactly what the society
in question is, what are its principles and objects, and in what manner
the name of Robespierre has come to be mixed up with it.5 At present we
shall only say that the Société des Droits de l’Homme represents only a
fraction of the Republican party, if party it can be called; a fraction
which carries its views of innovation further than even what are
considered the most violent of the Republican newspapers: and though it
holds the entire insurrectional strength of the party in its hands, or
rather is the only Republican party which any person in his senses
believes to meditate insurrection, the Republican cause for purposes of
discussion and popular enlightenment, is in far more efficient as well
as more temperate hands.

In separating itself avowedly from Republicanism, the opposition in the
Chamber has taken the only means by which it could have a chance of
recovering some political importance. The Chamber is no place for
advocating doctrines in advance of the existing charter; for such the
press is the proper organ; in the Chamber an orator, even of the most
commanding talents, could not obtain a hearing for such opinions as are
held by the ablest opponents of the present French Government. There is
still room in the Chamber for a Constitutional or Monarchical
opposition; but the men whose opinions fitted them for composing such a
party, by merely carping at the measures of Government in detail,
without wedding themselves to any principle, had allowed all popular
influence to pass out of their hands into those of the bolder, more
consistent, and, we must add, abler men who form the Republican
opposition out of doors. They are now making an effort, and of the right
kind, to redeem themselves from the insignificance into which they have
sunk; they have declared unequivocally their political creed. They are
adverse to a new revolution, adverse to the abolition of hereditary
Monarchy; but they contend strongly for a large extension of the
suffrage in the election of members of the Chamber of Deputies.

The French people are at last awakening to the truth, of which the
English from their longer experience have been for some time aware—that
the constitution of the representative body is the really vital question
of Government; and that their own rests on far too narrow a basis. For
the first time, numerous Edition: current; Page: [663] petitions are now
preparing from various parts of France for a more popular system of
election.


231.: WILSON’S HISTORY OF ROME
 EXAMINER, 19 JAN., 1834, P. 36

The History of Rome was one of an eventual 133 volumes in the popular
Cabinet Cyclopaedia, initiated in 1829 by Dionysius Lardner (1793-1859),
a prolific writer on science, who had been elected Professor of Natural
Philosophy and Astronomy at the University of London in 1827. The
anonymous work has been attributed to Robert Bell (1800-67), an
associate of Lardner’s, but there is little reason to doubt Mill’s
attribution of it to his friend, John Wilson, Secretary to the Factory
Commission in 1833 and Editor of the Globe and Traveller in 1834, called
by Mill “a most valuable man” (EL, CW, Vol. XII, p. 211). Mill’s
childhood fascination with Roman history (see CW, Vol. I, pp. 17, 583-4)
led to little mature writing; see, however, in addition to this review,
CW, Vol. I, pp. 523-32 and in Vol. XIII, pp. 498-551, the letters from
the early 1840s indicating an abortive plan to write a major article on
the subject for the Edinburgh. The review, which heads the “Literary
Examiner,” is headed: “The Cabinet Cyclopaedia, conducted by Dr.
Lardner; History of Rome. In two volumes; Vol. I. [London: Longman, et
al., 1834.]” It is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A review of
(John Wilson’s) History of Rome in Lardner’s Cyclopaedia, vol. 1, in the
Examiner of 19th January 1834” (MacMinn, p. 37). In the Somerville
College set of the Examiner, it is listed as “Review of the History of
Rome (Wilson’s) in Lardner’s Cyclopaedia.”

we recommend this work very strongly to the English reader, as being the
first compendium of Roman history yet published in England, in which the
early ages of the Roman state have been exhibited in the new and
striking light thrown upon them by the researches and speculations of
Niebuhr, Wachsmuth, and other recent German writers of eminence.1 Such a
work has long been much wanted, and we trust it will be as extensively
read as it deserves to be.

The author disclaims any pretension to originality in his remarks on the
Roman character, and the structure of Roman society; which he says are
mostly drawn from the great historical work of Professor Schlosser, of
Heidelberg, on the Civilization of the Ancient World.2 To whomsoever
these remarks belong, they are such as are to be found in no English
book with which we are acquainted; and Edition: current; Page: [664] are
generally ingenious, often strikingly just, and always the very reverse
of common place. They should induce all who can read German to study
Professor Schlosser’s work; and all who cannot, should read the present
volume; which, departing so widely from the beaten track, will suggest
to all who reflect upon history, even if they do not agree in the
writer’s opinions, many trains of valuable reflection.

A work of this character cannot be expected to form a complete treatise
on the philosophy of Roman history; that would require far greater
labour and even to the highest powers of intellectual combination would
be a task of years. But it is much to find in a work of so little
pretension all that we find in this.

We are averse to point out particular chapters as peculiarly deserving
of notice, when all merit the most attentive perusal; but when we have
so recently read in an accredited Tory periodical the astounding
assertion, that the senseless measures of the Gracchi, by destroying the
Roman aristocracy, occasioned the fall of the republic,3 it is not,
perhaps, useless to direct the attention of those whom our judgment may
influence to the chapter on the Gracchi, (Bk. III, Chap. ii of this
work,) and to the description of the Roman aristocracy in the ninth
chapter of the same book.4 Truly the notions, even as to mere matters of
fact, which are poured into the long ears of our higher classes, and
thence infiltrated into their brains, are of an absurdity which, the
longer we live, appears to us the more portentous.


232.: FRENCH NEWS [84]
 EXAMINER, 19 JAN., 1834, PP. 40-1

This article is headed “London, January 19, 1834.” Mill’s bibliographic
entry for this series (from 29 Dec., 1833, to 16 Feb., 1834; see No.
226) does not specifically say that he wrote the summary in each of
those weeks, and in the Somerville College set of the Examiner, the
listing is “Article on the ‘National’ Newspaper,” which would suggest
that only that part here printed after a printer’s rule is his. However,
no one else filled in the French news when Mill did not contribute a
column, and the internal references to Nos. 230 and 233, as well as the
correction to the second paragraph in his hand in the Somerville College
set of the Examiner (“debate on the” added before “French King’s
speech”) argue strongly for his authorship of the first section. In the
second section Mill made three corrections: at 666.7, “Carrels” is
altered to “Carrel”; at 667.6 “intruded” to “intended”; and at 667.13
“mark” to “wreak”.

Edition: current; Page: [665]
we are under the necessity of deferring till next week our observations
on the Société des Droits de l’Homme.1

The debate on the French King’s speech has now concluded, and the
address has been carried by a majority of 288 to 43.2

The Duc de Broglie, whose retractation of acquiescence in M. Bignon’s
speech we noticed last week, is reproached with eating his own words,
&c.3 Be it so; but the motives which caused him to eat his own words are
motives which must restrain the disposition to rush into war. The Times
seems to take the disappointment much to heart, and rails against the
wickedness of the “low Radicals” who preach peace.4 We frankly confess
to all the wickedness of an earnest desire for peace, which we would not
forego till some greater evil seemed likely to attend it than is certain
in war. But these are low politics akin to the low morality so scoffed
at by Jonathan Wild the Great, in his history by Fielding;5
nevertheless, we have shared in them with worshipful company; witness
the following passage from the ministerial Globe, which appeared when
Russia was going to war with Turkey in 1828:

If our diplomatists say to Russia, that no matter what provocation she
has received, we cannot permit her to resent the injuries, lest she may
come in contact with us in India, they may expect to be reminded how,
and how lately, those possessions have come into our hands. If we plead,
as with some truth we may, that we have been obliged to extend our
territory in India by the weakness and folly of our neighbours, the
Russians may reasonably be allowed to yield in the same manner, under
the pressure of a similar necessity.

If, however, our Indian possessions are endangered by the progress of
the Russian power southward—though it is not very apparent that this
effect would be produced even by the advance of the Russians to
Constantinople—it is by precautions in India itself that we should take
measures for our security; not by embarking in a general war in Europe.
India, if our power there be consolidated and well managed, has within
itself sufficient means of defence. It will fall, like that of the
Turks, if it deserves to fall—if it become Edition: current; Page: [666]
feeble and odious, and then only; for the people subject to the British
dominion in India are probably twice as many as those of the whole
Russian Empire.6

So wrote the Globe when the Tories were in power. The withdrawal of the
fleets of France and England, to Malta and Toulon, has strengthened the
supposition that there will be no interruption of peace.

The National newspaper has declared itself defunct, from the close of
the year 1833;7 and, with the 1st of January, 1834, M. Armand Carrel,
its principal editor, assisted by the same body of writers as before,
has commenced a new daily paper, entitled Le National de 1834.

The object of this proceeding is to escape from some of the effects of a
most profligate sentence recently passed upon the National by the Cour
Royale of Paris, and confirmed by the Court of Cassation.8 The whole
story throws so much light upon the spirit in which justice is
administered in France in political cases that we shall relate it at
length for the edification of our readers.

The French Government have long smarted under the numerous failures
which they have experienced in their attempts to crush by the arm of the
law all public writers who are hostile to them. Out of upwards of eighty
prosecutions against the Tribune, they have obtained verdicts in no more
than ten or twelve; and the vindictive severity of the sentences which
have been passed by the Judges in that small number of cases, together
with the endless vexation and expense which the detestable Code
d’Instruction Criminelle has enabled them to inflict upon the accused in
all the cases, previously to the trial,9 have not seemed to them
sufficient atonement for being frustrated of the ultimate aim of so
large a majority of the prosecutions. Their disappointment and
irritation have found a vent in various ways; one of which, though not
immediately to our present purpose, we shall state. M. Persil,
Procureur-Général for the Cour Royale, in the speech which, according to
custom, he delivered when the Court resumed its sittings after the
vacation,10 proclaimed the necessity of new laws to facilitate verdicts
of condemnation in political cases; and, in particular, expressed his
hope that the legislature would enact that jurors should vote by ballot,
without any previous consultation with one another; and that a bare
majority, not as at present a majority of eight to four, should be
requisite for conviction. To the extent of this last proposition M.
Persil was warmly supported by the Journal des Débats11 Edition:
current; Page: [667] and the other Ministerial papers; and a paltry
paper, called the Moniteur du Commerce, either from the excess of its
zeal, or at the suggestion of powerful persons who wished by throwing up
a feather to ascertain the strength of the wind, went the length of
declaring a jury to be altogether an absurd institution in political
cases, and expressing a wish that the article which establishes it,
might be erased from the Charter.12 All these indications of an intended
inroad upon almost the only check upon tyranny which the French possess,
excited a disgust which appears to have prevented the prosecution of
whatever projects may have been meditated by the Government: and even in
so timid and compliant a body as the Chamber of Deputies, this feeling
has manifested itself in the debate on the Address, with a strength to
which the Government will be under the necessity of giving way.

Another shift to which Louis Philippe has been driven in order to wreak
that vengeance upon his political enemies in which he has found himself
unable to induce juries to participate with him, is to stretch to the
utmost all those provisions of the law by which the Court is permitted,
from any peculiarity of circumstances, to withdraw a cause from the
cognizance of a jury. This is the device which has been put in practice
against the National. That journal having undergone ten prosecutions, in
every one of which it had been acquitted, it appeared clear to Louis
Philippe that there were no means of making its proprietors and writers
feel the consequences of his resentment but by means of the judges
alone, who he well knew would cheerfully consent to be his tools,
although juries would not.

There exists in the French law an enactment, an absurd one enough, which
enables the Court to convict and pass sentence for offences of the
press, without a jury, provided the criminated passages occur in a
report of their own proceedings.13 Thus it is when the cause is their
own that they are empowered to be the sole judges in it. Now it so fell
out, that on the occasion of the celebrated trial relating to
Mademoiselle Boury and the pistol plot, the National, not in its report
of the trial but in its leading article, made some severe strictures on
the conduct of the judges.14 Hereupon the Cour Royale, at that time
presided over by a man named Duboys, commonly called Duboys d’Angers,
(we name this sycophant because he, with many others of his kind, helps
to compose the Edition: current; Page: [668] Government majority in the
Chamber of Deputies,) had the audacious profligacy to decide that the
leading article of the National, containing remarks on the trial, was a
report of the trial; passing over the real report, which stood in
another column of the same newspaper, and which was not in any respect
criminated. By this creditable proceeding the article in the National
was brought within the enactment which empowers the judges to pass
sentence without the verdict of a jury;15 and they proceeded to inflict
upon the responsible manager of the paper the penalties of fine and
imprisonment, and upon the paper itself that of an interdiction from
giving any reports of judicial proceedings for a period of two years.16

All the world knows what to think of a law which empowers a court of
justice, at its own discretion, to impose silence on any voice which has
once been raised in condemnation of its proceedings. That a country is
under such a law is quite enough to prove that the whole spirit of its
Government must be that of arbitrary power. The legality of the decision
was called in question by the proprietors of the National;17 but it was
confirmed by the supreme law authority, the Court of Cassation, in every
point except one: in one respect, indeed, the Court of Cassation decided
that the Court below had exceeded its powers; that it had a right to
interdict only from reporting its own proceedings, but not those of any
other tribunal.18

The Cour Royale of Paris, however, is almost the only tribunal whose
proceedings a Paris newspaper (except those which devote themselves
exclusively to judicial proceedings) usually has occasion to report. The
National, therefore, was arbitrarily precluded from furnishing to its
subscribers, pursuantly to its contract with them, one of the most
important articles of intelligence which a daily newspaper professes and
undertakes to supply. In many cases such a sentence would amount to an
entire—in all cases to a partial—confiscation of the property in the
newspaper.

In order to frustrate the intentions of their oppressors, the
proprietors of the National have dissolved their partnership, and a new
partnership having been formed, a new paper has been established, to
which the iniquitous interdiction put by the Cour Royale upon its
defunct predecessor will not apply.

M. Paulin, who for three years has so worthily filled the office of
gérant, or responsible proprietor of the National, remains under the
interdiction, and is thus disqualified from filling his old office in
the new paper. M. Carrel has in consequence come forward personally, and
in conjunction with MM. Arnold Edition: current; Page: [669] Scheffer
and Prosper Conseil,19 has assumed the legal responsibility of the
journal, of which he will be, as he was of its predecessor, the editor
and principal writer. A paper which appears under such auspices cannot
fail of brilliant success.

M. Carrel is incontestably, and by the admission even of his political
enemies, one of the first living ornaments of his country, as a mere
writer, and stands almost alone among the journalists of France in being
at an infinite distance on the one hand from any compromise with bad
institutions or established errors, and, on the other, from any
exaggeration or impatience in his schemes of social improvement; he is
no less unrivalled in the union of vigour and audacity with dignity and
moderation in the style and tone of his writings.

M. Scheffer is known to those who have attended to the political history
of the last twenty years in France, by his able co-operation with MM.
Comte and Dunoyer in the Censeur Européen, the first periodical work
which, after the return of the Bourbons, again raised the standard of
reflecting and philosophic liberalism. M. Conseil, known as the
translator of Jefferson’s Correspondence, and the author of the able
résumé of the principles of enlightened republicanism which stands
prefixed to the translation,20 is a young lawyer of great acquirements
as a jurist and economist, and versed to a degree extremely rare among
Frenchmen, in the best English philosophy.

Since the above article was written, we have learned that M. Carrel is
already prosecuted for violating the order of the Court, by inserting
reports of its proceedings in the new paper.21 M. Carrel had the
authority of eminent lawyers for maintaining that by the course he has
adopted, he has set himself free from the interdiction. But he will be
tried by the Court without a jury; and that subservient body will
scarcely fail to give Louis Philippe the intense satisfaction of
inflicting the penalty of imprisonment upon one of the most formidable
of his political enemies.

The judgment will be subject to the revision of the Court of Cassation,
which has on one memorable occasion afforded a spirited example of
resistance to the Court by refusing to sanction the sentences of the
Courts Martial after the insurrection in June, 1832.22 But this apparent
patriotism and disinterestedness are unfortunately explained by the fact
that the Court of Cassation is principally Edition: current; Page: [670]
composed of Carlists. In a cause between Louis Philippe and a republican
journal, they will join even with the wrong King to put down, by
whatever means, the men who are for no King at all; and their decision
in this case, whatever it be,23 cannot be a more profligate perversion
of the law than their confirmation of the former sentence.


233.: FRENCH NEWS [85]
 EXAMINER, 26 JAN., 1834, PP. 56-7

Promised in No. 230, this continuation of the series beginning with No.
226 is listed in the Somerville College set of the Examiner, as “Article
on the Société des Droits de l’Homme,” with one correction: at 672.32
“constitution” is altered to “institution”. The part here included is
the fifth section of the news under the heading “London, January 26,
1834,” and is clearly the part intended by Mill’s listing in the
Somerville College set of the Examiner, the identification being
confirmed by his quotation of most of it in his “The Monster Trial” in
the Monthly Repository for June 1835 (see CW, Vol. XX, pp. 123-9);
however, the second section in this part of the Examiner, a sentence
promising what Mill delivered in No. 235, may also be his. It reads:
“There have been some interesting proceedings in the French Chamber of
Deputies, but as their interest is rather of a permanent than of an
immediate character, we shall defer any comments upon them till next
week.” In the variant notes recording the differences between this text
and the quotation from it in “The Monster Trial,” the latter is
indicated by “35”.

athe société des droits de l’homme is at present the hobgoblin or
bugbear of the juste milieu. The language and manner of the partizans of
Louis Philippe with respect to that association are a curious medley of
affected contempt and intense personal hatred, not without an admixture
of fear. They are constantly and studiously imputing to the members of
the society, the absurdest opinions and the most criminal purposes; they
are incessantly averring, with a degree of emphasis which betrays a
lurking doubt, that those opinions and purposes are abhorred by the
French people, and that the society has not and never will have the
support of any class whatever, even the lowest. Yet, in the very same
breath in which they declare it to be harmless by reason of its
insignificance, they proclaim it so mischievous and so formidable that
society is certain to perish unless it be put down, by whatever means.

In truth the alarmists are equally wrong in both feelings, whether the
feelings be sincere or affected. This much-talked-of association is not
to be despised, neither, on the other hand, is it to be feared. It does
not aim at subverting society, and society would be too strong for it if
it did. Were we to believe some people, the edifice of society is so
tottering and its foundations so unstable, that a breath Edition:
current; Page: [671] is enough to blow it down; nay, there cannot be any
stir in the surrounding atmosphere, nor any knocking upon the ground,
without its certain destruction. But we have another idea of society
than this; for us it is something more steady and solid than a house of
cards. The evil we are apprehensive of is stagnation, not movement; we
can anticipate nothing in the present age but good, from the severest,
from even the most hostile scrutiny of the first principles of the
social union. Instead of expecting society to fall to pieces, our fear
is lest (the old creeds, which formerly gave to the established order of
things a foundation in men’s consciences, having become obsolete) the
fabric should mechanically hold together by the mere instinctive action
of men’s immediate personal interests, without any basis of moral
conviction at all. Rather than see this we should prefer to see the
whole of the working classes speculatively Owenites, or Saint Simonians.
We are not frightened at anti-property doctrines. We have no fear that
they should ever prevail so extensively as to be dangerous. But we have
the greatest fear lest the classes possessed of property should
degenerate more and more into selfish, unfeeling Sybarites, receiving
from society all that society can give and rendering it no service in
return, content to let the numerical majority remain sunk in mental
barbarism and physical destitution.a All experience justifies us in the
conviction that unless the ruling few can be made and kept “uneasy,”1
the many need expect no good; and nothing will make the few uneasy but
fears for the security of their property. We are well content,
therefore, that there should be cause for such fears. We have no
anti-property doctrines ourselves, and therefore cannot honestly give
such doctrines any encouragement. But we are quite satisfied that their
promulgation has a most salutary effect.

The Society of the Rights of Man cannot, however, be said to have put
forward any anti-property doctrines; and nothing can be more absurdly
calumnious than the accusations of confiscation, agrarian law, &c., &c.
If opinions adverse to the present constitution of property are secretly
held by any of the able and accomplished men who guide the proceedings
of the association, (which is certainly not to be believed on the
evidence of their enemies,) they have not put forward any such opinions.
They profess, indeed, democratic republicanism in its fullest extent;
and are far more impatient, and willing to take more violent means for
obtaining the form of government which they desire, than the more
moderate of the Republicans would approve. But on the subject of
property they have advanced no doctrines but such as, to an Englishman,
sound like the merest truisms; and that these should have been
considered dangerous in Edition: current; Page: [672] France, only shows
how little peril there is lest in that country anti-property doctrines
should ever prevail.

bThe cassociationc some months ago embodied their principles on the
subject of property in the form of a manifesto, along with which they
republished, as a compendium of their opinions, a Declaration of the
Rights of Man, which was proposed by Robespierre2 to the National
Convention to be prefixed to their Republican constitution, and was by
that body rejected. The name of Robespierre was well calculated to
excite a prejudice against this document, but any thing more harmless
than its contents can scarcely be conceived. Such, however, was not the
impression of the Parisian public. The writer of this was at Paris when
the document made its appearance, and he well remembers his astonishment
at the nature and intensity of the sentiments it appeared to excite.
Those who did not deem it too contemptible to be formidable, were filled
with consternation. The Government party, the Carlists, the Liberals,
were unanimous in crying anarchy and confusion; even Republicans shook
their heads and said “This is going too far.” And what does the reader
imagine was the proposition which appeared so startling and so alarming
to all parties? It was no other than the definition which, in the
Robespierrian declaration of rights, was given of the “right of
property;” and ran as follows:

“The right of property is the right which every one possesses of using
and enjoying the portion of wealth which is guaranteed to him by the
law.” (La portion de biens qui lui est garantie par la loi.)3

Such is the superstitious, or rather idolatrous character of the respect
for property in France, that this proposition actually appeared an
alarming heresy, was denounced with the utmost acrimony by all the
enemies of the propounders, and timidly and hesitatingly excused rather
than vindicated by their friends. The maxim was evidently too much for
all parties, it was a doctrine considerably in advance of them; even
Republicans required some time to make up their minds. Ardent
revolutionists, men who were ready to take up arms at five minutes’
notice for the subversion of the existing dynasty, doubted whether they
could admit as a speculative truth, that property is not of natural
right, but of human institution, and is the creature of law. Truly,
there is little fear for the safety of property in France. We believe
that in no country in the world, not even the Edition: current; Page:
[673] United States of America, is property so secure; the most violent
convulsion would not endanger it; in a country where nearly two-thirds
of the male adult population possess property in land, and where the
notions entertained of the inviolability of property are so pedantic and
(if we may be permitted the expression) so prudish, that there are
persons who will gravely maintain that the State has no right to make a
road through a piece of land without the owner’s consent, even on
payment of compensation.

Strange as it may appear in the declaration of rights, drawn up by
Robespierre, and adopted by the Société des Droits de l’Homme, there is
not, with the one exception which we have mentioned, one single
proposition on the subject of property, which was considered
exceptionable even by those who were so scandalized at the above
definition. No limitation of the right of property was hinted at; no new
or alarming maxim promulgated; unless such be implied in the recognition
of the principle of the English Poor Laws, that society is bound to
provide subsistence and work for its indigent members; and this document
was rejected by the Convention, by the body which put to death Louis
XVI, and created the Revolutionary Tribunal, rejected by that body as
anarchical. Yet there are people who believe that the principle of the
French Revolution was spoliation of property! For the thousandth time,
we say to the English Tories and Whigs, that they are as utterly
ignorant of the French revolution as of the revolutions among the
inhabitants of the moon. Acts of injustice were done; rights which
really partook of the nature of property, were not always treated as
such; but the respect of the revolutionary assemblies for all that they
considered as entitled to the name of property, amounted to actual
narrowness and dbigotry; wed do not affirm this solely of the
comparatively moderate and enlightened men who composed the constituent
Assembly, but in even a greater degree of the violent revolutionists of
the Convention, to whose obtuser and less cultivated intellects such a
prejudice was more natural. In the height of the reign of terror,
anti-property doctrines would have been scouted, even more decidedly
than now; no one dared avow them for fear of the guillotine, nor do such
doctrines figure in the history of the revolution at all, save in the
solitary instance of the conspiracy of Baboeuf,4 greatly posterior to
the fall of Robespierre and the Montagne.b

In so far as the Society of the Rights of Man contends against the
narrow and superstitious notions of property which are prevalent in
France, and gives currency to more liberal and more rational views, it
can do nothing but good; and even if the speculative truths, which it so
energetically proclaims, are intended to serve as a foundation for
practical corollaries of a more questionable character, we see no cause
for alarm; none even for regret. Without infringing the principle
Edition: current; Page: [674] of property, much remains to be done, by
morality and even by law, to render the practical working of that
principle productive of greater good to society at large: much may be
done to mitigate the inequalities of wealth which have as pernicious an
effect on those whom they seem to benefit, as upon those on whom they
apparently press hardest, and to promote all those tendencies in human
affairs which cause society to approximate to what, in the literal
sense, must always be an unattainable chimera, equality of fortunes. But
all this we have little hope to see done, until the rich shall feel that
except by making the law of property popular, they will have some
difficulty in maintaining it. Society will then only be on the most
desirable footing, when the proprietary class shall feel compelled to
make a clear case to the world in favour of the existing institutions of
society; when they shall act under an habitual sense of the necessity of
convincing the non-proprietary multitude, that the existing arrangement
of property is a real good to them as well as to the rich; and shall
feel that the most effectual way to make them think it so, is to make it
more and more so in fact.


234.: FONTANA AND PRATI’S ST. SIMONISM IN LONDON
 EXAMINER, 2 FEB., 1834, PP. 68-9

Mill probably had this review in mind, or may have even written it, by
22 Dec., 1833, when he advised Carlyle: “Of the St. Simonians next time;
vide also a forthcoming Examiner” (EL, CW, Vol. XII, p. 203). The
concluding paragraphs on marriage and divorce have a particular force
when placed in the context of his relations with Harriet Taylor at this
time, just after their sojourn in Paris; from these months also date the
companion essays they wrote on marriage (CW, Vol. XXI, pp. 35-49 and
375-7). The review, in the “Literary Examiner,” is headed “St. Simonism
in London. The Pretended Community of Goods; or, the Organization of
Industry. The Pretended Community of Women; or, Matrimony and Divorce.
By Fontana, Chief, Prati, Preacher, of the St. Simonian religion in
England.” Actually the pamphlet (London: Effingham Wilson, 1833), which
does not further identify Fontana or Prati, does not have the words “The
Pretended” before “Community of Goods” or “Community of Women.” It is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “An article on St. Simonism being a
review of the pamphlet entitled ‘St. Simonism in London’ in the Examiner
of 2d February 1834” (MacMinn, p. 38). In the Somerville College set of
the Examiner, it is listed as “Review of ‘St Simonism in London.’ ”

we notice this rather empty, though in no respect immoral pamphlet,
chiefly for the opportunity it affords us of correcting the impression
which has gone forth, that its authors are accredited missionaries of
some association or sect; the teachers of some creed, some religion, or
soi-disant religion, which is believed or professed by other persons
besides themselves. We certainly have no ground for imputing to the
individuals who are now holding themselves forth as St. Simonian
teachers, the assumption of any character which does not belong to
Edition: current; Page: [675] them: they have no connexion with any
society or body of persons at Paris, but it may be that they do not
pretend to any. The style and tone, however, which they have adopted,
and even the title which they have given themselves, naturally suggest
such an inference, and accordingly it has almost universally been drawn.
We, therefore, though without wishing any ill to Messrs. Fontana and
Prati,1 think it but right to state, that they are not the authorised
representatives of the St. Simonian Society, nor would have been at all
likely to be selected as such by the Society if it still existed.2 It
had, moreover, ceased to exist, before the young man named Fontana made
his appearance in this country. He was sent by no one, had credentials
from no one; and after considerable personal inquiry, we have not been
able to ascertain that he ever was an acknowledged member of the St.
Simonian body, or is known personally to any one of the remarkable men
from whom St. Simonism has derived its celebrity. The case is otherwise
with Dr. Prati, who has long resided in this country, and who did occupy
a place, though never a high one, in the St. Simonian society; but who
occupies it no longer, because the society is dissolved.

After casting upon the stormy waters of discussion a greater number of
interesting and instructive ideas than have been sent forth to the
French public since Rousseau, ideas too of which the profound are not
less profound, and the absurd and exaggerated far less absurd and
exaggerated, than his; after literally educating a large proportion of
the most promising among the youth of the instructed classes in
France,—teaching them the lesson which is learnt only once, and from
error as often as from truth, viz., to think; after doing all this in
the short space of about three years, the St. Simonian religion shared
the fate of all religions which profess to be founded on reason: the
reason of the different members of the sect, was found to conflict; the
divergency of opinion which arose, shook the faith of all in the
infallibility of their system, and the sect disbanded itself. To have
been hurried by a generous enthusiasm into any vagaries, however strange
or absurd, does no permanent injury, in France, to any man’s reputation
or prospects in life, when once the delusion is over. The twenty or
thirty individuals who were most conspicuous in the sect, have mostly
(as all Edition: current; Page: [676] expected who knew the attainments
and powers of the men) stepped at once into the very first rank of the
several professions or careers which they have since embraced, or to
which they have returned. Having renounced all that was bad in their
late creed, and generally held fast to all (and there was much) which
was good in it; many of them are now exercising, through the press and
otherwise, a powerful and highly beneficial influence over the public
mind of France. But there is not now remaining at Paris one single
individual who calls himself a St. Simonian, or adheres to what was St.
Simonism—while St. Simonism was either as a religion or as a philosophy.
The late chief and founder of the sect, Enfantin, has quitted France,
and gone into Egypt, with the two or three members of the association
who still adhere to him, to instruct Mehemet Ali, not in the doctrines
of his religion, but how to restore the canal which formerly connected
the Red Sea with the Mediterranean.3 We believe that these two Italians,
Messrs. Fontana and Prati, are, if not the only St. Simonians extant,
the only professed apostles of St. Simonism. It may perhaps be thought
that a name which has been dropped by all who held it, belongs of right
to those who chuse to pick it up. But if Messrs. Fontana and Prati think
fit to hoist the standard of a sect which is extinct, and to identify
themselves (as far as names go) with a religious and political system
which, though now defunct, once numbered among its adherents men vastly
their superiors in talents and attainments; they must expect to be told
that nobody besides themselves is responsible for any of their
proceedings; and that St. Simonism was a far better thing than it would
be supposed if these, its surviving apostles, were considered as a fair
sample of all that it could produce.

We have thought it necessary to say thus much, because an impotent
attempt, by persons altogether unequal to the task, to fight up a lost
cause, is likely to bring discredit upon any truths which, with their
nerveless hands, they may attempt to do battle for. The novelties in
opinion, broached by the St. Simonian Society, came before the French
public in conjunction with evidences of high intellectual powers; and
therefore commanded the attention, and even gained the respect, of
almost all thinking and disinterested persons, (whatever might be their
creed,) who were not religious or philosophical fanatics. But similar
opinions thrust into notice here, in a manner which associates them, not
with mental power but with mental poverty and weakness, can have no
effect but to strengthen the prejudice against all who question
established opinions, and Edition: current; Page: [677] increase the
cowardice which makes people shrink from exercising their reason on some
of the most important questions of legislation and morality.

The St. Simonians are supposed by most of those who have heard of them
only through these self-constituted representatives, to be an obscure
knot of senseless visionaries, or designing knaves, who inculcate, as
the Times says, “community of goods and community of women; in other
words, universal profligacy and universal plunder.”4 If such were the
fact, is it likely that the second man in the sect, the editor and
principal writer of their very able and interesting journal Le Globe,
would have been released from prison before his sentence had expired,
and immediately selected by the Government for an important mission to
the United States?5 That another of their leading men6 would have been
appointed one of the principal editors of the Constitutionnel, eminently
the journal of the cautious and timid part of the middle class, those
who are most shocked at all eccentricities, whether of opinion or
conduct? That many who had quitted the service of Government to become
apostles of the new creed, would on their abandonment of it have been at
once restored to the rank they previously held in the various
departments of the administration? That the financial and commercial
articles of almost all the principal newspapers, both in Paris and the
provinces, and all the articles of the only Review of a high
philosophical character now existing in France,7 would be, as they are,
written either by ex-St. Simonians, or by persons whose intellects have
been formed chiefly by the St. Simonians? There is scarcely a thinker of
any importance, in France, at the present moment, who is not largely
indebted to St. Simonism; and many have the candour fully to acknowledge
the obligation. Nor would it be easy to find a parallel in history to
the striking improvement which, aided no doubt by the circumstances of
the times, the St. Simonians have introduced into the whole character of
public discussion in France.

The St. Simonians neither advocated community of goods nor community of
women. They did advocate doctrines of a peculiar kind, both with respect
to property and marriage. On both subjects they laid down many just and
valuable speculative premises, while on neither were their practical
conclusions defensible; and the doctrines of some of them relative to
marriage created the schism which ultimately broke up the sect. On the
subject of property, the system Edition: current; Page: [678] they
advocated, was the extension to the whole nation of that kind of
“community of goods,” and no other, which already exists in the
management of the Bank of England or the East India Company; a sort of
joint-stock management of the entire productive resources of the nation:
the land, and all the instruments of production, being the property of
the State, (as is the case with land already in the East,) and the
produce not being apportioned as in Mr. Owen’s parallelograms, in equal
shares to the industrious and the idle,8 but distributed among the
different members of the community on the principle that no one who does
not work either with head or hands, shall be allowed to eat, and that
each person shall be employed according to his capacity, and paid by a
salary proportioned as far as possible to his services, as is now
supposed to be the case in the army, or in a public office. A scheme,
impracticable indeed—but differing from Owenism, and from every other
Utopia we ever read of, in this, that the impracticability is only in
degree, not in kind; and that while most other visionary projects for
reforming society are not only impossible, but if possible, would be
bad, this plan, if it could be realized, would be good. It is the true
ideal of a perfect human society; the spirit of which will more and more
pervade even the existing social institutions, as human beings become
wiser and better; and which, like any other model of unattainable
perfection, everybody is the better for aspiring to, although it be
impossible to reach it. We may never get to the north star, but there is
much use in turning our faces towards it if we are journeying northward.
As civilization has advanced, the principle of combination of labour has
come into perpetually greater play; and associations for purposes of
productive industry have become practicable, and been actually realized,
on a continually enlarging scale. We have only to imagine the same
progression indefinitely continued, and a time would come when St.
Simonism would be practicable; and if practicable, desirable.

As for the pretended “community of women;” were such really the opinion
maintained, though a barbarous, and, so far as such an epithet can be
applied to opinions, an immoral doctrine, it is not necessarily a
licentious or sensual one: it may be connected, as it was in Plato, with
a rigid, though an indefensible system of morality;9 and may be the
result of a train of philosophical speculation, pushed to its extreme
consequences. But the doctrine of the St. Simonians, as all know who are
really acquainted with it, was objectionable on a directly contrary
ground; instead of leaving too much license, it left none at all; it
encroached far more than even our present institutions and customs, upon
human freedom, and spontaneity of choice; for it made both marriage and
divorce depend upon Edition: current; Page: [679] circumstances, of
which others, and not the parties themselves, were to be the judges.
Their’s was a system much nearer to despotism than to licentiousness, or
even rational liberty. Their absurdities on this subject are, however,
forgotten, and the memory of them shall not, by us, be revived. But we
are at a loss to see how the accusation of immorality can lie against
the only doctrine which, if we may judge from their pamphlet, Messrs.
Fontana and Prati maintain with respect to the marriage contract—its
dissolubility. Surely this is an opinion which it is open to
conscientious persons to entertain and advocate, without deserving to be
treated as the very scum of the earth—looked down upon even by the
Literary Gazette!10 Surely the accusation of grossness, if applicable
any where, may with far greater reason be retorted against the morality
at present in vogue. But the same persons who pronounce that to be
immoral and irreligious which Milton deemed essential to morality and
religion11—the same persons who pronounce that to be inconsistent with
the good order of society, which is the law of the land in all or almost
all Protestant Germany—can see no sensuality, no indelicacy, in the
continuance of a merely animal connexion between two persons who have
become conscious that affection has never existed, or has ceased to
exist between them. For our part, our difficulty is to conceive how a
people, whose current morality countenances or tolerates such a debasing
prostitution, can dare to call any doctrines or practices gross or
licentious.

To the impure, all things are impure:12 a sensualist, let him hold what
opinion he may, will hold it in a sensual spirit: to such, marriage as
it now exists, is but a guarantee of exclusive property in an instrument
of sensual gratification. The most unlimited freedom of divorce could
engender no feeling viler than this. But unlimited freedom is not what
we contend for. It might be suitable to a people among whom personal
profligacy is rare; but in the present state of European society, the
degree of latitude allowed must be limited by the varying probability of
its being abused for purposes of sensuality, or exercised in mere
caprice. We think that divorce should be always pronounced by the
Magistrate, in cases defined with more or less strictness according to
circumstances, but in which the attempt should be to include all those
instances, and no others, in which, after ample trial, the union had
obviously and decidedly failed to attain the purposes for which it has
been ordained: the interests of children being, of course, always
reckoned as part of the account. If in any country, under such a system
as this, marriage (as is pretended) would degenerate into a mere
temporary concubinage, the state of opinion in that country must be such
as would permit the utmost latitude of profligacy, whatever were
nominally the law.

Edition: current; Page: [680]
But this is too grave a subject, and of too far-reaching an interest, to
be disposed of incidentally. Unless we greatly err, a time will come,
and soon, when the discussion of it will assume a more serious aspect,
and will be conducted on far loftier principles than heretofore. It is a
question of the deepest concernment to all who feel interested in the
moral and social condition of women; who, it is contended on the one
hand, would be degraded, if marriage were rendered dissoluble; while the
very ground upon which the dissolubility is defended on the other, is
that it is the only means by which woman can be elevated in the social
scale. The natural consequence of greater freedom in respect to the
dissolution of marriage would be that women, like men, would be either
provided for by their parents, or taught to provide for themselves; that
they would no longer be under a kind of moral necessity of allying
themselves to some man; and would become, what they have never yet been,
really the equals of men. Because it is part of the perfection of woman
to be dependent, as it is of the perfection of man too, (dependent, we
mean, for affection, a dependence, which is, as all dependence ought to
be, reciprocal,) is it therefore right that women should hold their
subsistence, and their estimation in society at the will of a man? So
long as most women depend for actual support, and all for preserving
their reputation, upon keeping upon good terms, coûte qu’il coûte, with
their husband, while he, affection apart, depends upon his wife for
nothing but sitting at the head of his table, or looking after his
servants, the ordinary relation between husband and wife can be no other
than that of a helpless dependent towards, at best, an affectionate
master, at worst, a cruel tyrant. And with respect to the other side of
the question, we do not think he can be a man of much fineness of
character, who can greatly value any hold that convention can give him
over affections which he believes would, if the customs of society
permitted, be transferred elsewhere.

the french chamber of deputies has, so far as depends upon itself,
disposed of two important subjects—the municipal constitution of Paris1
and the question of entails.2

Edition: current; Page: [681]
The local affairs of every commune or township, and of every department
of France, are managed, to a certain extent, by a body, termed in the
former case the Municipal, in the latter, the departmental council.
Under the empire and the restoration these bodies were named by the
Crown, but laws have been enacted since the revolution of 1830,
providing for their election in a mode partaking, though in different
degrees, of the nature of a popular choice; the electors of the
municipal councils, amounting for all France to about one million, those
of the departmental councils to about two hundred thousand only.3

Paris was excepted from these enactments, its local administration being
reserved to be regulated by a separate Act; and a Bill was accordingly
introduced by the Government, which has now passed the Chamber of
Deputies. Its provisions are a fresh exemplification of the close spirit
of oligarchical monopoly, which pervades all the constituted authorities
of France. Paris composing nearly the whole of the department of the
Seine, the same body which acts as a municipal council for the affairs
of that city, serves also (with the addition of two or three members
from St. Denis and Sceaux) as a council for the general affairs of the
department.

This system being adhered to in the new Bill, it consequently became
necessary to determine whether the members whom Paris is to elect for
this twofold purpose, should be chosen by the small number of electors
who would fall to the share of Paris, under the provisions of the
Departmental Law, or by the more extensive constituency which the
Municipal Law would provide. Having this alternative, the Chamber of
course made its election for oligarchy. The Departmental Law was the
model preferred: and while every other town and every village in France
has now the managers of its local affairs elected by something like a
really popular system of election, the capital alone is placed under the
management of a narrow and exclusive privileged class.

The other Bill which has just gone through the Chamber, without
opposition, is of a more democratic character, and will scarcely be
allowed to pass the other House. When Buonaparte determined to force an
aristocracy, vainly and ignorantly expecting that the pretty exotic
would be of as much service to his bad Government as it had been found
by other Governments, where it was of spontaneous growth, he so far set
aside the law of the equal partibility of property on the death of the
proprietor, as to allow the creation of entails (majorats) to accompany
a title of nobility, and a considerable number of these majorats have
since been created.4

These, if the Bill passes the Chamber of Peers, will be set aside, (due
regard Edition: current; Page: [682] being had to rights already
acquired,) and the future creation of majorats interdicted.

The adoption of this measure, entirely unopposed by an assembly so
anti-popular in its general policy, is a striking illustration of the
peculiar character of the democratic feeling in France. It is not true,
as is often asserted, that the French are lovers of “equality,” in the
true sense of the term. There is not a people in Europe more greedy of
distinction than themselves; or more ready to do homage to it in others,
so long as it is merely personal distinction. But they cannot endure the
shadow of a hereditary privilege; an advantage marked out for a
particular caste, and not accessible to the remainder of the community.
In studying French affairs, this observation will be found a necessary
key to much. In this latter sense the passion for equality so pervades
the nation, that even the bourgeois oligarchs of the Chamber of Deputies
are as completely possessed by it as other people. Hence the abolition
of the hereditary peerage, the abolition of majorats, and much else.

intense interest has been excited at Paris by the duel in which M.
Dulong, a Republican Member of the Chamber of Deputies, has sacrificed
his life.1 There is the strongest reason to believe that this
catastrophe has been occasioned, not by the resentment of the offended
party, Gen. Bugeaud, who is said to have shown himself well disposed to
an accommodation, but by the vindictiveness of Louis-Philippe. M. Dulong
had written a letter of apology which M. Bugeaud had considered
satisfactory, and the quarrel was believed to have terminated; but a
paragraph appeared next day in a Government paper, giving to the act of
retractation a colour so dishonourable to M. Dulong, that he felt
himself obliged Edition: current; Page: [683] to recall it; and when,
immediately before the fatal meeting, he demanded back his letter from
M. de Rumigny, one of his opponent’s seconds, who is aide-de-camp to the
King, it was not forthcoming.2 This M. de Rumigny (the same who acted
the part of a police spy in getting up the charge of conspiracy against
MM. Cavaignac, Guinard, and others, three years since) has subsequently
admitted that the letter was at the Tuilleries, and that he destroyed it
in the presence of the King, Louis-Philippe is thus publicly and
undeniably implicated in the affair, and nobody seems to doubt that it
was he who caused the insertion of the offensive newspaper paragraph in
order to produce a renewal of the quarrel.

The funeral procession of M. Dulong was attended by a concourse of
people, exceeding, it is said, even the assemblage at the funeral of
Gen. Lamarque. Not an act of disorder, nor an intemperate word, occurred
to furnish the police with an excuse for massacring the people. The
impression made upon public opinion by the whole affair is said to be
such as Louis-Philippe’s greatest enemies would desire.

The French Government has taken a leaf out of the book of the
Castlereagh Ministry. It has proposed the introduction into France of
one of the Six Acts.3 A Bill has been introduced for the suppression of
cheap political publications.4 For some months past there has been
growing up in Paris a class of periodical and other tracts, sold by
hawkers in the streets, at a price within the reach of the working
people, to whom, principally, they are addressed. These publications are
mostly republican. The object of the Bill now introduced is, first to
require all venders of such publications to take out a license from the
police; and next, to subject the works themselves to a stamp.

We shall watch the progress of this Bill. There is no doubt that it will
pass; for public opinion is not yet sufficiently advanced among the
French, to maintain any struggle in behalf of freedom of discussion for
its own sake, when they take no personal or party interest in those who
are the victims of its infringement. The proposed law will be considered
a measure against the republican press; and, consequently, nobody who is
not a republican, will deem himself concerned in opposing it.

Edition: current; Page: [684]
The Commission on the Budget is said to make some difficulties about the
estimates, and it is even pretended that they will refuse to grant the
increased military force which Marshal Soult demands.5 This we take the
liberty to doubt; a timid and irresolute body like the present Chamber,
always succumbs to obstinacy, and Louis-Philippe has more of that
quality than any man who has held power in France since Napoleon.

M. Dupont de l’Eure has been induced by affliction for the fate of his
near relative and friend, M. Dulong,2 as well as by the disappointment
of the hopes which he entertained in common with so many others from the
Revolution of 1830, to resign his seat in the Chamber of Deputies. This
loss, therefore, must be added to those which the Chamber sustained from
the same feelings of discouragement last year; by the resignation of two
of its worthiest members—MM. Thouvenel and Laguette Mornay.

College set of the Examiner as “Article on France.”

the bill relating to public criers has passed the Chamber of Peers in
one sitting, has received the Royal assent, and is now law.1 On the day
on which it came into force, there was not a riot, but sufficient crowd
in the streets, to give the police an excuse for some of their usual
acts of brutal outrage.

The French government are so pleased with their easy success in passing
this Bill, that they have announced another for the suppression of
Political Associations.2 If this should pass, they have probably another
ready for the restriction of the province of Jury Trial, in political
cases. We are too distant from the scene of action to know whether the
inducement to all these enormities be terror, because they are weak, or
because they are strong.

The Cour d’Assises has declared the National de 1834, identical with the
old National, and has sentenced M. Carrel and his coadjutor, M. Conseil,
to fine and imprisonment.3 Their last resource against this complicated
and flagrant act of persecution and tyranny, is in the Court of
Cassation; and to rely on that is, we fear, to lean on a broken reed.


239.: THE POOR LAW REPORT
 EXAMINER, 2 MAR., 1834, P. 137

Mill is here commenting on the “Report from His Majesty’s Commissioners
for Inquiring into the Administration and Practical Operation of the
Poor Laws,” which was printed in PP, 1834, XXVII, with Appendices A-F in
Vols. XXVII-XXXIX; the Report had been issued separately without the
Appendices in February. This article appears immediately after No. 238,
separated from it by a printer’s rule. See No. 240 for a fuller
discussion. It is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A paragraph on
the Poor Law Report, in the Examiner of 2d March 1834” (MacMinn, p. 38)
and listed in the Somerville College set of the Examiner as “Paragraph
on the Poor Law Report.”

Edition: current; Page: [686]
we observe that the Report of the Poor Law Commissioners will shortly be
accessible to the general public at the very low price of half-a-crown,
and we doubt if so important a mass, either of facts or of comments upon
facts, ever was attainable at so moderate a cost. We exhort all who have
that sum to expend, and in particular all who exercise any influence on
the public mind through the press, to possess themselves of the Report
itself, and read it with the care and attention which its subject
requires, and which its merits will amply repay. In the meantime we
advise them to shut their ears to whatever they may hear on the subject
from the London newspapers, which have in some cases even misstated what
the Commissioners recommend, and where they have stated it truly, have
separated it from those facts and explanations which alone can place it
in its proper light.1


240.: THE POOR LAWS
 EXAMINER, 9 MAR., 1834, PP. 145-6

For the context, see No. 239. This article is in the “Political
Examiner,” headed as title, and is described in Mill’s bibliography as
“An article headed ‘The Poor Laws’ in the Examiner of 9th March 1834”
(MacMinn, p. 38). In the Somerville College set of the Examiner, it is
listed as title.

the question of poor law amendment is so complicated in its details, and
so much care is needed in discussing it, to guard our meaning from all
sorts of perverse misunderstanding and misinterpretation, that we are
unwilling to enter into the minutiae of the subject, until we have more
thoroughly studied the Report of the Commissioners. There is no reason,
however, for not declaring at once that their investigations appear to
us to have ended in the most complete justification of the principle of
the Poor Laws, and the severest condemnation of their practice.

The principle of securing, by a legal provision, the actual necessaries
of life and health to all who cannot otherwise obtain them, we consider
as now placed out of the reach of dispute by any unprejudiced person.
Many of the wisest men have hitherto doubted of this principle, only
because they did not know, what the Commissioners have demonstrated not
by argument only, but by the most decisive specific experience, that the
effect imputed to compulsory relief, of discouraging voluntary exertion,
and promoting improvidence, may be certainly obviated by a proper
attention to the conditions on which relief is given.

These conditions, the Commissioners propose should be such as would
render Edition: current; Page: [687] the condition of the infirm and
helpless more eligible than at present, and that of the able-bodied
pauper (whose condition is now far more desirable than the situation of
the independent labourer) less eligible; and they have shown, what is of
the very utmost importance, that the able-bodied pauper may be secured
against cold and hunger, and provided with all the means of bodily
health and strength, being at the same time neither overworked nor
subjected to any other kind of bodily suffering, and may yet be in a
condition inferior to that of the labourer subsisting honestly on his
own industry. The mere privation of indulgences, and the sacrifice of so
much liberty as is given up by submitting to the discipline of a
well-regulated workhouse, are quite sufficient, if properly enforced, to
make every able-bodied pauper desire to extricate himself from
pauperism; and wherever this has been tried, all, or nearly all, the
able-bodied paupers have speedily found employment, not only without a
fall, but with an actual rise, of wages throughout the parish.

The Commissioners have in view, as an ultimate end, the abolition of
out-door relief to able-bodied paupers, but not to the aged and
helpless, nor even to the able-bodied where peculiar circumstances
require an exception; though we deem the principle so important, that we
trust exceptions will be very rarely allowed. Neither do they propose to
introduce the rule suddenly, but gradually. The Times must have read
their Report very carelessly, or it could not have taken up, and
communicated to its readers the impression that all the relieved poor
were to be brought into workhouses.1

The writer in the Times is in complete contradiction to himself. He
begins by admitting that the condition of the pauper must be made
inferior to that of the independent labourer, and then raises the cry of
inhumanity against the only possible means by which this can be done. To
bring a poor family into the workhouse, he says, is to make their
poverty a disgrace. We answer, it is simply to make their poverty known,
or rather to make the fact known that they are living upon the labour of
others. If this is objected to, how is the condition of the pauper to be
made inferior to that of the independent labourer? It cannot be by
starving him! Yet that is the alternative to which the sentimentality of
the Times would reduce us. If living upon parish relief is to be made
desirable, there is no more to be said. But why set out with proclaiming
that it is to be made undesirable, and then object to the means
proposed, because they really have that effect? In America the
independent labourer is so well off, that by merely giving to the
applicant for relief less money than the ordinary wages of labour, you
would give him a strong motive to cease to be a pauper as soon as he
could get work. But here, the independent labourer earns so little, that
you cannot give the pauper less; you can only give him that little on
harder terms. If it be given at his own dwelling he is made better off
than the independent labourer, because he Edition: current; Page: [688]
will, in that case, whatever you may attempt to the contrary, do less
work for it. In the workhouse, and the workhouse alone, can the bodily
wants of the pauper be amply cared for, and yet pauperism be rendered
not shameful (that is not the object), but undesirable.

the french government has introduced the threatened measure against
Political Societies.1 All such Associations, if exceeding the number of
nineteen persons, were already illegal;2 but many of them evaded the law
by subdividing themselves into smaller Societies, not exceeding the
lawful number of members. The present law is intended to meet this
evasion. Our prophecy of last week has been more than verified: this
very Bill sets aside Jury trial.3 It provides that all infractions of
itself shall be tried before the Tribunal of Correctional Police, which
decides without a Jury. The reason is, that Paris Juries always acquit
persons who are prosecuted for this offence.

Truly there was no very urgent necessity for dispensing with Juries; for
if these men obtain a verdict once in twelve times, the sentence in that
one case makes ample amends for the eleven failures. M. Cabet, a Member
of the Chamber of Deputies, having been found guilty of a libel on the
King, in a Newspaper of which he is editor and proprietor, has been
sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and privation of “civil rights” for
two years more.4 By this he loses his seat in the Chamber, his rights as
an elector, the power of holding any public office, and even of giving
testimony in a Court of Justice, except under certain restrictions.

We have often cause to complain of English Judges, but it must be
confessed that, in comparison with the French, they are high-minded
patriots. The case of M. Carrel would prove, if it were not known
before, that there is no stretch of insolent tyranny which French Judges
are not eager to perpetrate at the bidding of power.

243.: REPLY TO DR. PRATI
 EXAMINER, 23 MAR., 1834, PP. 185-6

This article answers a letter from Prati (which was not printed and has
not been located) objecting to Mill’s comments in No. 234. The news
item, headed “London, March 23, 1834,” is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “A notice in answer to a letter from Dr. Prati, in the
Examiner of 23d March 1834” (MacMinn, p. 39). It is listed in the
Somerville College set of the Examiner as “Paragraphs on the St Simonian
Missionaries.”

we have received a letter from Dr. Prati, the St. Simonian preacher
(which from its length and the press of other matter, we are unable to
insert) in reply to that part of the article on St. Simonism in our
paper of the 2nd of February, which related to himself and his “Chief,”
M. Fontana. We had stated that M. Fontana “was sent by no one, had
credentials from no one;” and that after considerable personal inquiry,
we have not been able to ascertain that he ever was an acknowledged
member of the St. Simonian body, or is known personally to any one of
the remarkable men from whom St. Simonism has derived its celebrity. Dr.
Prati informs us, and has produced such evidence as convinces us, that
M. Fontana did belong to the St. Simonian society, and took his
departure for England with the knowledge and sanction of those members
of the society who were assembled at Ménilmontant. These facts are no
doubt of considerable importance to M. Fontana personally, and we are
glad, therefore, by publishing them, to remove any impression to his
disadvantage which may have been Edition: current; Page: [690] conceived
from our former statement. The substance, however, of our assertions
remains untouched: the same documents which prove that M. Fontana was
recognized as a teacher of St. Simonism, prove that he was not selected
as such. His departure took place at the period of a general dispersion
of the society, when all organized or concerted propagandism was
abandoned, and whosoever chose to go forth of his own accord and teach
St. Simonism, received the permission and authority of the père suprême,
M. Enfantin, to do so. M. Fontana, therefore, and not the society,
remains burthened with the responsibility of whatever discredit may
attach to the cause from the feebleness of its advocate.

Dr. Prati further informs us, that there are still St. Simonians, and
publications avowedly St. Simonian, in France, and that although the
Chief, M. Enfantin, had formally dissolved the society, he subsequently
proclaimed its resuscitation. “From on board Le Prince Héréditaire,
Sept. 22nd, 1833, he addressed a letter to all the St. Simonian family,
in which he reassumed his authority, and issued general orders to all
his followers to hold themselves in residence.”1 So far, therefore, we
stand corrected. It remains to be seen whether this resumption of the
empire after an abdication, will succeed better with M. Enfantin than it
did with the Emperor Dioclesian.2

Dr. Prati enters into some particulars of his own personal literary
history, for the purpose, apparently, of proving himself to be no
pretender: but this was altogether unnecessary as far as we are
concerned; for his name and character were honorably known to us before
St. Simonism existed: nor had we ever even a momentary thought to his
disadvantage, unless it be such to deem him inadequate to the task he
has undertaken of founding a new religion in England. “Our voice,” he
says, “begins already to penetrate the mass:” if so, he has our cordial
congratulations. He will make no proselytes but at the expense of far
worse errors.

The tone and spirit of Dr. Prati’s letter do honour to his candour and
good temper; qualities in which we cannot forbear to state, no St.
Simonian apostle was ever yet found deficient. We forgive him his
sarcasm upon ourselves, for having reserved our praises of St. Simonism
until we considered it as defunct. We reserved them until we considered
it as calumniated. If he refer to our papers of 29th January, and 9th
September 1832, he will see that we formerly expressed Edition: current;
Page: [691] ourselves on the subject of St. Simonism exactly as we do
now.3 But we did not exert ourselves to force a discussion, which we
knew would do no good either to St. Simonism or to the cause of truth.
We did not wish to draw down upon men and doctrines that we respect the
insults and calumnies which, now when the mischief is done, we are
willing and eager to join in repelling.


244.: STATE OF OPINION IN FRANCE
 EXAMINER, 30 MAR., 1834, PP. 195-6

One of Mill’s more elaborate attempts to counter what he saw as
prejudice against and ignorance of France, this leader in the “Political
Examiner,” headed as title, is described in his bibliography as “An
article headed ‘State of Opinion in France’ in the Examiner of 30th
March 1834” (MacMinn, p. 39). It is listed in the Somerville College set
of the Examiner as title. The article (except for the first and last
paragraphs) was reprinted, in translation, with an introduction, in
Revue Républicaine, 10 July, 1834, pp. 82-8, as “Opinion d’un Anglais
sur l’esprit publique en France.”

the tory publications, Blackwood’s and Fraser’s Magazines, the Quarterly
Review, and others, have frequently of late indulged in long-winded
lamentations on the state of France, which by repetition have
established a sort of claim to notice, since there is scarcely any
misrepresentation which, if it be often repeated and never contradicted,
does not find at last some persons to believe it.1 What they affirm is
in substance this—that the second French Revolution has swept away what
little of morality and religion the first had left; and instead of
producing any advances in freedom or good government, has substituted
for the mild, legal, and constitutional rule (as they term it) of the
elder Bourbons, a most oppressive though an unstable despotism. Which
proves the folly and wickedness of all revolutions, and of all attempts
of the people to control the management of their affairs.

We shall say nothing at present on the state of France in respect to
religion and morality, except that to a Tory and High Church observer,
there must naturally appear to be none; since what there is of either,
differs from his morality and religion, in most of those non-essentials
which he has been taught to consider as the essentials. We mean now to
confine ourselves to the political state of France, which is represented
as so desperate. On this subject the Tories only repeat and Edition:
current; Page: [692] exaggerate what we ourselves had said long before.
At a time when English journalists were all but unanimous in their
laudation of Louis Philippe and his principles of government, and
invective against all against whom Louis Philippe’s stipendiary press
inveighed, we alone protested against the delusion, and spoke out what
is now admitted to be the truth, with respect to the man and his system.
Yet we are firmly convinced that even now, under a government as
arbitrary, as encroaching, and as much the enemy of popular institutions
and social reforms as ever ruled in France with the forms of a
constitution, the French nation is making advances in all the most
important elements of good government and political improvement,
unparalleled at any former period of history; and that for the rapidity
of this progress she is wholly indebted to the late Revolution.

If, indeed, the beneficial results of a political convulsion are to be
estimated by the improvements which it may immediately bring about in
the institutions of a country, or the change which it may at once effect
in the spirit which pervades the Government, the French Revolution of
1830 must be pronounced a failure. But if the Three Days of July had
been as fruitful as they have hitherto been barren of this kind of
improvement, what, after all, would it have amounted to? Something
doubtless; but not much. Governments, and the acts of governments, are
in themselves no good, but merely the means of good; and not the only,
far even from being the principal, means. Governments, besides, are made
by men, and can neither be better nor worse than the men who made them.
“Governments and Constitutions,” says M. Comte in the Censeur Européen,
“create nothing—they declare what already exists.”2—A maxim false as to
the ultimate effects of any government, but true of all governments when
first established. Till they have fairly struck root, they are of
importance far more as symptoms than as causes. That the French people,
having the power, did not, in July 1830, establish a better government,
proves that the national mind was not ripe for a better: it has been
ripening since with wonderful rapidity, and its time will come.
Improvement in the government is so sure to follow, and is of so little
avail and so little likely to be durable if it precede, improvement in
the national mind, that no government, however bad in spirit, which
allows that to go on, gives much cause for regret or apprehension. And
if that best improvement, which alone renders any other great
improvement possible, be taking place as rapidly under the present men
and measures as it could under any others, the better part of all which
better men and measures could have produced, is already attained; and
the rest may be waited for, not passively, for then it would never be
had, but without any of the impatience of disappointment.

Edition: current; Page: [693]
And such we conceive to be the fact. The public mind of France is now in
a state of such rapid progress, that we question whether it could have
improved more quickly, even if a better settlement had been made of the
government in August 1830. The whole character of public discussion has
changed. The Revolution and its consequences have filled the public mind
with new ideas. That great event has set so many old questions at rest,
that room has been made for new; and has excited a spirit which would
not allow the blank to remain unfilled. It has carried discussion onward
into another field. It has finally closed the volume of the eighteenth
century, and has begun to inscribe that of the nineteenth with distinct
and durable characters.

This change, both in the questions discussed and in the spirit of
discussion, is equally visible, whether the subject be forms of
government, or those great interests of man and society to which all
questions respecting forms of government are merely subsidiary.

During the fifteen years of the Restoration, the popular party was
altogether on the defensive. Impassable limits were prescribed to
political improvement by the provisions of the Charter. To have made
profession, or even submitted to the imputation, of a desire to
introduce into France more liberal institutions than the Charter had
given, was to forfeit all chance of political influence. The Charter
itself was perpetually assailed, both covertly and indirectly; and to
defend it against the ruling power, which, being the stronger was
naturally the encroaching party, was sufficient occupation for the
friends of popular government. As they knew that they could not hope for
more than the Charter, and were never sure of retaining that, they made
it their rallying point, and allowed it to be held sacred even in those
of its provisions which they disapproved, that the Government might be
forced to observe it in those which they approved. In this defensive
position, entrenched behind a piece of parchment, there was little
demand for the higher resources of intellectual warfare. Political
discussion mostly turned upon a certain small number of ideas, revolving
in one unvarying round. The question to be settled always was, Had the
Charter been observed? From which an aspiring disputant occasionally
ascended to the more comprehensive subject of inquiry, Whether the
Charter ought to be observed? viz. whether so much liberty, and security
for good government, as the Charter gave, ought to exist; not whether
more. And then was to be tried over again daily the cause of the first
Revolution. The dispute was, not what should be done now, but, whether
what had been done in 1789, to annihilate the privileges of the Nobility
and the political power of the Church, were well done? and whether the
King and his Ministers were trying to undo it? and whether the means
they used were or were not in accordance with the text of the Charter?
These discussions certainly were not altogether unfruitful; they cannot
be said to have done nothing towards educating the public mind. They
helped to confirm the French in their antipathy to sacerdotal
ascendancy, and to Edition: current; Page: [694] every description of
hereditary rank: sentiments which being thus perpetually called into
action, perpetually gained strength, and have taken the deepest root in
the national character. By frequent discussion of the limits which a
written constitution imposed upon the King’s will, the French became
more and more attached to the forms of legal rule, and to a strict
definition of the powers of the magistrate. But this was all: beyond
these few points, not one great principle of government and social
organization was usually appealed to. No progress was made in
familiarizing the public mind even with the real essentials of a
representative constitution; and the Three Days found the nation so
unfurnished with any distinct conceptions on the subject, that months
elapsed before it occurred to any one to think what an opportunity had
been lost for securing to thirty-three millions of people a larger body
of electors than eighty thousand. So backward was not only the popular
mind, but even those superior intellects, which in France far more than
in England carry the popular mind along with them. If they were so ill
prepared on constitutional subjects, which they had thought of, they
were still more completely at sea on the questions of detail and
application, of which they had not thought. If they had once felt easy
about their Charter, they would soon have bethought themselves that a
Charter after all is not good laws, but merely permission to make them,
and would have instantly set about using the permission. As it was, they
never had a moment’s leisure during the fifteen years to think what use
they should make of their Constitution when they had secured it. They
were like the Roman legionary, who, stationed for twenty years in a
distant province, fought for his country until he forgot that he had a
country, for any purpose except to fight for.

But the Revolution of the Three Days was the date of a new era. It set
free the national mind. Since then, the question has been, not how to
defend what was already gained, but how to gain more. Improvement, and
not Conservation, has been the prize contended for. The questions of a
Hereditary Aristocracy and a Dominant Church are disposed of for ever:
the last appeal has been made, it was to the sword, and it has been
tried and decided. Louis Philippe, and the bourgeois Oligarchy on whom
his power rests, will not repeat the mistake of Napoleon and the elder
Bourbons, by encumbering themselves with those detested appendages. That
a Government may be very detestable without them, was a lesson which the
French people, for want of sufficient experience, had yet to learn, and
in which Louis Philippe has proved himself an apt instructor. We
question whether anything but the experiment they are now making could
have convinced the French that the mischiefs of an Oligarchy do not
depend upon its being this or that particular kind of Oligarchy, but
upon its being an Oligarchy at all. This they were strangely ignorant of
some few years ago. They are now seeing it every day more clearly. The
prevailing political opinions, there as elsewhere, still leave much to
be desired; but the more active and intelligent portion of the French
public are beginning distinctly to perceive, that the first Edition:
current; Page: [695] fundamental principle of good government in a
civilized country, is protection against the sinister interests of the
few by periodical accountability to the many. Nor do the advances which
democratic opinions are now making among the French, arise, as is
pretended, from a blind passion for equality; but from the exhibition
which the now dominant class is constantly making before their eyes, of
its own inherent selfishness and corruption.

And now, too, their lips are unsealed, and they dare avow that let
Charters say what they may, less than good government will not content
them, and good government they are determined to have. The Three Days
have given them back the audacity which Leipzig and Waterloo had
quelled.3 A dynasty the work of their own hands, and a Charter run up in
a few hours to stop the gap made by a Revolution, do not suffice to
overawe them.

An attempt has indeed been made to restrain the expression of political
opinion within definite bounds, by the trite and vulgar expedient of
making all persons in the exercise of a public function, even down to
the electors of a village corporation, take an oath of fidelity to the
constitution.4 When MM. Voyer d’Argenson and Audry de Puyraveau, after
having, as deputies, taken this oath, avowed that they held opinions and
pursued objects completely at variance with the Constitution, there was
much very bad acting of vehement indignation.5 Some of those who joined
in the outcry, had in the course of their lives sworn fidelity to as
many as thirteen Constitutions. But they probably quieted their
consciences with the reflection that they had kept their oath, by never
failing in their allegiance to any government so long as it was the
strongest; which MM. d’Argenson and de Puyraveau have done, and are
consequently perjured.

Oaths of allegiance, empty formalities at all times, are most
mischievous ones in an age of revolution, by confusing the boundaries of
right and wrong, and accustoming men to trifle with the outward symbol
of a solemn obligation. They are never observed, and never ought to be
so: like our Custom-house oaths (recently abolished)6 and the oaths
taken by students at our Universities,7 they may justifiably be
considered as mere forms: their guilt, if guilt there be (though it is
rather folly), is in imposing them, not in taking them and in violating
them. If such oaths were binding, a Nero or a Charles IX might tie up
the consciences of all honest men from resisting their tyranny.8 No
honest man will accept Edition: current; Page: [696] favours, from a
Government which he cannot honestly engage to support: but he will
accept from electors the office of watching and controlling the
Government. The distinction is broad and obvious. Governments may
prescribe conditions to their servants, but not to their masters. If a
Government is at liberty to enact that no one shall either elect or be
elected a member of the Legislature without swearing to the entire
Constitutional Law of the country, as printed in a book; and if no one
who thinks any change in any part of this book advisable, feels himself
at liberty to take the oath; no change can ever be effected by legal
means, and no road is left open for improvement but through a violent
revolution. If at our general election in 1831, every elector had been
compelled to swear fidelity to the rotten boroughs, would it have been
better to let the Reform Bill drop, or to carry it by pikes and muskets
instead of votes, or to submit to the degrading formality of the false
oath, publicly declaring it to be a mere formality?

The declaration of these two Deputies (men of the highest reputation for
honor and integrity, both as men and as politicians), far from being
immoral, is an indication of a great progress in the morality of public
discussion. Men now speak out plainly; they declare with candour and
simplicity their real sentiments, their ultimate purposes; and have
discarded the timid, the reserved, the prudent (shall we say?) or the
artful policy, to which the clever writers of the St. Simonian Globe
gave the name of la comédie de quinze ans.* There are now no more
disguises, no equivocations, no conventional hypocrisies. No one who
does not really feel attachment to the first magistrate of the State,
holds it necessary to speak of him in the language of loyalty and
devotedness. No one who desires the entire abrogation of the existing
Constitution and the establishment of a Republic, feels himself
restrained from avowing his creed, and saying all that he has to say in
defence of it: and it is avowed by Deputies in the Chamber, and
systematically advocated by newspapers of the highest merit Edition:
current; Page: [697] and character. If opinions subversive of the
existing government are thus openly avowed by a powerful and rising
political party, it may well be imagined that the freedom is complete
for minor differences of opinion. With all the inclination in the world
to stifle inquiry, the ruling power is unable to give it even the
slightest check: nothing is protected from questioning: all the great
principles of government and the social union are brought perpetually
into play, either to be contested or to be applied: and the result is a
sifting of opinions, and an increased mastery over the first elements of
political science, to which there has been no parallel heretofore in
France.

The improvement is perhaps most striking in this, that the active
politicians, whether speculative or practical, no longer limit their
interest, even their immediate interest, to forms of government: on the
contrary, the tendency of the rising school of political reformers is,
not indeed to be indifferent to forms of government, but to value them
chiefly as means to some definite end: not for some supposed inherent
excellence in themselves, which has been a very prevalent notion
hitherto in France; not even as the surest means for attaining the
public good, whatever that may happen to be; but as means for realizing
some conception already entertained of good legislation and an
enlightened management of the interests of society in detail. French
politics, in short, are beginning to partake somewhat of the practical
and business-like character of our own. The English indeed require
correction the contrary way: under the notion of being practical, they
are mechanical, literal, and narrow: what cannot be weighed or counted,9
is to them as if it did not exist. They leave out of their calculations
almost entirely the influence of the general spirit of the institutions
of a country, looking exclusively to the effect of the definite and
tangible provisions. The French will never run into that extreme, and we
congratulate them heartily upon the prospect of deliverance from the
other.

Much more than we have said, and more than we have now room for, is
necessary to give any adequate conception of the new spirit which has
been infused into political speculation in France, and the altered
character of the views now prevalent both on the principles and on the
details of legislation and administration. But we must reserve the
further prosecution of this subject, either for a separate article, or
for occasional notices as suitable opportunities present themselves.

245.: FRENCH NEWS [92]
 EXAMINER, 30 MAR., 1834, PP. 200-1

These news items are headed “London, March 30, 1834.” Mill’s
bibliography includes this entry: “The summary of French news in the
Examiner of 30th March 1834” (MacMinn, p. 39). In the Somerville College
set of the Examiner, however, there is no listing of any article in this
number except for No. 244. There is, therefore, some doubt about Mill’s
authorship of the extracts below, which appear where his summaries
usually are, but deal with matters he usually ignores.

the globe observes—

Some pointed notice is taken in the Constitutionnel of the language and
conduct adopted towards the Swiss Cantons for resisting the dictation by
the Russian and German governments of the expulsion of the unhappy
Poles. The Constitutionnel, naturally enough, cannot understand the
grounds upon which such demands can be reasonably made by Russia upon
Switzerland. “In the British parliament,” continues the journalist,
“Lord Palmerston denied that the government had received a circular said
to have been addressed by the Court of St. Petersburg to the different
Cabinets, urging them not to grant an asylum to the Polish refugees and
afford them succour. If we are well informed, however, Count Pozzo di
Borgo has delivered a note to such an effect to the Duke de Broglie, and
is urgent for an answer. We hope and believe that the answer of the
Minister for Foreign Affairs will be prompt and dignified. Our territory
is Free, and France has never been inhospitable. The government
certainly should, by means of the regular police, take care that the
refugees do not disturb public order, but this great nation will never
suffer the unhappy exiles from Poland to be refused succour and
support.”1

A Petersburgh Journal calculates the number of fugitives so ruthlessly
persecuted, and to whom the Autocrat would deny earth, fire, and water,
at 250 or 300 at the utmost, scattered over France, Switzerland and
England—this, we need hardly observe, is understating the numbers, but
according to the showing of the Russian journalist, so heavy is the
vengeance aimed against these few harmless, penniless, resourceless
wanderers! It is for the people of civilized countries to sustain these
victims of a brutal tyranny.2


SATURDAY NIGHT

There is no news of any interest. The French papers mention a rumour
that Edition: current; Page: [699] King Leopold3 has asked the French
Government for the assurance of military aid in the event of Dutch
aggression.

The French Minister of War has stated that a respectable naval force
will be maintained in the Mediterranean till the affairs of the East are
settled, as a measure of prudence, not of apprehension of any
interruption of peace.4

 EXAMINER, 6 APR., 1834, P. 215

This article is headed “London, April 6, 1834.” The entry in Mill’s
bibliography covers this and Nos. 247, 249, and 250: “The summary of
French news in the Examiner of 6th, 13th, 20th, and 27th April 1834”
(MacMinn, p. 39). This report is listed in the Somerville College set of
the Examiner as “Article on France.”

the law prohibiting all associations in France, without the previous
license of the government, has passed the Chamber of Deputies, after a
long debate, without the slightest modification.1 The government refused
to tolerate the existence of societies even for purposes the most remote
from politics, lest under their cover political associations should find
shelter. They refused also to introduce a clause declaring the law to be
temporary.

After thus immolating one of the most valuable liberties of their
country to the terrors and vindictiveness of Louis-Philippe, the Chamber
has left the ministers in a minority on a question where they were
probably in the right. The claims of American subjects upon the French
government, for losses caused by Napoleon’s anti-commercial decrees,2
have remained unsettled to this day. The French government has at last
signed a convention with the United States for the liquidation of those
claims by the payment of a million sterling. The Chamber has refused to
grant the money, and the convention, therefore, cannot take effect.3 In
England the whole Cabinet would in such circumstances have Edition:
current; Page: [700] resigned; but in France, where ministers are but
the clerks of the hereditary and irresponsible minister Louis-Philippe,
who we may rely upon it will never resign, it is rather surprising to us
that even the Foreign Minister, M. de Broglie, should have thought it
incumbent on him to offer a resignation which we take it for granted he
will promptly withdraw. That M. Sébastiani, ministre sans portefeuille,
should give himself les airs of a resignation, was a still more
superfluous piece of self-importance.4


247.: FRENCH NEWS [94]
 EXAMINER, 13 APR., 1834, PP. 232-3

This item is headed “London, April 13, 1834.” For Mill’s bibliographic
entry, see No. 246. In the Somerville College set of the Examiner, the
item is listed as “Article on France,” with one correction: at 702.6,
“restricted” is altered to “restrictive”.

the court of cassation has once more made a stand against the attempts
of Louis-Philippe to pervert the laws for purposes of despotism and
vengeance. The sentence of the Court Royale of Paris, declaring the
National de 1834, identical with the National (and condemning MM. Carrel
and Conseil to fine and imprisonment for violating in the new journal
the interdict against reporting judicial proceedings, so iniquitously
passed upon its predecessor), had been appealed against to the Court of
Cassation, and has now, by one of the Chambers which compose that Court,
been reversed.1 Thus, for the second time since July, 1830, the highest
tribunal in France has interfered to thwart the King in his most
cherished and worst purposes.

The struggle, however, is not yet over; for, by the provisions of the
French code, the cause must now be reheard before another Cour Royale;
and if this should agree with the original decision of the wretched Cour
Royale of Paris, the affair must then be carried before, not one Chamber
only of the Court of Cassation, as before, but the entire Court;2 who,
however, it is to be believed, will abide by the judgment of one section
of their body.

We needed a decision like this to convince us that there is still such a
thing as law in France, where the government is a party concerned.

Edition: current; Page: [701]
The vacancy in the Cabinet, made by the resignation of the Duke de
Broglie, has been filled by the transfer of Admiral de Rigny, the
Minister of Marine, to the Foreign Department; Admiral Roussin, the
Ambassador at Constantinople, being appointed in his absence to succeed
M. de Rigny in the ministry of marine, which, however, he is not
expected to accept.3 Admiral de Rigny, taken from his peculiar province,
is a mere nullity: but this is justly deemed of no consequence, as the
prime minister, Louis-Philippe, while he exercises a general control
over every department, takes that of foreign affairs under his peculiar
care.

The opportunity has been taken of laying on the shelf two other members
of the cabinet, MM. Barthe and d’Argoût, whose characters have been used
up in Louis-Philippe’s service. To make room for M. Barthe, poor old M.
Barbé-Marbois has been jockeyed out of the Presidency of the Cour des
Comptes;4 while Napoleon’s old Finance Minister, Gaudin des Ardennes,
Duc de Gaête,5 has been removed from the office of Governor of the Bank
of France (which, it seems, is in the King’s gift), to make a place for
M. d’Argoût. It would be amusing, if, to facilitate a modification in
the English Ministry, the King could remove Mr. Horsley Palmer,6 and
give his place to Lord Melbourne!

The successor of M. Barthe is M. Persil, probably the most unpopular man
in France; the frenzied assailant of the Press, and the same who, in a
speech delivered in his official character of Procureur-Général, called
for a law to alter the constitution of Jury-trial, by making the Jurors
vote in secret without any consultation among themselves, and rendering
a bare majority sufficient for condemnation.7

M. d’Argoût is succeeded by M. Thiers, who gives up the department of
commerce to M. Tanneguy Duchâtel.8 If the ministers of Louis Philippe
had any voice in the determination of their own measures, this would be
an admirable Edition: current; Page: [702] appointment. M. Duchâtel is
one of the first living political economists, and the author of the
celebrated memorial from the vine-growers of the Gironde, the most
masterly exposition, in a popular form, of the doctrine of free trade,
which has ever been produced. But neither the divided opinions and
wishes of the minister, nor the tide of public opinion which has now set
in so strongly in favour of relaxing the laws restrictive of commerce,
will be able to accomplish anything for a long time to come; and for an
excellent reason—Louis-Philippe is personally interested in most of the
existing monopolies; and his grasping avarice reigns supreme over the
destinies of a great nation.


248.: FLOWER’S SONGS OF THE MONTHS [1]
 EXAMINER, 20 APR., 1834, P. 244

Added to a letter of 22 Feb., 1834, to W.J. Fox, is the following
gestatory postscript, probably directed to Eliza Flower, concerning
Songs of the Months: “The three beautiful children [the ‘Songs’ for
January, February, and March] shall have justice done them on the
appearance of the third—The birth of the eldest was announced [see No.
229], and a good word spoken for the expected family— / February is a
beauty—but March is grand—” (EL, CW, Vol. XII, p. 215). This review of
the first four songs, in the “Musical Review,” is headed “Songs of the
Months, Nos. I, II, III, and IV. By the Author of ‘Musical Illustrations
of the Waverley Novels,’ ‘Songs of the Seasons,’ &c. Published in ‘Fox’s
Monthly Repository,’ for January, February, March, and April, 1834,” and
is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A notice of the ‘Songs of the
Months’ in the Examiner of 20th April 1834” (MacMinn, p. 39). In the
Somerville College set of the Examiner, it is listed as “Review of Miss
Flower’s Songs of the Months,” with three corrections: at 703.3,
“softness of the April song: we” is altered to “softness. Of the April
song, we”; at 703.21, “runs” is altered to “seems”; and at 703.23,
“fuller a more” is altered to “fuller and more”.

these beautiful songs ought to enlist all lovers of music among the
purchasers of Mr. Fox’s excellent periodical. Even the many to whom
melody is but melody, delicious in itself, but speaking of nothing
beyond, will find an ample feast set before them in these airs; while,
to the smaller number, who require that music shall be to poetry what a
sweet voice is to the sweet meanings to which it gives utterance, they
will yield a still higher enjoyment.

Of the few songs which have appeared, we prefer those for February and
March.1 The February song is like the very note of the birds whose loves
it celebrates. The verses for March, finely descriptive of “winds and
clouds,” have called forth from the imagination of the composer a strain
of inspired grandeur; Edition: current; Page: [703] such, as if arranged
on a full band of wind instruments, would blend gloriously with the
hollow resounding of the tempest, dying away in a passage of the
loveliest and richest softness. Of the April song, we quote the
words—their only fault is shortness:

-   

    -   

        Her cheek is pale, her eyes are wet,
    -   

        Her voice in murmurings
    -   

        Grieves lowly to the morn that yet
    -   

        No sunshine brings.
    -   

        Why linger ye, O laughing hours?
    -   

        Uncurl ye buds, unfurl ye flowers!
    -   

        Sad April sings.

-   

    -   

        The paleness fleets, the tears are dry,
    -   

        Her voice with gladness rings;
    -   

        The sunshine over earth and sky
    -   

        Its brightness flings.
    -   

        Come revel through my laughing hours,
    -   

        Ye warbling birds, ye buds and flowers!
    -   

        Glad April sings.2

The composer has produced a most perfect translation of these words into
musical sounds: and by a rare felicity, the same melody which when
joined to the longing and yearning of the first stanza, seems as if
intended by nature for that expression only, becomes by a change from
minor to major and the addition of a fuller and more rapid
accompaniment, the no less apt representative of the gladness and
buoyancy of the second verse. It seems actually to bound with joy.

We are sensible of the ugliness of crossing at one leap from poetry and
music to shillings and pence, but we should leave part of our duty
unperformed if we were not to mention that these songs, any one of which
if printed in the ordinary way and published separately would be sold
for two shillings, or two and sixpence, may be severally purchased,
together with the cotemporary number of one of the very best existing
monthly periodicals, for eighteenpence.

This article comments on the uprisings which took place in Lyons on 9-13
Apr. and in Paris on 13-14 Apr. The concluding paragraphs on Lord Howick
have been included as Mill’s, even though they are separated from the
rest by a printer’s rule, because Mill alludes to the same speech
against combinations in his “Notes on the Newspapers,” Monthly
Repository, n.s. VIII (May 1834), 365 (see CW, Vol. VI, pp. 207-8). The
article Edition: current; Page: [704] is headed “London, April 20,
1834.” For Mill’s bibliographic entry, see No. 246. In the Somerville
College set of the Examiner, the item is listed as “Article on France.”

we are unable as yet to form any conclusive judgment on the nature of
the calamitous events which have just occurred in France. But as far as
we are yet informed, the facts seem to be as follows:—

For some time past the silk-weavers of Lyons had been at variance with
their employers, and a strike had taken place, to which the emissaries
of the republican associations of Paris had endeavoured, but with little
success, to give a political character.1 The strike, like most other
strikes, lasted for a certain period and terminated; and the operatives
returned to work at the old prices. A well-meaning and prudent
government would have rejoiced at this pacific termination of the
struggle, and would have spared itself the odium and danger of violent
measures when the only rational purpose of such measures had already
been attained. But Louis Philippe’s policy is of quite another
complexion. After the strike was over, he chose to prosecute its
principal leaders. This excited a commotion, and the people would not
suffer the trial to proceed. Mutual acts of hostility occurred, and the
affair growing serious, the malcontents of all classes, political or
not, united their strength, and burst out at once into a Republican and
a Trades’ Union insurrection. The insurgents maintained for five days,
with the most desperate valour, a sanguinary contest with the troops,
which ended in their total defeat. Of the loss of lives and property,
and the injury to the town itself, nothing is yet known but that they
are immense.

The events at Paris have been of a very different character. The
Government placed a formidable force under arms, and gave a military
aspect to the whole city. As usual at Paris, and as was perhaps
intended, this did not prevent, but, on the contrary, promoted the
concourse of people. In one of the most crowded parts of the city (the
Place du Châtelet), the police attempted a repetition of those outrages
against the persons of unoffending spectators, of which their conduct on
the Place de la Bourse, a few weeks ago, afforded so disgusting a
specimen.2 The people were in too excited a state to brook this; a
collision took place; and fighting having once begun, the same
consequences followed as in June 1832.3 Edition: current; Page: [705]
That portion of the more hot-headed political malcontents who, without
having premeditated an insurrection, are always ready to join in one,
attempted to form barricades, but were speedily overpowered; and the
penalty of their folly will now be borne by the French people, on whose
necks they have helped to rivet the yoke of an iron despotism.

The Government has expressed its intention to apply to the Chambers for
what even itself calls the strongest measures of repression.4 What these
are it has not yet disclosed, they are probably such as will confiscate,
temporarily at the least, all the remaining liberties of France.
Meanwhile the insurgents, and all whom it chuses to accuse as such, are
to be tried by the Chamber of Peers, that they may be deprived of the
protection of a Jury; and, in direct defiance of law, the Government has
taken the opportunity of suppressing the Tribune newspaper—nailing up
its printing-office, dismissing the compositors, and depriving the
printer, M. Mie (who has also been arrested) of the patent, a license,
without which, by an odious abuse, no one in France can carry on the
business of a printer.5 Of course, no other printer will consent to risk
the same fate by giving to this obnoxious paper (which has been
prosecuted ninety-six times since the July Revolution), the aid of his
types and printing presses.

It is said that no fewer than a thousand arrests have taken place in
Paris alone.

Another week will show what sort of vengeance Louis Philippe means on
this occasion to execute upon his vanquished enemies. There is no doubt
that it will be left entirely to his choice, and there is every reason
to believe that it will be most unsparing.

Upon the subject of the Trades’ Unions, and a warning reference to the
bloodshed in France, Lord Howick made the following fierce remark:

He could not sit down without noticing the allusion of the honourable
and gallant member opposite to the disturbances in France. It was said
that this ought to teach them that it was not by a course of rigour that
they were to put an end to proceedings of this kind. These proceedings
taught him (Lord Howick) a very different lesson. It was a struggle
between two classes, and whatever side obtained a victory, a dreadful
and lamentable slaughter must take place.6

Edition: current; Page: [706]
We were convinced that the issue of the unfortunate struggle in France
would encourage the Whig Ministry to dare extremities. The proposed
procession of the Unions on Monday is most ill-judged, and from any
accident or foul play the most frightful consequences may ensue.

the french government has introduced two measures; one for increasing
the army to 410,000 men, the smallest number with which it professes to
be able to coerce the disaffected;1 the other for the more effectual
punishment of all who are taken in arms against the Government, who
assist in any insurrectionary acts, or who possess arms or ammunition
without the license required by law.2 These propositions are of a less
despotic character than the public were apprehensive of; but the
Committee of the Chamber is expected, and was almost invited by the new
Minister of Justice, to amend the latter measure, by subjecting all
persons accused of rebellion to the jurisdiction of Courts Martial.3 The
état de siège, which so scandalised the public two years ago, is thus to
be made permanent.4

The horror and disgust of all Paris has been excited by the conduct of
some of the soldiers of the 15th regiment of infantry, who, having been
fired upon during the late insurrection by a pistol shot from one of the
upper windows of a house in the Rue Transnonain, entered the house and
massacred all the inhabitants, to the number of between twenty and
thirty persons.5

Edition: current; Page: [707]
the preliminary proceedings of the Chamber of Peers for the trial of the
persons alleged to be implicated in the late insurrections at Lyons,
Saint Etienne, and Paris, have not yet received publicity. In the
meantime, however, the French government have resorted to another of
their accustomed tricks for evading trial by jury. That mode of trial is
limited by the French law to some of the higher class of crimes, and to
political offences.1 A strike for wages, in France is an offence, but
not, it seems, a political offence; therefore, the offence of
instigating to a strike is not a political offence, and may consequently
be tried by the tribunal of correctional police, without a jury. It
happened that the Société des Droits de l’Homme a few months ago
nominated a committee which placed itself in communication with various
trades’ unions, then in the course of formation at Paris, for the
express purpose of convincing them that strikes for wages are of no use,
and that they ought to concentrate their efforts for the purpose of
obtaining redress for their political grievances. This was instigating a
strike; for instigating a strike, the members composing the committee
have been tried without a jury, convicted and sentenced to be imprisoned
for periods of two and three years.2

There has been a debate of several days in the Chamber of Deputies, on
the estimates for Algiers.3 That possession, which was there shown to be
more costly than advantageous to France herself, might yet have been so
managed that its annexation to the French dominions might have been a
benefit to civilization. But it has been utterly mismanaged, and the
people so ill-treated, that we have ceased to wish that France should
have the country, and we scarcely regret the symptoms which the Chamber
has manifested of a desire to relinquish it.


252.: WALTER ON THE POOR LAW AMENDMENT BILL
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 12 MAY, 1834, P. 2

After two years of writing only for the Examiner (which continued to be
his main newspaper voice for the next few months), Mill here returns to
the Morning Chronicle for which (except for the translation given in
App. C) he had not written since 5 June, 1828. He is responding to “The
Poor Laws,” The Times, 8 May (Thursday, not Friday, as Mill says), 1834,
p. 6, which in turn recommends a pamphlet by John Walter (1776-1847). A
Edition: current; Page: [708] Letter to the Electors of Berkshire, on
the New System for the Management of the Poor, Proposed by the
Government (London: Ridgway, 1834). Walter, son of the John Walter who
founded The Times (1739-1812), gave the newspaper its character and
importance. The discussion centred around the controversial new Poor
Law, “A Bill for the Amendment and Better Administration of the Laws
Relating to the Poor in England and Wales,” 4 William IV (18 Apr.,
1834), PP, 1834, III, 235-90 (enacted as 4 & 5 William IV, c. 76, in
1834). This unheaded article is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A
leading article in the Morning Chronicle of 12th May 1834, on Mr.
Walter’s pamphlet against the Poor Law Amendment Bill” (MacMinn, p. 40).
See also No. 253, a leader on the Poor Law in the Sun published on the
same day as this, and No. 265.

the times, of Friday last, contains nearly two columns of extracts from
a Pamphlet against the Poor Law Amendment Bill, which it introduces to
the notice of its readers in the following words:

Among the numerous Pamphlets on the Poor Laws which have reached us, we
have been struck with the following passages in a Letter from a County
Member to his Constituents, which we extract, because we think them
deserving the attention of our readers, particularly at this period.

The nameless County Member, whose Pamphlet our contemporary has been
struck with, and so studiously explains his motives for quoting, is John
Walter, Esq., M.P. for Berkshire, and the principal proprietor of The
Times. There is a considerable difference between the tone of the
pamphlet and that of the newspaper. When Mr. Walter uses his own voice,
he “roars” much more “gently” than when he speaks through his
“thundering” Editor.1 His language is not brought, like that of his
journeymen, from Billingsgate; nor does he show any of that canine
rabies which is characteristic of his newspaper, whether in a bad or in
a good cause, and which has fixed on it indelibly the vulgar epithet
originally stamped upon it by a greater master in blackguardism.2 In
substantial merits, Mr. Walter’s own argumentation, and that of the
stronger and coarser hand whom he employs, are much upon a par; but that
utter disregard of every fact or argument militating with their
conclusion, which is common to the County Member and his penman, has, in
the latter personage, every appearance of being intentional, while in
the former it seems the involuntary result of a real incapacity to feel,
even in ever so slight a degree, the force of any facts and arguments
which can be presented to him. There are considerable indications of
sincerity in Mr. Walter’s performance. From this specimen we should
imagine him to be a fair enough sample, both as to their good intentions
and as to the quality of their intellects, of that sort of English
country gentlemen, who, by Edition: current; Page: [709] their mode of
administering the Poor Laws, have so frightfully demoralized our
peasantry, and who (what we care far less about) will in a few years, if
such counsels as Mr. Walter’s are listened to, have handed over the
whole residue of their own rents to be the patrimony of the paupers, and
made the land indeed (in the phrase imputed to Spence and his followers)
the people’s farm.3

Mr. Walter, we understand, is reputed in his neighbourhood “the poor
man’s Magistrate,” which always means one with whom the pauper is
generally in the right, and the overseer in the wrong; one who is
liberal in granting orders for relief after the parish officers have
refused it. Liberality in a Magistrate is like the liberality of an
absolute King; it consists in giving away very freely other people’s
money, and, in the one case as in the other, almost always to the
undeserving. A “poor man’s Magistrate” is one who is ever ready to
compel a parish, in which perhaps he himself has no property, nor pays a
single farthing to the rates, to maintain all who choose to demand
parish assistance in a style of comfort, ease, and liberty, which makes
them objects of envy to those who earn their own subsistence and refuse
to be supported by other people. Mr. Walter is understood to be such a
person; one of that class of Magistrates who, from compassionate
feelings or love of popularity, or both combined, have laid upon their
consciences the responsibility of having made the bulk of the
agricultural population of England paupers at heart (progressively
verging downwards into the condition of paupers in fact). It is,
therefore, quite natural that Mr. Walter should greatly dislike the Poor
Law Bill, the object of which is to deprive such men of the power of
doing any further mischief, and to repair, as far as may be, the
incalculable evil they have already done.

It is no very easy matter to chase Mr. Walter’s reasoning through the
labyrinth of his pages. The staple of his pamphlet is general
denunciations, expressions of alarm, and predictions of evil, with here
and there some grains of argument scattered by the way-side. Let us pick
them up and examine them.

The chief object of Mr. Walter’s dislike is the proposition of a Central
Board. Of this he says,

It is an inversion of what has been esteemed the natural and regular
order of all good Government, which rises from the management of
families, parishes, towns, counties, to the general Administration of
the State. Here the State starts first in the character of a Central
Board, and diffuses its regulations below. This is what the French call
centralization. Everything springs from Government in France; the people
do nothing for themselves; roads, bridges, canals, are all the work of
the State. I do not know that this is a happy example to copy.

(P. 5.)

This is one of the finest instances we have lately seen of a
common-place, in the original sense of the phrase—an argument which will
serve all turns equally Edition: current; Page: [710] well—a standing
argument which saves all inquiry into the merits of the case—an argument
which you may know beforehand may always be used in all cases of a
particular kind, without taking the trouble to look at them—a blank
objection, to be filled up with any measure you please. In a book of
directions to Members of Parliament how to make out a case, this might
stand as one of the instructions: whenever it is proposed to entrust any
duty to the Government, or to appoint any officer to superintend and
check a multitude of other officers, cry Centralization! Be the measure
good or bad, that is one thing which may always be said against it. Any
person of sense and candour would think it necessary to inquire what
duties may be most advantageously entrusted to local, and what to
general functionaries, and whether the case in question fall within the
one or the other class: a fool saves himself the trouble, by making an
objection which avails against all government whatsoever. The Courts at
Westminster are a case of centralization; all the Cabinet Ministers are
cases of centralization; it is centralization to have a King; it is
centralization to have a House of Lords or of Commons: Mr. Walter’s
objection is exactly as strong, neither more nor less, against every one
of these institutions, as against a Central Board. Why should not “the
people,” as Mr. Walter terms the little knots of jobbers who are called
vestries, make their own laws? Why should they not administer justice
for themselves? Why not make war and peace, vote the supplies, and keep
up their own standing army? “The natural and regular order of all good
government rises from families, parishes, towns, and counties, to the
State.” But these are things, it seems, which are better done by the
State than either by the family or the parish—else why have any
Government at all? Take the trouble, then, to examine whether pauper
management, in the department of superintendence and control, be not one
of these things.

Mr. Walter cannot distinguish between two countries so differently
situated as France and England; between a country which has always been
overgoverned, and one in which Government scarcely interferes in
anything. In France, the King and his Ministers are the real governing
power of the country, and it is they who need to be restrained; here the
real Government of the country practically resides in the local
functionaries, the magistrates, overseers, &c., and if the King and his
Ministers need controul, they (i.e. the local functionaries) need it
infinitely more, because they are infinitely less under the public eye.
France wants local bodies to be a check upon the Government; England
wants a Government to be a check upon the local bodies.

Mr. Walter’s next argument is, that the grounds which Ministers have
alleged for their proposition make directly against them. They say that
their system has been tried in above a hundred parishes, and succeeded.

Now what system is this of which his Lordship thus predicates the
success? A system consisting of district workhouses! I have not heard
that an additional workhouse has been built. [N.B. The parishes had
workhouses already.] A system consisting of District Edition: current;
Page: [711] Commissioners and Metropolitan Commissioners—a system
without Overseers and Magistrates—finally, the system which is now
recommended? No; it was totally impossible. The system, therefore, which
produced this wonderful change in the hundred parishes was, in truth,
and must have been, the old system. Why then, I say, abolish such a
system instead of “improving and well regulating it,” as has been done
in these 100 parishes? Why substitute one in its place perfectly
theoretic? [&c., &c., &c.]

(Pp. 9-10.)4

Now let us just consider what the Ministerial proposition is. There are
in England and Wales about 14,000 parishes. Of these about 100 have been
managed well, the remaining 13,900 ill. What says Lord Althorp? He says,
what 100 parishes out of fourteen thousand have done for themselves,
with the most unqualified success, while the other thirteen thousand
nine hundred, instead of following the good example, looked on and did
nothing; this, we must find some means of inducing the 13,900 to do.5 We
will adopt the system of management which has been so beneficially tried
in the 100 parishes; but in order to introduce that system, we cannot
trust to machinery which has succeeded in only 100 cases, and failed in
13,900. “No, [says Mr. Walter,] the system which has succeeded in 100
cases, cannot need any alteration.” But it has failed in 13,900. What
then? Let the 13,900 parishes, to be sure, imitate the 100. But they
will not. Compel them, it may perhaps be said. Why that is exactly the
object of the Bill, and the sole object.

The creation of a Central Board, with discretionary authority, instead
of being a harsh measure, is the only one by which the task can be
accomplished without harshness. A Board can relax its orders, can grant
time, can make exceptions and concessions to peculiarities of
circumstance. An Act of Parliament can do none of these things. A
superintending functionary can gently untie all those knots which the
Legislature, if it proceeded by an imperative statute, must peremptorily
cut. The very object which the opponents of the measure stickle for—a
relaxation of the proposed rule for confining the relief of the
able-bodied to the workhouse—cannot be granted without defeating the
whole measure, unless there be a Central Board. To such a Board, a
discretionary power of making exceptions to that rule may safely and
beneficially be granted. But if the law is to be administered by
Vestries, and Magistrates without any superintending authority, there
could be no hope of improvement unless out-door relief were entirely
prohibited. If the slightest opening be left for it, the same motives
which have produced the present deplorable abuse of that mode of relief,
will continue to produce the same fatal effects. Every increase of the
latitude given to the Central Board is an alleviation of the real or
apparent harshness of the measure as it respects the pauper.

Edition: current; Page: [712]
Mr. Walter advocates the abolition of the allowance system; he would
have no one relieved without coming entirely upon the parish, nor any
relief granted except in payment of labour; but he would have labour
provided for the paupers without bringing them into the workhouse. Now
if there is one thing that is more obvious than another, both from the
evidence before the Commissioners and from the common sense of the case,
it is that pauper labour anywhere but in the workhouse is merely a
particular kind of idleness. A person who is sure of employment whether
his labour be efficient or only nominal, will make no exertion that he
can possibly avoid. An able-bodied pauper, anywhere but in the
workhouse, is necessarily, and is proved to be in point of fact, far
better off than the independent labourer. If the allowance system were
to be abolished, and no workhouses provided, all, or nearly all, who now
receive partial relief, would come upon the parish altogether. If, on
the contrary, workhouses are provided and properly regulated, no one
will choose to enter them who can obtain an honest living by unaided
industry.

Mr. Walter speaks [p. 37] of the “evidence already published by the Poor
Law Commissioners as to the immorality and depravity which the present
workhouse system daily generates:” the very reason why workhouses are,
by the proposed Bill, placed under the superintendence of the Central
Board, in order that all this immorality may be restrained by adequate
regulations. Mr. Walter says that, under any alteration, if crowds of
able-bodied persons are congregated within the same walls, they must be
demoralized. True, perhaps; but any parish employment must congregate
crowds of able-bodied persons. If they were not congregated, but set to
work apart, the parish, for every labourer it employs, must pay a
superintending officer to look after him. Accordingly, when they are not
“congregated” in workhouses, they are congregated somewhere
else—generally in the roads; and if Mr. Walter, in looking at “the
Evidence published by the Poor Law Commissioners,” had not confined his
attention to what seemed to favour his own views, he would have found
the demoralizing effect of the employment of paupers on the roads to be
quite as remarkable as even that of “immuring” them in the present
abominable workhouses. [P. 37.]6 But, in the one case, the evil arises
from the very nature of the case—from the impossibility of
superintendence, and the unavoidable absence of any kind of
classification. In workhouses, there may be the most perfect
superintendence, and any degree of classification is deemed advisable.

We have now exhausted everything bearing any semblance of argument which
we can find in Mr. Walter’s pages. The rest is such stuff as this:—“The
boast of the English Constitution, that it was one of practice rather
than of theory”—“worked well though it read ill”—“a scheme theoretic
merely”—“speculators knowing little of the habits and usages of
Englishmen”—“such a change never took place in this country since the
time of the conquest”—“change Edition: current; Page: [713] of which no
one can foresee the consequences”—“change in the British Constitution
itself”—“revolution in the manners and habits of the British
people”—“consequences which cannot be looked at without dismay,” &c. &c.
&c. [Pp. 21-3.]

In conclusion, as Mr. Walter’s Editor politely intimates that whoever
ventures to say anything in behalf of this measure, after his fiat has
gone forth against it, can have no motive but the hope of finding
opportunities for profit, “and perhaps for peculation,” by employment
under the Bill; it may be as well to state that the writer of the
present article has neither had any employment, paid or unpaid, in
connection with the Poor Law Enquiry, nor will have any in connection
with the authorities to be created by the Bill.7


253.: THE POOR LAW AMENDMENT BILL
 SUN, 12 MAY, 1834, P. 2

On the same day as Mill’s article on the Poor Law in the Morning
Chronicle (No. 252), this leader appeared in the Sun, its concentration
being on the parliamentary discussion. This is Mill’s first contribution
to the Sun. Headed “London, Monday Evening, May 12, 1834,” it is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “A leading article on the Poor Law
Amendment Bill in the Sun of 12th May 1834.”

the majority of friday night, the most overwhelming by which any great
measure of national improvement has been carried through any of its more
important stages within our remembrance, places the fate of the Poor
Laws’ Amendment Bill beyond all peril.1 And many are the instructive
lessons which a Ministry capable of profiting by experience may derive
from this brilliant instance of successful daring. Ministers have set
themselves an admirable example; let us hope that they will follow it;
let it not be lost upon themselves, as it certainly will not upon
others. The spirit in which this measure was conceived forms a most
striking contrast to that of ordinary politicians. They have been moved
to exertion by the mere magnitude of the evil to be remedied, without
waiting till it was clamorously urged upon their notice from without.
Having resolved to do something, they really gave their minds to the
consideration, not of the floating opinions which they might be able to
collect upon the subject, but Edition: current; Page: [714] of the
subject itself; and asked themselves, not what measure was most likely
to meet with general acceptance, but what remedy was best adapted to the
nature and extent of the disease. Further (and to this, next to the
goodness of their cause, they are most indebted for their success),
while the subject was still under investigation, they took measures for
informing the public mind. The facts and reasonings which were to form
the basis of their own conviction, they laid before the nation at large,
and supplied to all persons who took an interest in the question the
means of acquiring a very competent knowledge of it before they
commenced legislating. Having thus laid the foundation of what
governments hitherto have so seldom known the value of—a rational and
enlightened public judgment—they, with a manly confidence in that
judgment, dared to propose all that they clearly saw to be
indispensable. They came forward with no truckling half-measure, but
threw themselves upon the intelligence of the country, and claimed
support simply on the ground of deserving it, and the result is the most
signal triumph. Let this be an example to them of what enters so little
into the calculations of vulgar statesmen—the vast power, in the present
state of the world, of truth and reason. That power is singularly
underrated, which is the less astonishing as it is so seldom tried. That
knaves should not know how to estimate it can surprise no one. But the
multitude of well-meaning persons who prefer any means of influencing
the people rather than a direct appeal to their reason, and place their
trust anywhere rather than in strong argument strongly stated, is
wonderful and lamentable. If the success of poor law reform could cure
either Whigs, Tories, or Radicals, of this weakness, it would be the
beginning of a new era in the greatness of England, and in the
civilization of the world.

What is now of importance is, that Ministers should stand firm, and
resist any mutilation of the measure in passing through the committee.
There may be room for amendment in some of the minor details; and the
great principles of the measure may be considered as safe. The only
danger is, that under the appearance of a trifling alteration in the
details, the enemies of the Bill may succeed in slipping in something
which may clog the main wheels of the machinery.

The point which it is of most importance to protect is the very one
which has been most assailed—the powers of the Central Board; a more
ridiculous clamour than the outcry against this Board, coming, as it
does, from persons who admit the existing evils to be unbearable, we
never remember to have met with. All attempts to reform the pauper
system by laws, without some person to look after their execution, is
visionary. How did the abuses come in? Not for want of laws; for it is
notorious that all the practices which have brought on the present
intolerable evils, were, from the commencement, and have at all times
been, illegal. Declare them so once more, and what will be the effect?
Perhaps another hundred parishes in the whole country will follow the
example of the hundred, or thereabouts, who have already reformed their
administration. In all the others the same motives which have introduced
the abuses will cause their continuance, and Edition: current; Page:
[715] the progress of ruin will scarcely be retarded, much less stopped.
Whatever laws you enact, if you wish them to be obeyed, you must create
a special authority, with power to examine whether they are obeyed or
not, and to enforce obedience, and this is literally all the power which
the bill confers upon the Central Board. The discretionary authority
which has been so much declaimed against goes to nothing but the power
of tempering in the application, or altogether dispensing with, those
rules, which, if there was no such power, must be peremptorily enforced
in all places, and under all circumstances.

For instance, the fundamental principle of all poor law reform is, that
relief to the able-bodied shall, except in peculiar cases, be given only
in the workhouse. The bill accordingly says, that the Board may compel
parishes to enlarge their workhouses, and if they do not voluntarily
consent, may tax them to the extent of one-tenth of one year’s rates for
that purpose.2 Therefore we have an outcry as if heaven and earth were
coming together; one journal talks of “bashaws,” another of the “star
chamber.”3 Meanwhile, how stands the obvious reason of the case? That if
the bill had not done this, it must itself have ordained that every
parish must provide a workhouse adequate to contain the whole of its
pauper population. The discretion of the Board is positively nothing but
a power to mitigate those pecuniary and other obligations which the law
must otherwise have imposed in their fullest extent upon the whole
kingdom, without any exception, or consideration of local circumstances.

Again, the Board has power, by the provisions of the bill, to determine
whether any and what relief shall be given to able-bodied persons not
resident in the workhouse.4 The necessity of putting an end to out-door
relief, as a general rule, is so clearly demonstrated, both by theory
and experience, that the most violent opponents of the measure go no
further than to say that the rule ought not to be inflexible, and that a
latitude must be given. A latitude, then, is given, but as the parish
authorities are altogether unfit to be trusted with it, the legislature,
supposing it to be at all in earnest in desiring poor-law reform, would,
if there were no Central Board, have no choice but to prohibit out-door
relief altogether. Yet so contemptibly ignorant is the clamour, that the
very persons who accuse the bill, even as it now stands, of harshness,
are the same who inveigh against the power created expressly for the
purpose of moderating its harsher provisions, whenever it is not found
necessary to enforce them strictly.

We trust the Ministry will not give ear to Mr. Hawes’s suggestion of
what he calls a tribunal of appeal.5 Appeals are on questions of fact,
or on questions of law, not on questions of expediency; there cannot be
an appeal against a Edition: current; Page: [716] regulation. If a body
were constituted with power to review and set aside the regulations of
the Central Board, that body could only be another Central Board, and
instead of one “triumvirate” there would be two, one to watch the other.
We have not two treasuries, or two admiralties, one to act, and the
other to look on and stop the first when it does wrong. There is no need
of paying two sets of officers to share the responsibility between them.
Responsibility to Parliament and public opinion is the only check it is
possible to have upon either, and that check can only be weakened, or
rather annihilated, by being divided.


254.: DEATH OF LAFAYETTE
 EXAMINER, 25 MAY, 1834, P. 329

Lafayette died on 20 May, Mill’s birthday. This article is headed
“London, May 25, 1834.” Though included in Mill’s bibliographic entry
quoted in the headnote to No. 251 as a “summary of French news,” it is
listed in Mill’s copy of the Examiner in Somerville College as “Obituary
notice of Lafayette,” a more accurate description.

lafayette is no more. The last survivor of the illustrious founders of
American independence—the last of the great names of the first French
Revolution, has perished from among us: Europe has lost him, who, for
forty years, has stood before the eyes of her people as the most
virtuous of her public men.

Lafayette is, indeed, one of the most cheering examples in history of
the influence exercised over the minds and affairs of mankind, by a life
of consistent nobleness. His talents were respectable, but not eminent;
neither as a man of action nor of speculation did he possess
extraordinary mental endowments. He owed all his ascendancy to his
heroic character. It was by his singleness of purpose, his chivalrous
generosity, his undaunted courage, and his unfailing self-devotion, that
he gained a larger share than has been possessed by any human being
since Washington, of the veneration of mankind.

Those who could find no other flaw in his character have accused him of
vanity: would to Heaven there were more persons in the world whose
vanity was of the same kind! Never, we should imagine, was a man whom
two great nations worshipped almost as a god so little intoxicated by
his elevation. He never hesitated to confess an error; was never ashamed
to retrace a false step; he never failed, when occasion required, to
immolate to his country’s good, not only his ambition, his fortune, his
liberty, and his personal safety, but what was far dearer to him, the
ascendancy of his favourite opinions, and the love of that people whose
honest sympathy had been the delight of his life.

A biography of Lafayette, by one capable of comprehending him, would be
one of the most inspiring memorials of virtue since Plutarch’s Lives,
and would Edition: current; Page: [717] have much of the same potency
with that inestimable work, in forming great and good men.


255.: THE ENGLISH NATIONAL CHARACTER
 MONTHLY REPOSITORY, N.S. VIII (JUNE 1834), 385-95

Though it was published in a monthly review rather than a newspaper,
this open letter, signed “A.” (the signature Mill was normally to use in
the London and Westminster), was intended for Le National (see letter to
John Robertson, 28 July, 1837; EL, CW, Vol. XII, pp. 343-4); the
recipient of the open letter was Armand Carrel, editor of Le National,
with whom Mill had in 1833 agreed to exchange articles (ibid., 25 Nov.,
1833, p. 197). Perhaps because of the difficulties Le National was
having (see Nos. 232, 247, and 266), Mill submitted his article to the
Monthly Repository. Headed “Letter from an Englishman to a Frenchman, on
a Recent Apology in The Journal des Débats, for the Faults of the
English National Character,” it is described in his bibliography as “A
‘Letter from an Englishman to a Frenchman, on a recent apology in the
Journal des Débats, for the faults of the English national character’ in
the Monthly Repository for June 1834”

(MacMinn, p. 40).

at your suggestion I have thrown upon paper, though in a hasty and
imperfect manner, some of the thoughts which occurred to me after
perusing in the Journal des Débats under the signature C—s, a criticism
on Mr. Bulwer’s recent work, England and the English.1

The well-known author of these articles is a person to whose writings on
England some attention is due. He is one of the few Frenchmen who have a
considerable acquaintance with English literature; and he knows, for a
foreigner, much of England. His knowledge, however, is of a kind which
reminds me of a saying of one of my own countrymen. Somebody having, in
his presence, praised a third person very highly for the extensiveness
of his knowledge, “Yes,” he replied, “he knows exactly enough of every
subject to have the wrong opinion.” Precisely of this kind is the
knowledge which M. Chales possesses of England. He knows just enough to
encourage him to entertain the most erroneous opinions. He knows just
enough to believe that whatever he does not know, does not exist. He
knows just enough to be able to read a work, by a writer of Edition:
current; Page: [718] acknowledged merit, abounding with descriptions and
exemplifications of many of the most striking features in the social
state of Great Britain, and to close the book without having received a
single impression; never dreaming that he can have any thing to learn on
the subject of England from an instructed and clever Englishman; setting
down, in the quietest manner, as groundless and worthless, every thing
in the book which goes beyond what he previously knew.

It would be ungracious in an Englishman to be severe on a foreigner for
not being severe upon us. I am glad when a Frenchman praises the
English; I am glad when, in a certain stage of his intellectual
developement, he even overpraises us, as I am also when an Englishman,
in the same stage of his progress, overpraises the French. It is a
natural reaction against the national prejudice and antipathy from which
both countries have but recently emerged. It is also a very natural
middle stage in the expansion of an individual intellect. A vulgar
person sees only the virtues of his own nation, only the faults of other
nations: but when, ourselves beginning to rise above the herd, we first
perceive the faults which are prevalent among our own countrymen, we are
apt to pass into the contrary extreme, and to exaggerate the degree of
positive excellence which is implied by the absence of those particular
faults in other nations. While we continue bigoted, all we see in
foreigners is, that they have not our virtues: when we become
half-enlightened, we sometimes see only that they have not our faults,
forgetting, or not sufficiently recollecting, that they have other
faults which may be equally or more pernicious.

This last one-sidedness Mr. Bulwer may have partly fallen into; and even
if, as I am more inclined to think, he is not justly chargeable with it,
yet the tone of severe animadversion in which he speaks to his own
countrymen of their national vices, might require to be modified if he
were speaking of those same vices to foreigners; just as we should
remonstrate with a brother or a friend in far stronger terms than we
should use in speaking of the faults of that brother or friend to a
stranger, who is not already familiar with their good qualities. A
writer, therefore, who had to introduce Mr. Bulwer’s book to the French
public, would have had much to say in mitigation of the unfavourable
impression which might be produced by such strictures on the English if
taken without qualification. He might have said to the French reader,
“Here is a powerfully drawn picture of the faults of the English
character; but a character is not to be judged solely by its faults. The
characteristic faults, both of an individual and of a people, always
point to their characteristic virtues; and if you display the one
without the other, you may produce either a panegyric or a satire, which
you will, but not a fair judgment. By insisting, in the same manner,
upon the faults of the French character, without placing by their side
those excellences which are often the bright side of the very same
qualities, a picture might be made of France as repulsive as Mr.
Bulwer’s picture of England, though with a different kind of
repulsiveness.”

Edition: current; Page: [719]
Had M. Chales reviewed Mr. Bulwer’s book in this spirit, he would have
merited the thanks of both countries. But the course he has adopted is
the very reverse. Instead of bringing forward the other half of the
truth, he denies that half which Mr. Bulwer has so cleverly delineated.
Instead of teaching France to know us, he teaches us not to know
ourselves. Instead of using our example to improve his own countrymen,
he will not allow us to be improved by theirs. Instead of pointing out
to the French how much good, and good of the highest and rarest kind,
and good which they are far from having yet equalled, coexists in
England with all the evil which Mr. Bulwer describes, he boldly avers
that the evil is not evil.

Such commendation of England is worse than the ancient antipathy. It is
unnecessary for me, writing to you, to heap up common places on the
importance of friendship and sympathy between two such nations; but we
want you to sympathize in our virtues, not in our faults. The wiser and
better of the English will not thank a Frenchman for stepping in with a
denial or a vindication of all that they most disapprove in their own
countrymen, all that they are daily and hourly struggling against, all
that they are striving to make their countrymen ashamed of. The
disposition to hold fast by a favourite vice does not stand in need of
any foreign support. The moral teachers of England, those who are
labouring for the regeneration of England’s national character, might
have hoped for aid and encouragement from the nobler spirits abroad;
they are at least justified in presuming that they know their own
country as well as M. Chales knows it, that they wish every jot as well
to it, and are quite as unlikely to judge it harshly, where harshness is
not deserved.

Mr. Bulwer has employed a large part of his work in contending against
what every Englishman of the slightest elevation of soul has long cried
out against, as emphatically and disgustingly our national vice: the
universal and all-absorbing struggle to be or to appear rich, and the
readiness to make any sacrifice of ease, comfort, or personal dignity,
for the appearance of mixing with, or of being honoured with the notice
of, the wealthy. For his spirited denunciation of this vice he is called
to account by M. Chales in the following terms:

Supposez qu’un Anglais, qui sait que le commerce c’est toute la Grande
Bretagne, et que le commerce sans la garantie de la propriété n’existe
pas, écrive deux volumes pour se moquer de la propriété, pour la
bafouer, comme fille aînée de l’égoïsme et comme mère de tous les abus;
que penseriez-vous de lui?—Qu’il faut l’envoyer à la maison de force
s’il est dans son bon sens, et à Bedlam s’il est en délire.—Envoyez-y
donc M. Bulwer, l’auteur de Paul Clifford, de Pelham, et de Devereux, M.
Bulwer devenu saint-simonien, M. Bulwer qui se moque de la propriété et
qui n’épargne pas le commerce. Imaginez ce que ce serait qu’une
Angleterre sans commerce, une Angleterre spartiate, qui croupirait dans
son ignorance et dans son abrutissement. Le bel esprit M. Bulwer a des
railleries très mordantes contre le patriotisme égoïste de l’homme qui
aime son pays comme sa propriété personnelle. Tout ce que nous aimons,
ne l’aimons-nous pas comme nous appartenant, ou comme devant nous
appartenir? M. Bulwer fait des caricatures vives, grotesques, Edition:
current; Page: [720] coloriées, et s’attaque surtout au gros commerçant
de la Cité, appuyé sur la colonne de chiffres et plein de son
importance. Où serait, sans de tels appuis, la prospérité de la Grande
Bretagne? Où seraient ses immenses fabriques, ses gigantesques usines,
et ses admirables ports? Ces choses ne se font pas avec du dandysme et
du bel esprit. M. Bulwer ressemble trop à ces sophistes Athéniens qui
amusaient le peuple aux dépens de ce qu’il avait de meilleur et de plus
utile, pour lui apprendre les jolies phrases, les images agréables, et
les frivoles combats de la parole.2

We have heard of sophists, both at Athens and in other places, who have
amused the people at the expense of what are usually considered to be
“ce qu’ils avaient de meilleur et de plus utile,” their love of virtue,
their love of freedom, their love of their country, their love of the
pursuits of intellect, their love of God. But this is the first time we
have seen any one reproached with attempting to laugh his countrymen out
of the love of money; the first time a people were ever warned not to
let themselves be cajoled into laying down the desire to grow rich, or,
as Mr. M’Culloch would phrase it, “the desire inherent in all mankind of
bettering their condition,”3 by the allurements of “jolies phrases” and
“images agréables.” Would to God that there were in the world, that
there had ever been in the world since it emerged from chaos, any
people, any the smallest, paltriest tribe in the wildest, most
inhospitable desert, among whom the danger lay on that side! Alas! it is
not against such small weapons as a few declamatory phrases and bons
mots, that the aid of moralists and politicians needs be invoked to
strengthen a passion, against the excesses of which the highest degree
of human culture yet attained is barely able to contribute some small
counterpoise, and to neutralize some of its more detestable, of its more
pitiable influences!

Did M. Chales ever know what it was to live in a country where the whole
of life is but one incessant turmoil and struggle about obtaining the
means of livelihood? where the grand object of the existence of him who
has five hundred pounds a year, is to make them a thousand? of him who
has one thousand, to make them two? of him who has two thousand, to make
them ten? where next to getting more, the ruling passion is to appear to
the world as if you had already got more, by spending or seeming to
spend more than you have? where hardly any branch of education is
valued, hardly any kind of knowledge cultivated, which does not lead in
the directest way to some money-getting end? where whatever of any
higher culture still forms part of the received systems of education, is
strikingly in contrast with the spirit of the age, and is kept alive
only by some remains of respect for old customs and traditional
feelings? where Edition: current; Page: [721] (except a few of the
richest of all, who in every country lead idle and useless lives) scarce
a man can be found who has leisure to think, leisure to read, leisure to
feel? where such a phenomenon is scarcely known, as a man who prefers
his liberty to a little more money, who, like so many thousands in
France, can sit down contented with a small patrimony, affording him the
necessaries and comforts of life, but nothing for ostentation, and
devote himself to literature, politics, science, art, or even to the
mere enjoyment of quiet leisure? where by most it would scarcely be
deemed credible if it were told that such men existed? where one who
professed to act upon such principles would be supposed either to have
some purpose to serve by assuming a false character, or to have
renounced wealth because wealth had renounced him, because he had not
talents or industry to acquire it; or, in fine, to be an odd, eccentric,
unaccountable person, bordering upon a fool or a madman? For, the mass
of what, by a truly English expression, are called “the better classes,”
are quite unconscious of any thing peculiar in their eagerness for
wealth; they suppose that it is natural, and that all other persons feel
as they do; they do not philosophize on it, and make a theory to justify
it; they leave that to their French apologist. And the truth is, it is
not properly the love of money which is actuating them; in nine cases
out of ten it is not properly a passion at all,—it is a mere habit; the
acquisition of money is of such immense value in their eyes, not because
they really care much for it, but because they care for nothing else.
Where they are conscious of a motive, what they are aiming at is
consequence: to keep up their importance in the eyes of others, by
keeping up what almost alone gives importance in England, the appearance
of a large income. But they are often unconscious even of this; they are
following a blind mechanical impulse, which renders money, and the
reputation of having money, the immediate end of their actions, without
their knowing that it is so, far less why it is so, and they are merely
astonished and incredulous when they meet with any one who acts as if
with him the case were otherwise. But if their eyes could be opened to
the real state of their own souls, if their imaginations could be
cultured up to the bare perception of the existence of riches which are
above money, and which money will not purchase, believe me they would be
the last persons to make the kind of defence for themselves which M.
Chales makes for them. If they knew what they lose by caring for nothing
in the world but to “get on” in it, they would laugh at the bare idea of
sacrificing the tranquillity of their lives for the sake of “la
prospérité de la Grande Bretagne.” Yes, it is too true that in England a
man is but one wheel in a machine; and that the human race, judging from
English experience, would seem to have been created in order that there
might be “immenses fabriques,” “gigantesques usines,” and “admirables
ports.” But though this is the result, it is not the intention. A
foreigner lands in London or Liverpool, and seeing such docks, such
warehouses, such manufactories as he never saw before, thinks it vastly
fine to belong to a country which has such things; but the merchant, or
the Edition: current; Page: [722] manufacturer, does he ever think of
taking credit to himself for toiling and scraping in order that his
country may possess docks and manufactories? The man has no such
thought, nor would it afford him any solace if he had: he is only
thinking, poor man, of how to escape from bankruptcy, or how to be able
to move into a finer house, in a more fashionable quarter of the town.

If the writer to whom I am replying has never known such a country as
that which I have endeavoured to place before his imagination, let him
bless heaven that he has not; that he lives in a country where money,
though it adds to a person’s consequence, is not necessary to it; where
a great thinker or a great writer is a more important individual than
the richest landowner or banker; where any one who has a whole coat on
his back, though he live in a single room on a fifth floor, is thought
and thinks himself as fit for any society or any salon in the capital,
and is treated on as perfect a footing of equality when there, as the
richest man in the nation. Let M. Chales well meditate on these
advantages, and if he would learn by contrast how to appreciate them,
let him read Mr. Bulwer’s book; for as yet, it is evident, he has but
looked into it.

Does not he accuse Mr. Bulwer of having written his book expressly to
decry the institution of property? of wishing to put an end to commerce?
of demanding “une Angleterre sans commerce, une Angleterre spartiate,
qui croupirait dans son ignorance et dans son abrutissement?” Now, every
person either in England or France who has read the book, knows that
there is not in it, from beginning to end, so much as one word either
against the institution of property or against commerce. It is only M.
Chales who in his simplicity imagines, that whoever hints that the
trading spirit and the love of money-getting can possibly exist in
excess, must be an enemy to property and to commerce. All the moral
writers who have ever lived, Greek, Roman, German, English, French, were
all, according to this writer’s curious definition, “Saint-Simonians.”

Mr. Bulwer is occasionally superficial, and like all epigrammatic
writers, frequently attains smartness at the expense of accuracy; he
also occasionally temporizes with some classes of the enemies of
improvement; but, with all its faults, his book is the truest ever
written on the social condition of England; and the French may be
assured, that although he misunderstands many of the smaller features of
the English character, he has not in greater things at all overcharged
the unfavourable side. Because he writes with perhaps somewhat too
visible an aiming at effect, M. Chales accuses him of attempting to make
fallacies pass by means of lively writing; unconscious that the very
liveliness of the writing is acting upon himself in quite the contrary
way: he thinks the observations must be shallow because they are
brilliantly expressed. Mr. Bulwer’s English readers have, I make no
doubt, been very generally impressed in the same manner. It would be a
great mistake to suppose that frivolity of manner in this country
prepossesses readers in favour of an author’s opinions; on the contrary,
it excites a prejudice against them. But Mr. Bulwer probably thought it
better to be read, Edition: current; Page: [723] even at a disadvantage,
than not to be read. Such is the choice a writer usually has to make, in
addressing himself to English readers, at least of the higher and middle
classes. If his mode of writing be lively and amusing, they distrust all
he says; if he be not amusing, they do not read him at all.

I could easily prove to you by examples that the necessity of being
amusing is the cause of almost every blunder in Mr. Bulwer’s book, even
in matters of fact. For the sake of being amusing, he could not be
content to discuss, he thought it necessary to paint. But, for a
picture, details are necessary as well as outlines: and the details
which were requisite for correctly filling up the picture, Mr. Bulwer
often did not know. This is particularly conspicuous in all that he
writes about France. Thus, to take one instance among many, Mr. Bulwer
dwells much, and with reason, on the characteristic fact (a fact
connected with many other differences between the two countries) of the
great personal consideration possessed in France by the leading
journalists, while in England men are ashamed rather than proud of a
connection with even the most successful newspaper. Almost all Mr.
Bulwer’s general remarks on this subject are just and pertinent; but he
must needs illustrate his assertions by an imaginary conversation
between a supposed editor of The Times and M. Bertin de Vaux. In this
conversation there are some clever traits of satire, but the part which
is borne in it by the representative of French journalism must, by every
Parisian who reads it, be felt as laughably incongruous and absurd; the
smallest blunder being that M. Bertin de Vaux, peer of France, late
deputy for the department of Seine et Oise, is confounded with M. Bertin
l’aîné, principal editor and responsible manager of the Journal des
Débats.4

This reminds me of a most portentous piece of ignorance of the state of
society in England which M. Chales displays, in conjunction with a
curiously perverse misapplication of a true principle. We are all
familiar with that kind of philosophic pedantry, which, when it has got
hold of a few truths which it conceives to be a test of superiority over
the vulgar, applies them à tort et à travers, and sees proof of
ignorance of them in the bare fact of maintaining an opinion different
from its own on any subject. Thus M. Chales declares Mr. Bulwer to be
entirely mistaken in deeming the position of a man of letters to be a
more desirable one in France than in England; and then favours his
readers with a column and a half of observations on the intrinsic
worthlessness of the character of a mere man of letters, a writer by
profession, a hack, who does not write because he has something to say,
but who must find something to say in order that he may write, and by
writing may obtain food or praise.5 Undoubtedly, this Edition: current;
Page: [724] is a character of no great worth or dignity, and the
observations of M. Chales on the subject are perfectly just, and the
more just the more out of place; for, as M. Chales ought to have well
known, Mr. Bulwer was not complaining of any neglect shown to such
literary hacks, who, on the contrary, are almost the only prosperous
persons among our public writers; but of the almost insuperable
obstacles with which those writers have to struggle who are not mere
“hommes de lettres,” but students, giving forth to the world the fruits
of their studies; and the very inferior estimation in which intellectual
pursuits and intellectual eminence are held, in whatever manner
exemplified.

It is a fact, that of all the men of scientific eminence now living in
Great Britain, whether eminent in moral and political or in mathematical
and physical knowledge, there is scarcely one who, if he wanted a
subsistence, could gain it by his scientific pursuits. The consequence
is, that the finest scientific talents are, in the present state of
society, almost lost to the world. Except the one or two in a hundred
who possess an independent fortune, all the men of high philosophical
intellect in Great Britain depend for food and clothing upon the vulgar
pursuits of some mechanical business, which could be quite adequately
performed by persons with none, or with a far smaller share of their
exalted qualities; and are able to devote to their higher calling only
the few leisure hours left them by the intense competition of the
multitudes who, for a little bread, are willing to labour incessantly
without any leisure at all.

Among “men of letters” it is upon such persons as these that the defects
in the present state of society in Great Britain fall the most heavily.
As for the hack writers, whom M. Chales with so much justice condemns,
they, in a world which, whether it confesses it or not, is really
governed by the press, can always, by skilfully playing upon the meaner
passions of the public or of particular classes, reap a tolerable
pecuniary harvest. Of consideration indeed they have little, and
deserve, if possible, less; and this brings me to the statement of M.
Chales which I characterized as a portentous piece of ignorance. He
says:

M. Bulwer, toujours un peu frivole, a signalé entre la France et
l’Angleterre des différences imaginaires. Le rang qu’il attribue à
l’éditeur d’un journal français, est tout à fait illusoire. En
Angleterre, comme ici, lorsqu’un journal est bon, qu’il représente une
masse d’opinions accréditées, et qu’il en est l’organe non seulement
fidèle mais actif, mais spirituel, mais éloquent, il devient centre, il
conquiert de l’autorité, il influe même sur l’Etat. Le chef et l’âme
d’une telle entreprise s’arme d’un pouvoir qui correspond non seulement
à la force de l’opinion qu’il représente, mais au degré de talent qu’il
déploie et dont il s’entoure.6

Mr. Bulwer, not being a fool, did not call in question any thing so
obvious as that in every country where newspapers exist, a powerfully
written and widely circulated newspaper must have great influence. Some
of our newspapers are, as Edition: current; Page: [725] M. Chales truly
says, powers in the state. But this influence of the press does not show
itself in the shape of respect and consideration for those who wield
that great empire; their power resembles that which, in a despotic
country, is sometimes exercised by a low-born and disreputable
favourite, who is at the same time dreaded and despised. I am not afraid
of being contradicted by any Frenchman when I say, that in France the
profession of a political journalist is one of the most honourable and
most honoured which a man of powerful intellect and popular eloquence
can exercise; it is a road to public dignities; a career by which a man
who is suitably endowed by nature and education, rises to a position
from which he might at his pleasure be a deputy or a minister, if he
were not conscious of being already much more than a deputy, or even
than a minister: and as men, previously unknown, may and continually do
rise to eminence by this profession, so do men already eminent avowedly
engage in it, without any other feeling than that they are raising, not
lowering, their personal importance and rank. Now, I request it of you,
show this which I have just written to any English friend, and hear what
he will say. If I were to publish it to all England, I doubt if there
would be found a hundred persons in the whole country who would not
utterly disbelieve the statement. Englishmen cannot conceive that
journalism can be anything but a rather low and disreputable trade. No
man of any rank or station in society likes it to be known or suspected
that he has anything to do with a newspaper. In France there are editors
of daily journals, any one of whom may be considered as individually the
head, or at lowest the right hand, of a political party: in England no
journalist, however popular, is esteemed anything higher than the
powerful and formidable but rather dangerous and disagreeable sting in
its tail.

Like all despised classes, they, for the most part, merit their fate. A
man of talents condemned to disrespect, generally becomes deserving of
it; and makes his talents profitable to himself in such ways as are left
open to him, not restrained by the fear of forfeiting the consideration
he cannot look to have. In France a journalist of eminent talents, like
a deputy of eminent talents, may at the worst have it presumed that the
seductions to which he yields are those of a lofty ambition: but if an
English journalist is unprincipled, the interest which actuates him is
of the most grovelling sort; mere gain. A journalist in England is
considered as an adventurer: and in most instances the estimation is
just. There are honourable exceptions: men more high-minded,
disinterested, and patriotic, than some editors of English newspapers,
are not to be met with. But they are not sufficiently numerous to redeem
the character of their class. Its reputation they could not redeem if
they were five times as numerous. For in England every one who takes
part in politics, and who is poor, is presumed to be an adventurer: and
in England every one is considered poor who is not rich. In England
there is some faith in that kind of public virtue which consists in not
being corrupted, but none whatever in that kind which makes the public
concerns its own, and devotes Edition: current; Page: [726] its life to
them: consequently, if a man appears to make politics his occupation,
unless he is already extremely rich, it is always taken for granted that
his object is merely to get money.

However great the power exercised in England by the press—and it is a
constantly increasing power—there must be a thorough change in the
circumstances of society in Great Britain, before the profession of a
writer will possess that sort of consideration and respectability which
is now possessed, for instance, by the highly gentlemanly profession of
the bar. The moral revolution, of which one of the many effects would be
to exalt public writers to a station and consequence proportioned to
their real power, might be mightily accelerated by their own efforts;
but our men of letters have in general no consciousness of being below
their proper station; they are too morally abject to be worthy of, or
even aspire to, a higher.

But I must pause. Were I to comment upon every unfounded assertion of M.
Chales at as much length as I have in this one instance, my criticism
would be nearly three times as long as his three articles combined. I
will let him off with a remark or two upon one more topic.

One of Mr. Bulwer’s complaints is that moral philosophy, the philosophy
of man’s spiritual nature, his intellect, his feelings, and his duties,
meets with little cultivation in England.7 To this M. Chales makes
answer: “Tant mieux, mille fois; la morale scientifique, divisée par
chapitres, la morale de parade, m’ennuie; elle est stérile autant que
pompeuse: la morale pratique est la seule bonne,” &c. &c.;8 and wisely
tells us that discussions and subtilties on morals are not morality, and
that Greece, Rome, Italy, &c., were least moral, in the ages in which
morality was most talked about. True; and if M. Chales can establish
that the neglect of moral science in England arises from our being in a
state of primeval simplicity, in which a few great and fixed principles
of morals are universally acknowledged and firmly rooted in our hearts,
and that it is from the unswerving firmness of our habitual regard for
our duty that we consider all discussion of it superfluous, I shall
agree with him that his fine talk is strictly to the point and
altogether conclusive. But it argues no small share of primitive
simplicity in M. Chales, that he should ascribe to us that sort of
virtue which consists in the ignorance of evil. The fact is, M. Chales
is completely out in his philosophy; he has confounded the effect, or
rather symptom, and eventual remedy, of a decline in public morals, with
the cause. The Greeks and Romans did not become immoral by theorizing on
morals, though they did not (perhaps) begin to theorize on morals until
they were becoming immoral. When ethical speculations come into vogue,
it is generally symptomatic of a decay, or at least (in the medical
sense) a critical period in a nation’s morals. And why so? Edition:
current; Page: [727] Because it is a proof that the people are no longer
united by a common faith; that the popular creed has begun to give way
before the progress of knowledge. But there never was, and never will
be, a virtuous people, where there is not unanimity, or an agreement
nearly approaching to it, in their notions of virtue. The most immoral
periods in a nation’s history are always the sceptical periods, when the
old convictions are dying away, and no new ones having yet taken their
place, each person “does what is right in his own eyes;” and as in those
periods alone the doctrines of morals appear to require discussion,
those are the only times when (except among casuists by profession) the
discussion and the study of them comes into vogue. Such is now the case
in Germany and France; but in England we are unfortunately in the
predicament of having the will without the remedy. We have thrown off,
or are rapidly getting rid of, our old convictions, and are not forming
new. We have the diversities of opinion, the noisy conflicts; we do
dispute on morality, but we do not philosophize on it, simply because we
do not philosophize upon any thing—it is not our way; we set no value on
systematic thought. This Mr. Bulwer blames us for, and surely with no
little reason. I wish M. Chales would point out to us how, except by the
inquiries and studies which he condemns, we can ever recover from the
state which he laments; how, except through moral philosophy, we can
ever hope to arrive again at unity in our moral convictions, the
necessary preliminary to any elevation of the standard of our moral
practice. Unless, indeed, we may permit ourselves to hope for a fresh
revelation from heaven, which M. Chales, I presume, will hardly be bold
enough to prophecy.

And now I must bring to a close these desultory observations, which yet
I hope may not fail to answer, in some degree, the purpose for which
they were written.

256.: SARAH AUSTIN’S TRANSLATION OF COUSIN
 EXAMINER, 1 JUNE, 1834, PP. 341-2

Cousin’s original work, Rapport sur l’état de l’instruction publique
dans quelques pays de l’Allemagne, et particulièrement en Prusse
(1832-33), new ed. (Paris: Levrault, 1833), was the result of his
investigations made under a commission from Montalivet. Sarah Austin
(1793-1867), wife of John Austin and teacher and friend to Mill, was an
indefatigable translator who had in 1832 alone published Sismondi’s A
History of the Italian Republics and Pückler-Muskau’s Tour in England,
Ireland and France (2 vols.) and Tour in Germany, Holland and England (2
vols.). Mill’s review of her present translation, in the “Literary
Examiner,” is headed “Report on the State of Public Instruction in
Prussia; addressed to the Count de Montalivet, Peer of France, Minister
of Public Instruction and Ecclesiastical Affairs. By M. Victor Cousin,
Peer of France, Councillor of State, Professor of Philosophy, Member of
the Institute, and of the Royal Council of Public Instruction.
Translated by Sarah Austin. [London:] Effingham Wilson, Edition:
current; Page: [728] Royal Exchange. [1834.]” In Mill’s copy of the
Examiner in Somerville College, the item is listed as “Review of Mrs.
Austin’s Translation of Cousin’s Report,” with one correction: at 728.20
“cultivation” is corrected to “combination”. The review is not listed in
Mill’s bibliography, which, however, lists another review of the same
work in the Monthly Repository, n.s. VIII (July 1834), 501-13 (CW, Vol.
XXI, pp. 61-74). In that review Mill quotes a passage also quoted here;
see 729a-a.

this little volume, and an article in Blackwood’s Magazine for July
1833, on the Prussian Government,1 are signal memorials of that standing
miracle, as we might well call it if we judged from English or French
experience—a Government of which the pervading principle is the public
good. The article in Blackwood shows how, in about twenty years, in the
quiet course of peaceful legislation, two great ministers, Stein and
Hardenberg, have scoured the country of abuses; and effected not only a
complete clearing-out of feudal privileges and obsolete restrictions,
but by the degree in which the people are associated in their own
government, laid as fair a foundation for the habits and feelings of a
free people, as France has purchased by all her terrible convulsions.2
In M. Cousin’s Report, again, we behold the animating spectacle of a
government making the civilization, and moral and intellectual culture
of every human being among its subjects, one of the direct objects of
its own existence; and exhibiting in the pursuit of that object, a
combination, probably never seen in any other human government, of
wisdom in the choice of means, of patient energy in the employment of
them, and of that spirit which the politicians of all other countries
despise, that which

-   

    . . . Tempers with the sternness of the brain
-   

    Thoughts motherly and meek as womanhood.3

The moral to be deduced from the admirable spirit and working of the
Prussian Edition: current; Page: [729] Government is manifold; and to
evolve it in all its entireness from the facts, as well as to press
again and again upon the notice of England such of these as are best
calculated to fill her rulers and people with shame at being so far
outdone by the government of an absolute king, is an occupation which
ought to be neglected by no writer of any pretensions to comprehensive
views, or an enlightened public spirit, and shall not by us. We can in
no manner so much forward this object as by recommending to attentive
perusal this translation of M. Cousin’s Report, by a lady with whose
ability as a translator the public are already familiar. All who (we may
say it deliberately) having the means of access to this work, do not
read it, either in the original or in the translation, are indifferent
to the highest interests of their country and of universal improvement.

The remainder of what we have to say, cannot be better said than in the
words of the accomplished translator, whose preface has afforded us more
pleasure than any composition of equal length which has appeared for
years.

aConstituted as the Government of this country is, and accustomed as it
is to receive its impulses from without (a state of things approved and
consecrated by the national ways of thinking), it would be contrary to
reason and to experience to expect it to originate any great changes.
This is not recognised, either by governors or governed, as any part of
its duty. It is to the public mind, therefore, that those who desire any
change must address themselves.a

It is not worth while at the present day to discuss, whether or not
national education be a good. It is possible to imagine a state of
society in which the labouring man, submissive and contented under some
paternal rule, might dispense with any further light than such as
nature, uncorrupted by varied wants and restless competition, might
afford him. But if that golden age ever existed, it is manifestly gone,
in this country at least, for ever. Here, the press is hotter, the
strife keener, the invention more alive, the curiosity more awake, the
wants and wishes more stimulated by an atmosphere of luxury, than
perhaps in any country since the world began. The men who, in their
several classes, were content to tread step for step in the paths
wherein their fathers trod, are gone. Society is no longer a calm
current, but a tossing sea. Reverence for tradition, for authority, is
gone. In such a state of things, who can deny the absolute necessity for
national education?

Supposing, however, all agreed as to this first point; how many weighty
and difficult questions still remain! How many obstacles present
themselves to the adoption of that which here stands before us, not in
theory and conjecture, but in tried and successful practice! It may be
useful to consider a few of these objections.

And, first—As to compulsory education, the idea to which I have alluded
above—that the prime excellence of a government is, to let alone—is so
deeply and universally prevalent here, that there is little chance of a
measure, however beneficent, being popular, which is, unquestionably, an
infringement of liberty. Leaving, however, the question, whether
exemption from restraint is, of itself, the great desideratum for men,*
we may Edition: current; Page: [730] safely affirm, that for the class
most deeply interested in the present inquiry, children, no such
exemption is, or can be, contemplated or advised. The real point at
issue is, whether the constraint shall be a salutary or a pernicious
constraint, a constraint by which their whole future lives are
sacrificed to the present interests of the persons who have the disposal
of them; or a constraint, the object and tendency of which is to secure
to them for life the blessings of physical, moral, and intellectual
health. “If children,” says the writer of the excellent article in the
Foreign Quarterly Review (No. xxiv) “provided their own education, and
could be sensible of its importance to their happiness, it would be a
want, and might be left to the natural demand and supply; but as it is
provided by the parents, and paid for by those who do not profit by its
results, it is a duty and is therefore liable to be neglected.”4

The interference which Government has lately exercised on behalf of the
children of the manufacturing population has, however, settled the
question as one of principle. It is no longer anything but a question of
degree; for, if the right of parents over their children can be invaded
for the purpose of securing to children an exemption from one class of
evils, it can in averting another; and, according to all sound
reasoning, it might, if those evils be shown to be of sufficient
magnitude to claim interference. It is irrational to expect, that
persons who have not had the advantages of education, can form any
estimate of the nature and extent of those advantages. Are, then, the
rudeness and apathy of the fathers a reason for transmitting them
unaltered to the children? Or, to go higher, are the false notions, the
useless acquirements, the imperfect instruction, of the ill-educated of
the wealthier sort a reason that, because they are satisfied with
themselves, an enlightened Government should permit the same waste and
destruction of moral and intellectual faculties to go on from generation
to generation?

[Pp. viii-xi.]

We subscribe perfectly to the justice of this finely thought and
expressed defence of the compulsory principle in education; but we
require, as a preliminary condition to the adoption of that principle
here, what already exists in Prussia, a Government which deserves, and
has, the perfect confidence of the people in its good intentions.

Another misconception, which appears to me common in this country, is,
that the system of national education delineated by M. Cousin, is some
new plan or mode of teaching. I have even seen objections made to it in
print, on the score of the tyranny of compelling parents to educate
children on this or that “method” approved by government.5 It might seem
sufficient to refer such objectors to the book, but unfortunately this
process is tedious, and in the meanwhile the reader, who supposes they
are acquainted with what they discuss, is misled. Not only (as will be
seen in this report) is every parent at full liberty to educate his
children either in his own house, or at a private school, or at the
schools provided by the state; but these latter schools are not even
bound to any particular books, or modes of tuition, “in order,” as the
law expresses it, “to impose no shackles on the constant onward course
of improvement.” The choice of books is left to the masters and the
local committees appointed by government for the immediate
superintendence of schools, and consisting chiefly of fathers of
families resident in the parish which supports the school. The
conferences of schoolmasters, which, though Edition: current; Page:
[731] voluntary, are encouraged by the government, are also for the
express purpose of comparing their views and their experience, and thus
carrying forward the improvement of the schools. Whenever a choice of
schools is within the reach of parents, that choice is left perfectly
free; and on the grand subject of religious differences, it will be seen
that nothing can exceed the anxious care of the government that the most
delicate conscience should not be even alarmed, much less oppressed.
“Masters and inspectors,” says the law, “must most carefully avoid every
kind of constraint or annoyance to the children on account of their
particular creed,” &c.

[Pp. xiv-xv.]

The sentiments expressed in the following passage reach far beyond the
subject immediately before us. We joyfully assist in giving them
currency:

It has been asserted by some persons, with an ignorance which, if it be
sincere, is so shameless, that it almost deserves to be confounded with
dishonesty, that the tendency of the system recommended by M. Cousin is
anti-religious.6 To this every page of the book is an answer. Indeed,
were I to express a fear on this head, it is, that it is far too
religious for this country; that the lofty, unworldly tone of feeling,
the spirit of veneration, the blending of the love of God, and of the
good and the beautiful with all the practical business and the
amusements of life, is what will hardly be understood here, where
religion is so much more disjoined, both from the toils and from the
gaieties of life. To me it appears that there is not a line of these
enactments which is not profoundly religious. Nothing, it is true, is
enjoined as to forms or creeds; but, as M. Cousin truly says, “the whole
fabric rests on the sacred basis of Christian love.”7 As the most
affecting, and I must say, sublime example of this spirit, I refer my
readers—especially the humbler and, as I hope, more numerous class of
them—to the description of the little schools for training poor
schoolmasters in such habits and with such feelings as shall fit them to
be the useful and contented teachers of the humblest cottagers of the
most miserable villages.8

Here is poverty, to which that of many among our working classes is
affluence; and it is hopeless, for no idea is held out of advancement or
change. Yet, if ever poverty appeared on earth, serene, contented,
lofty, beneficent, graceful—it is here. Here we see men in the very
spring-time of life, so far from being made—as we are told men must be
made—restless and envious and discontented by instruction, taking
indigence and obscurity to their hearts for life; raised above their
poor neighbours in education, only that they may become the servants of
all, and may train the lowliest children in a sense of the dignity of
man, and the beauty of creation, in the love of God and of virtue.

I confess myself almost hopeless of the transplantation of such
sentiments hither. Religion is made the theme of the fiercest and most
implacable contention; mixed up with newspaper squabbles and with legal
discussions; her bright and holy garments are seized and soiled by every
angry and ambitious hand.

[Pp. xv-xvi.]

We conclude our extracts with the following recommendation of normal
schools, an institution which our ministry is all but pledged to
naturalize here, and must not be suffered to rest until the pledge is
redeemed:

Time and experience have, it is to be supposed, nearly removed the
illusion of “mutual Edition: current; Page: [732] instruction” as a
substitute for the instruction communicated by a mature to an immature
mind:—as an auxiliary in certain mechanical details, no one disputes its
utility. Observation long ago convinced me of the entire truth of the
maxim laid down by the Prussian government, and approved by M. Cousin,
that “As is the master, so is the school!”9—A system of education is
nothing without an unfailing supply of competent masters. It is the
fashion to apply the “free trade” maxims to everything. Reasons enough
present themselves why such maxims are wholly inapplicable to this
matter. It may, once for all, safely be denied, that the public can be
judges of the quality of teachers, as they are of bread or of shoes. To
this the hundreds of children in the middle classes, whose whole
childhood is consumed in experimental wanderings from school to school,
and the thousands and ten thousands of the lower, whose parents know
little more than the fact that they pass a certain number of hours daily
in a given room, can bear witness. The evil is an irreparable one. Not
only is the portion of time consumed in a bad or imperfect school
irrevocably gone; bad habits of all kinds are acquired, which no future
education can entirely eradicate. The candid and rational among the less
educated classes are glad to be aided by the friendly judgment of their
more instructed neighbours on this point; and would, I doubt not,
readily admit the advantage of having some better security than their
own opinion, or rather conjecture, for the competency of the instructors
of their children.

In every country where primary instruction has been carried to any

the french legislature has been first prorogued, and then dissolved;1
though it has only sat for three years it has voted five annual

Thus has a Session closed which has been productive of nothing but
taxes, and laws for the suppression of insurrections.

we have observed with great regret the announcement of the accidental
death, by the oversetting of a boat at Rouen, of M. Conseil, one of the
editors of the National de 1834.1 France knows not the extent of the
loss she has sustained by the premature death, at an early age, of one
of her most valuable citizens. M. Conseil was one of the most instructed
and clear-headed men in France, one who combined the attainments and
high qualities of an Englishman and a Frenchman; and no man was more
earnestly devoted to the good of his country and the cause of human
improvement.

The same unfortunate accident had nearly been fatal to the only other
man in France, perhaps, whose loss would have been a still greater
calamity—M. Armand Carrel.

A profligate jury has, in contradiction to the strongest evidence,
condemned Messrs. Gervais and Guillemot for publishing the details of
some of the horrible outrages perpetrated upon defenceless prisoners by
the Citizen-King’s Police; but the publicity of the proceedings has
answered the purpose of a complete exposure.2


259.: THE NEW COLONY [1]

Colony’ in the Examiner of 29th June 1834.” In Mill’s copy of the

we have had great pleasure in learning that the enlightened views of
Colonization, so long pressed upon the notice of the public by the
author of England and America,1 by Mr. Gouger, and others, are about to
be realized in the formation of a Colony at the mouth of the
newly-discovered river in Southern Australia. The founders of the Colony
are men of high public character, including a large proportion of the
people’s best friends in the House of Commons. The names of Whitmore,
Grote, Clay,2 and others, are a guarantee to the public of the honesty
and patriotism of the undertaking, and many other names connected with
it are a strong assurance of its probable success as an investment of
capital.

The full concurrence and cordial aid of Government is extended to the
enterprise, which will, however, be conducted at the sole charge of the
projectors, without any expense to the State. Mr. Spring Rice has, we
are informed, evinced throughout the affair a degree of intelligence,
public spirit, and superiority to the influences of official routine,
most honourably distinguishing him from those of his predecessors to
whom the project had been previously submitted.3

A public meeting will be held to-morrow (Monday) at Exeter Hall, Mr.
Whitmore in the chair, to explain the principles on which the Colony
will be founded;4 and all should attend the meeting who would wish to
hear a most instructive analysis of the causes of the success or failure
of former colonizations, and the grounds on which the present may be
expected not only to advance to prosperity with unexampled rapidity,
but, for the first time in the history of colonization, to afford a
sensible relief to the overcrowded labourers and capitalists of the
mother country.

We shall discuss the subject at some length in our next paper.

the french elections have nearly concluded: when the returns are
complete, we will furnish an analysis of them.1 The result, as was
anticipated, is a great increase of the strength of the ministerial
party; the general anticipation, even of those who care for nothing but
tranquility, seems to be that this success by increasing the
foolhardiness of the present Government, will in reality diminish its
security. The Funds instead of rising, actually fell.


261.: THE NEW COLONY [2]
 EXAMINER, 6 JULY, 1834, P. 419

This account is an answer to a leading article on the South Australia
Association in The Times, 2 July, pp. 4-5, in response to the public
meeting of 30 June organized by proponents of the emigration scheme (see
No. 259). A leading article in the “Political Examiner,” headed as
title, it is described in Mill’s bibliography as “An article headed ‘The
New Colony’ and signed A.B., in the Examiner of 6th July 1834” (MacMinn,
p. 41). In Mill’s copy of the Examiner in Somerville College, it is
listed as title, with one correction: at 735.30 “had previously in view”
is altered to “had in view”.

the times has declared war against the New Colony. Everything in the
shape of an argument which is urged by the Times against this project,
proves only that the writer has not read what has been written about it,
nor understands the grounds on which it is supported. From the credulity
with which he swallows a suggestion of a correspondent, that the
Australian scheme is connected with the Poor Law Bill,1 we infer that he
believes this plan of Colonization to be now for the first time brought
forward. It has, on the contrary, been pressed upon the notice of the
public with great perseverance for several years. It was under the
consideration of Sir George Murray, when Secretary for the Colonies; his
successor, Lord Goderich, for some time had in view the adoption of it;
Mr. Stanley also was in communication with the South Australian
Association, and was understood to be Edition: current; Page: [736]
favourable to the project.2 The merits of the plan are indeed so clear
and so striking to any one who will examine it, that it has triumphed
over the strongest prepossessions. Except Mr. Wilmot Horton,3 almost
every one who, beginning with an unfavourable opinion, nevertheless gave
his mind to the subject, has ended by changing that opinion to a
favourable one; of this fact, two of the speakers of the meeting last
Monday, Col. Torrens and Mr. Poulett Scrope, are examples;4 and we
believe that the same thing would happen to the writer in the Times, if
he deemed the subject worthy, as it surely is, of attentive
consideration.

The grand recommendation of this scheme of Colonization is, that it is a
plan of making emigration pay its own expenses. Every one admits, and
every one must admit, that if a portion of our labourers could be
removed from the country, where they are now earning a scanty and
precarious subsistence, and placed in a new and fertile country, under
the best arrangements which could be desired for giving the greatest
possible productiveness to their labour, the surplus of what they would
there produce, above what they can produce in their present situation,
would form a fund sufficient, in a year or two at farthest, to repay
with interest the whole expense of their emigration. Now, this fund, by
the present scheme, is to be taken hold of by the State, by a very
simple mode of taxation, the sale of public lands. And thus the expenses
of emigration will be paid for out of the increase to the general wealth
of the world, produced by emigration itself; the increased produce of
the emigrant’s own labour will be made available to pay the expenses of
his emigration.

But for this purpose an advance of money is necessary; the emigrant’s
passage cannot be paid for out of the funds which are to be afterwards
produced by his labour. It can only be paid for out of monies raised by
loan on the security of that future fund. And yet the Times cries out
against the power given to the King’s Commissioners to raise money by
loan, for carrying out the first emigrants.5 According to the Times,
this proves that fraud is intended, and that the funds to be raised in
the Colony will not be sufficient for emigration. The Times forgets that
before any funds can be raised in the Colony, the Colony must exist, and
that until the first emigrants go out, there is no Colony.

The working of the scheme will be as follows. A sum of money, say
100,000l., is raised on the security of the sale of lands. With this sum
a great supply of labour is taken out; this certain supply of labour
induces capitalists to Edition: current; Page: [737] emigrate (many have
already expressed that intention); these capitalists will purchase
lands, and the proceeds of the sale, after paying the interest of the
loan, will be employed in carrying out more labour. This, again, leads
to further purchases of land, and the price is applied to further
emigration; and so the stream of emigration is perennially kept up,
without any advance of money beyond the original one. The accumulation
of capital in the Colony would take place with a rapidity unexampled in
other Colonies, because in all other Colonies the settlers, being
dispersed at great distances from each other, afford no market for each
other’s produce; and the regular application of the proceeds of the sale
of lands to the emigration of additional labourers will enable the
increase of labour to keep pace with the accumulation of capital,
however rapidly this may take place.

We shall not, at present, enter into the particular grounds on which the
artificial concentration, proposed to be given to the settlers, by
affixing a price upon all grants of land, is shewn to be eminently
conducive to the prosperity of the Colony, and to the rapid growth of
the fund for relieving this country of its surplus labourers. It is
sufficient, for the present, that, for the first time in the history of
overpopulation, emigration will now be made to pay its own expenses; and
whatever relief it can allow to the pressure of population against
subsistence in our own country, will be clear gain—pure, unalloyed good.

We shall return to this subject frequently; and we do not fear to
encounter any scruples, and grapple with any objections, which we have
ever heard, or ever expect to hear, urged against the principles on
which the South Australian Colony is founded.

262.: FRENCH NEWS [101]
 EXAMINER, 6 JULY, 1834, P. 425

This item is headed “London, July 6, 1834.” For Mill’s bibliographic
entry, see No. 257. In Mill’s copy of the Examiner in Somerville
College, it is listed as “Article on France.”

the result of the french elections is that the strength of the Carlists
in the Chamber has increased from three or four to nearly twenty, that
of the liberal opposition has diminished from about 140 to about 100,
and twenty or thirty votes have been gained by the government party.
Every avowed Republican has been eliminated from the Chamber; though at
Niort, M. Armand Carrel, who was put up without his own consent or
knowledge, lost the election only by one vote.

The success of the Government in these elections can surprise no one.
The electoral body is an oligarchy of fewer than 200,000 persons; and,
as has been Edition: current; Page: [738] forcibly remarked, there are
in France twice as many soldiers as electors, and for every elector
about four paid places in the gift of the Government. That so narrow a
governing body should support, with the utmost warmth, a government
carried on for its own benefit, and the whole fruits of which are placed
at its disposal, is no way surprising. But all other electoral bodies in
France are animated by a very different spirit. In the very places where
the Government candidates were returned to the Chamber by the most
decisive majorities, the elections of municipal councils, and of the
officers of the National Guard, have gone very generally in favour of
avowed republicans. The 200,000 electors stand, therefore, in direct
opposition to the real voice of the country; and, by natural
consequence, the “extension of the suffrage” is now the universal
watchword of all French reformers.


263.: WAKEFIELD’S THE NEW BRITISH PROVINCE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA
 EXAMINER, 20 JULY, 1834, PP. 453-4

Mill’s support for the colonization plans (see Nos. 259 and 261) here
takes the form of a review of Wakefield’s anonymous work, the authorship
of which was widely known. His review, in the “Literary Examiner,” is
headed “The New British Province of South Australia; or a Description of
the Country, illustrated by Charts and Views: with an Account of the
Principles, Objects, Plan, and Prospects of the Colony. [London:] C.
Knight. [1834.]” It is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A review of
E.G. Wakefield’s book on South Australia; in the Examiner of 20th July
1834” (MacMinn, p. 41). In Mill’s copy of the Examiner in Somerville
College, it is listed as “Review of ‘The New British Province of South
Australia.’ ”

this little work consists of three parts: first, a description of the
natural features of the country in which the new colony is to be
established; secondly, an explanation of the intended mode of
colonization; and lastly, a statement of the inducements to people of
all classes who find themselves ill at ease in the mother country, to
establish themselves in the new settlement.

With respect to the soil and climate of Southern Australia, we should
have left the author to speak for himself, if the Chronicle of Wednesday
last had not, while concurring warmly in the views of colonization
entertained by the founders of the colony, expressed doubts of the
eligibility of the place which they have selected for the first
experiment.1 The Chronicle does not, indeed, give any satisfactory
reasons for its doubts. Its tone reminds us of a remark of Archbishop
Whately, that nothing is more common than for a statement supported by
the strongest evidence to be met, not by a refutation, but by a “We
suspect this Edition: current; Page: [739] statement to be exaggerated,”
after which the assertion, thus branded by a note of suspicion, is
thrown aside, as if its falsehood had been proved.2 “On this subject,”
says the Chronicle, “we have our doubts. The fertile land is, we
suspect, confined to the immediate banks of the river down which Captain
Sturt proceeded.”3 Why does he suspect? What right has any man to
proclaim to the public that he suspects what men of character affirm,
without assigning a single reason for his suspicion? We cannot call this
a reason: “The absence of high mountains will not allow us to indulge in
the idea that there is sufficient humidity to allow of the cultivation
of the soil at any distance from the river.” Fudge. What “high
mountains” are there in the South of England? or the North of France? or
Belgium? or Prussia? or Poland and European Russia? the finest corn
country in the Old World, though you might travel from the Baltic to the
Black Sea without crossing a hill 500 feet in height. As for humidity,
“In New South Wales,” says the author of the work before us, “as in
similar latitudes of the northern hemisphere, more rain falls during the
year than in England.” [P. 14.] If it did not, Australia would be an
exception to all the known geographical laws of the distribution of
moisture over the surface of our globe.

We have no room for extracting from the work before us any further
remarks on the natural advantages of the country about to be colonized.
We hasten to the intended method of colonization.

Like the Grecian colonies, which flourished so rapidly and so
wonderfully as soon to eclipse the mother cities, this settlement will
be formed by transplanting an intire society, and not a mere fragment of
one. English colonies have almost always remained in a half-savage state
for many years from their establishment. This colony will be a civilized
country from the very commencement.

Sir Joseph Banks4 [says the tract before us] wishing to ornament a bare
piece of ground in front of his house near Hounslow, transplanted into
it some full-grown trees. Those trees were torn from the beds in which
they had grown to maturity. In order to save trouble in moving them, all
their smaller roots and branches were cut off: the trunks, thus
mutilated, were stuck into the ground; and there, wanting the
nourishment which they had before received through innumerable leaves
and fibres, they soon died and rotted. A way, however, has lately been
discovered of transplanting full-grown trees so that they shall flourish
as if they had not been removed. The art, for a knowledge of which we
are indebted to Sir Henry Steuart, consists in removing the whole of the
tree uninjured;5 the Edition: current; Page: [740] stem, all the limbs,
every branch and twig, every root and fibre; and in placing the several
parts of this whole in the same relative situation as they occupied
before; so that each part shall continue to perform its proper office,
the trunk to be nourished by its proper number of mouths above and
below; and a due proportion or balance be preserved between the weight
of the branches and the strength of the roots, between the action of the
roots as well as branches on opposite sides, between the functions of
each part and the functions of all the other parts, respectively and
together. The work of colonizing a desert bears a curious resemblance to
that of transplanting full-grown trees. In neither case is it the
ultimate object merely to remove; in both cases it is to establish; and
as, in the former case, the immediate object is to remove, not a mere
trunk, but an entire tree, so, in the latter case, the immediate object
is to remove, not people merely, but society. In both cases equally,
success depends upon attention to details. The planters of modern
colonies have generally gone to work without much attention to details;
as if society might be established in a desert without regard to the
numerous and minute circumstances on which society depends. Many a
modern colony has perished through the inattention of its founders to
little matters which, it was supposed, would take care of themselves. Of
those modern colonies which have not perished, many suffered in the
beginning the greatest privations and hardships; while, in the least
unfavourable cases, it has been as if a full-grown oak, carelessly
removed and soon dead, had dropped acorns to become in time full-grown
trees. But in the present case, the greatest attention will be paid to
details. The present measure of colonization may be likened to the
careful removal of full-grown trees from a spot in which they were
injured by want of room, to one where they should have ample space to
expand and flourish. The details of the measure form the subject of this
explanation.

[Pp. 4-6.]

The requisites are—

First, precautions for the removal, not of people merely, but of
society; that is, of all the different classes of people who, by means
of combining their powers and dividing their employments, obtain every
advantage that a society enjoys over a savage life: secondly,
precautions for preventing that social colony from degenerating into an
unsocial state; for preserving, that is, in the colony, the attributes
of society and civilization.

[Pp. 6-7.]

The means selected for these ends evince a just and profound
appreciation of the circumstances on which the industrial prosperity of
a country (if we may be forgiven the convenient Gallicism) depends.

The three elements of production are land, labour, and capital: and on
the proportion of these three to one another depends the prosperity of
the people. If any of these elements are in deficiency relatively to the
others, suffering or inconvenience is the result. In England land is the
deficient element; labour and capital, relatively to land, are both in
excess; there is a forced cultivation of bad land, forced
over-cultivation of the better soils, and, in a manner understood by
economists, and felt, though not scientifically analysed by practical
men, low wages and low profits are the consequence. In the backwoods of
America, and still more in South Africa, the Pampas, and other
imperfectly settled countries, land is in excess, labour and capital in
deficiency. Each settler possesses himself at once of a piece of land;
the few labourers who originally have not the means of Edition: current;
Page: [741] acquiring land, convert the first savings of their high
wages to that purpose, and will thenceforth work for none but
themselves. There is no co-operation, no combination of labour; no
family can raise any kind of produce which requires much more labour
than that of its own members, and (to say nothing of the discomfort and
moral disadvantages attending a dispersed society) scarcely anything but
food and the coarsest clothing can be produced. All have an abundance of
the mere necessaries of life, but to all its comforts and luxuries are
altogether unknown.

The land of a colony having no natural limit, if the government do not
place some artificial limit on the appropriation of it by individuals,
every individual in the colony is tempted to become a land-owner and
cultivator. Hence two kinds of evil. If each individual, or any great
number of individuals, take more land than each can cultivate, the
people are dispersed over a wide extent of country, and are separated
from each other by intervening deserts. If each person appropriate no
more land than he is able to cultivate, still, all being independent
proprietors, both capital and labour are divided into fractions as
numerous as the cultivators. In either case, society is almost
dissolved. The people, whether separated by distance, or, however near
they may be to each other, by each one becoming an independent
land-owner, are all of one class: there is no class of capitalists, no
class of labourers; nor indeed any classification, all being the same.
But all being alike, each one is independent of all the others; and, in
this state of things (we must not say, society) it is impossible that
large masses of capital and many hands should be employed in the same
work, at the same time, and for a long period. And yet, without
constancy and combination in the employment of capital and labour, the
produce obtained never was, and never can be, large in proportion to the
capital and labour. Unless the produce be large in proportion to the
capital and labour employed in raising it, it cannot be cheap enough for
exchange in distant markets; and thus a people, whose capital and labour
were divided as in the supposed case, would necessarily be without
foreign commerce. When, too, all are of the same class, or rather, there
are no classes, all raise the same kind of produce; and there is no
motive for exchange amongst the cultivators themselves. The labour,
moreover, of each cultivator who does everything for himself, is
necessarily divided amongst so many occupations, that only a small
portion of it can be bestowed on the work of production; and thus, even
if the settlers should have a motive for dealing with each other, no two
of them would have any surplus produce to exchange. The result is, that
civilized men fall into a state of but half-civilization; preserving,
indeed, the knowledge and tools of their former condition, and, by
applying these to very rich land, raising plenty of mere necessaries,
but losing the powers which arise from mutual assistance, and the wants,
tastes, and habits which belong to an advanced society.

In every colony of modern times these evils have resulted, in a greater
or less degree, from an excessive proportion of land, and, in most of
such colonies, have been partially counteracted by the greater evil of
Negro slavery; as, for example, in the West Indies, North America,
Brazil, and South Africa. For, whatever the proportion of land, even
where it was so great that every freeman became a land-owner, still,
with slavery, with human beings who could be prevented from obtaining
land, there was constant and combined labour with which to employ large
masses of capital in raising a produce cheap enough for distant markets.
In the prosperous settlements of New South Wales and Van Dieman’s Land
convicts have, to some extent, supplied the want of slaves. But those
colonies, without any exception, in which there has been superabundance
of land without Edition: current; Page: [742] any kind of slavery, have
been eminently poor and barbarous;* and the last colony founded by
Englishmen6 affords a striking example of the evils resulting from
excess of land.

[Pp. 89-92.]

To counteract this natural tendency of every new settlement, it is
intended to fix such a price upon all grants of land as shall prevent
the occupation of land from outstripping the growth of population, so
that the existing population shall at all times be sufficient for the
cultivation of all the land which is occupied, and for raising the other
articles of all kinds required by the producers. The proceeds of the
sales of land will be applied to further emigration. The attempt will be
to make the new colony, not, as the Courier represents, “as like an old
country as possible”7 (for old countries are mostly over-crowded, and it
is not necessary to be in one extreme in order to avoid the other) but
to make it as like as possible to a country which is perfectly
civilized, but not over-peopled. The proportion of land to labour and
capital, in England, is too small; in the backwoods of America, too
great: between these two extremes there is a proportion which is the
best possible, and to which the founders of the new colony will
endeavour to approximate.

If a tract of fertile land, equal in extent to Yorkshire, were to appear
off the Land’s End to-morrow morning, no one can doubt that the quantity
of labour and capital, which would speedily flow into it from England,
would raise both wages and profits throughout the country, and that all
the industrious classes, labourers, and capitalists together, would be
rendered far more comfortable and contented than at present. But if the
land which rose from the ocean, close to our shores, instead of being
only as large as Yorkshire, were as large as America, and our people
were, in the same manner, to spread over it, taking their capital with
them, we should fall back into a savage state. A wise government would
therefore endeavour so to provide, that not the whole, but only a
portion, equal to Yorkshire, should be occupied at first, and the rest
progressively, as population and capital increased. The same is the
purpose of the new colony. The aim will be so to limit the appropriation
and occupation of land, as to keep both wages and profits at the highest
rate possible.

We conclude by most strongly recommending this little tract to the
perusal of all who are interested, either as citizens, in the means of
relieving the industry of their country from the evils of an
over-crowded society, or as individuals, in withdrawing themselves
personally from those evils.

policy which that master finds it convenient to abandon, we shall know
hereafter.

265.: THE POOR LAW BILL
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 2 AUG., 1834, P. 4

Mill returns to the Morning Chronicle for another discussion of the Poor
Law (see No. 252). This unheaded article is described in his
bibliography as “A leading article on the Poor Law Bill in the Morning
Chronicle of 2d August 1834”

(MacMinn, p. 41).

the poor law bill may now be considered as passed;1 and passed without
any material deterioration, perhaps even with some improvement upon the
project as it was first submitted to Parliament. But Ministers must not
consider their object accomplished, and their responsibility at an end.
The difficulties of their task are either terminated, or only beginning,
according to the skill and judgment which they demonstrate in the choice
of instruments for carrying the bill into execution. The bill itself is
not a reform—it only authorizes the appointment of officers to effect a
reform. The whole success of the measure depends upon the choice of the
Central Commissioners.2 If these be but half acquainted with the
subject; if Edition: current; Page: [744] they be not thoroughly
impressed with the principles of the bill; or if they be destitute of
the practical sagacity requisite for doing what it is left to them to
do, namely, to devise means adapted to the varying circumstances of
different districts and parishes, for carrying those general principles
into effect—if they be either timid, wavering, and undecided, or
incautious and precipitate, they will certainly defeat all the hopes
entertained of them; they will bring disgrace upon the bill and its
authors, and may, not improbably, verify the predictions of its enemies,
by throwing the whole country into a flame.

The difficulty of the choice would be less, if the services of the late
Poor Law Commissioners could be obtained for carrying into operation the
measures which they have planned.3 But it is understood that none of
those gentlemen have applied for employment under the new Act, and there
is not more than one of them, at most, whose circumstances and
avocations are not incompatible, not only with his seeking, but with his
accepting such employment. We trust, however, that the Commissioners,
who, as the authors of the measure, are the best judges of the
qualifications necessary for carrying it into effect, and who have as
strong an interest in its success as Ministers themselves have, will be
the advisers of Government in the selection of the new functionaries,
and that no false delicacy will prevent them from watching with parental
vigilance the arrangements upon which it will depend whether the
enactment, which is their offspring, will be a blessing to the country
which has adopted it, or a mere nullity, or an actual curse.

266.: FRENCH NEWS [103]
 EXAMINER, 17 AUG., 1834, P. 520

This article is headed “London, August 17, 1834.” This and Nos. 268 and
269 (the last series Mill wrote on French politics for the Examiner) are
described in his bibliography as “The summary of French news in the
Examiner of 17th, 24th and 31st August 1834” (MacMinn, p. 41). In Mill’s
copy of the Examiner in Somerville College, this account is listed as
“Article on France.”

a few weeks ago, we had the satisfaction of stating that the highest
tribunal in France, the Court of Cassation, had, through its Criminal
Committee, solemnly vindicated the liberty of the Press against one of
the most impudent outrages ever sought to be inflicted upon it—the
sentence by which the interdiction pronounced against the National was
extended to the new journal established in its room, the National de
1834. Our congratulations, however, were premature. The Court of
Cassation has reversed the decision of its Committee, and confirmed the
original sentence of the Cour Royale.1

1st, Behold, then, the state of French law, as established by a series
of judicial decisions. A Court of Justice may try and condemn a
newspaper, without a jury, for any article containing reflections on its
own proceedings—that is, provided the cause it is called upon to decide
be its own cause.

2dly, The Court, thus empowered to revenge its own supposed injuries,
may interdict the offending newspaper from giving any further reports
of, or remarks upon, its own proceedings—that is, it may peremptorily
silence all censure upon itself.

Lastly, if the newspaper thus partially confiscated be dropped, and
another paper established by the same parties, the new paper shall
remain subject to the interdict.

Such is French law, French liberty, under the King of the Barricades and
French Judges.

The Tribune newspaper—which, after nearly a hundred prosecutions, was
arbitrarily suppressed in April last, and the license (for in France all
printers must be licensed) withdrawn from its printer—this paper has at
last succeeded in finding another licensed printer, who is willing to
incur the risk of a similar confiscation of his means of livelihood. The
Tribune has now reappeared.2

The Chambers have met. In verifying the elections, the Chamber of
Deputies has displayed partiality so gross as to have incurred the
censure of even the Journal des Débats.3 The debate on the Address has
commenced, and promises to be an animated one.4 The Address will be
either a compromise, or a trial of strength, between the Doctrinaires
and the tiers parti, or Dupin party. The former are aristocrats on
principle, and would have preferred old institutions, and the old
dynasty, with an old British constitution; the latter are the incarnate
spirit of modern bourgeois oligarchy—which is for levelling down to
itself, but no lower. The latter are a more genuine offspring of the
present institutions of France, and will, we have no doubt, ultimately
supplant the others if those institutions last, and no new revolution,
legal or violent, comes between and parts the combatants.


267.: GARNIER’S DEUTSCHES LEBEN, KUNST, UND POESIE [1]
 EXAMINER, 24 AUG., 1834, P. 533

Mill here merely announces an account (No. 270), of the first number of
a short-lived periodical edited by Joseph Heinrich Garnier (ca.
1800-55), a German refugee journalist and translator with whom Mill was
acquainted, and who later contributed to the London (and London and
Westminster) Review and Henry Cole’s Guide. The unheaded note is in the
“Literary Examiner.” Described in Mill’s bibliography as “A short
paragraph in the Examiner of 24th August, on Garnier’s German
periodical: ‘Deutsches Leben, Kunst und Poesie’ ” (MacMinn, p. 42), the
notice is listed in Mill’s copy of the Examiner in Somerville College,
as “Paragraph on a German Periodical ‘Deutsches Leben.’ ”

we postpone till next week a notice of a new German periodical, intitled
Deutsches Leben, Kunst, und Poesie. We had intended to say something of
its very interesting and lively Prospectus; but we shall now defer our
observations until we have read the first number, which has just
appeared.


268.: FRENCH NEWS [104]
 EXAMINER, 24 AUG., 1834, P. 536

This item is headed “London, August 24, 1834.” For Mill’s bibliographic
entry, see No. 266. In the Somerville College set of the Examiner, the
article is listed as “Paragraphs on France.”

Edition: current; Page: [747]
to the astonishment of all Paris, the Address drawn up by the
tiers-parti, and filled with implied reflections upon the Ministry, has
been allowed to pass the Chamber without opposition. The
Ministry—feeling well that the Chamber, notwithstanding these
demonstrations of coquetry, would support, as the last Chamber has done,
all their measures—were probably averse to put themselves unnecessarily
on the defensive, and, therefore, would not understand the allusions in
the Address.

Immediately after receiving the King’s answer to the Address,1 the
Chambers were prorogued to the 29th of December.


269.: FRENCH NEWS [105]
 EXAMINER, 31 AUG., 1834, P. 552

This item is headed “London, August 31, 1834.” For Mill’s bibliographic
entry for this, his last summary of French news in the Examiner, see No.
266. In the Somerville College set of the Examiner, it is listed as
“Paragraphs on France.”

the only event worthy of record which has occurred in France since our
last publication, is the victory of M. Carrel over another attempt to
crush him by the hands of the law. The prosecution was for a libel on
the King, consisting in some disrespectful strictures on
Louis-Philippe’s Speech to the Chambers.1 M. Carrel defended himself in
person; and maintained that, if the King chuses to be his own Minister,
he must be subject to the same freedom of censure as any other
Minister—else he were a despot. The jury agreed with this view of the
case, and M. Carrel was triumphantly acquitted.2

The Temps thus observes upon this victory:

The National, which during the last two years has been dragged from one
tribunal to another, in consequence of a decision of exceptional
justice, has at length been brought before a proper tribunal, that of
the country, in the Court of Assizes held this day. The charge brought
this time against the National by the public prosecutor3 was that of a
direct attack on the person of the King, made on the occasion of the
Royal speech, delivered at Edition: current; Page: [748] the opening of
the Chambers. It pleaded “not guilty,” on the ground that the personal
and active part taken by the King in the administration of the
Government dispensed that paper from the observance of the law which
prescribes that the Royal acts shall be free from censure when they are
constitutional. The country has, through its organ, the jury,
consecrated that doctrine for the tenth time on this occasion, and
absolved the press, doubtless for the purpose of evincing in a striking
manner its disapprobation of a violation of principles which the true
friends of the constitution and the monarchy have every day cause to
deplore.4


270.: GARNIER’S DEUTSCHES LEBEN, KUNST, UND POESIE [2]
 EXAMINER, 14 SEPT., 1834, P. 581

For the context, see No. 267. The review, the only article in the
“Literary Examiner,” is headed “Deutsches Leben, Kunst, und Poesie.
Herausgegeben: von J.H. Garnier, No. I and II.” It is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A notice of the first two numbers of Garnier’s
German Periodical ‘Deutsches Leben, Kunst und Poesie’ in the Examiner of
14th September 1834” (MacMinn, p. 42). In the Somerville College set of
the Examiner, it is listed as “Review of ‘Deutsches Leben’ ”; it is the
last item listed by Mill in that set.

this is, we believe, the first German periodical ever published in
England; the founder, Mr. Garnier, was the editor of the Swabian Liberal
(Freisinnige),1 and was, we believe, compelled to quit Germany, because
he had become obnoxious to the government; but his journal is by no
means exclusively political. Indeed, the first number is wholly
literary, and consists chiefly of a review, with copious extracts, of
the poems of Heine, one of the cleverest of the young German writers,
also driven from his country in consequence of his political opinions.2
Some of the shorter poems, extracted by Mr. Garnier, from Heine’s
volume, are extremely beautiful, and will, we hope, contribute to make
the author advantageously known in this country.

The following passage from Mr. Garnier’s prospectus, announces the
notion he entertains of the function of a literary critic, and this
notion is so remote from the vulgar one, that we cannot refuse ourselves
the pleasure of translating it.

Aesthetic subtleties and system work, empty prattle on the beautiful and
the not-beautiful, we abandon to the time-killers and the bel esprit
journals, for the amusement of fine ladies, so abundant in Germany. We
seek in the writer, above all, the Edition: current; Page: [749] man.
How he, in and for himself, figures himself to us from his writings, we
shall endeavour to unfold; and when we have pictured to ourselves the
man, we shall next inquire what phasis, if any, of German life, he and
his existence are the reflexion of; in what manner the age, and his
individual circumstances, have influenced the formation of his character
as a man and as a writer; or, on the other hand, what influence he
himself has exercised on the age and on his circumstances; and, in this
perpetual reference to actual life, many political leanings may possibly
evince themselves, not, we conceive, without cause. This political
tendency we shall least of all be able to avoid, if we likewise
endeavour to show what the writer did not become, in consequence of the
wretchedness of his times; and how often the fairest flowers of the
German mind have, by the pressure of circumstances, been snapped off, or
prevented from duly unfolding themselves. For it is not the greatness of
many of our writers which ought to astonish us, but often that it was
possible for them to attain any greatness whatever.3

The second number is more miscellaneous than the first. The longest
article relates to the unfortunate Caspar Hauser, whose real parentage
the author believes himself to have made out.4 We are not yet
sufficiently masters of his theory, and of the grounds of it, to express
any opinion of our own on the subject.

Mr. Garnier is evidently a man of considerable acquirements and talents,
and of some humour; and we heartily wish him success. Harro Harring, the
well-known author of Poland under the Dominion of Russia,5 will, it
seems, shortly arrive in England, to take a share in the editorship of
this work; and the aid of other German writers of reputation is
confidently promised by Mr. Garnier.


271.: NEW AUSTRALIAN COLONY
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 23 OCT., 1834, P. 3

Mill’s last newspaper contribution in 1834 is his first letter to the
editor of an English journal since 30 Oct., 1828 (No. 42). Taking up the
central issue of Nos. 259, 261, and 263, it is headed as title and
described in his bibliography as “A letter in the Morning Chronicle of
23d Oct. 1834, signed A.B. and headed ‘New Australian Colony’ ”

(MacMinn, p. 42).

sir,—The letter which you inserted on Tuesday, respecting the new colony
in Southern Australia, evidently proceeds from a writer thoroughly
acquainted with Edition: current; Page: [750] the subject;1 and if I
were certain that it would attract the attention of the newly-appointed
Commissioners for the government of the colony,2 I should not have
troubled you with any remarks on a subject which has been treated in so
masterly a manner by your correspondent. But the question on which he
chiefly insists is of such vital importance to all the objects of the
colony, that so long as it is undecided, you will not, perhaps, grudge
to devote a portion of your columns to its further discussion.

It would be far better, that the colony had never been thought of, it
would be far better it should be thought of no more, than that the price
for which land may be purchased in the colony should be so low as 12s.
per acre, or even 1l. or 2l.

This must be clear to all who consider the principle on which the
peculiarity of the proposed colony is founded. Other colonies have
advanced slowly, because every family settles on its own piece of land,
attempts to produce for itself all that it requires, and there is no
combination of labour, no home market, no division of employments,
because there are no hired labourers. Accordingly, the plan of the
present colony is so framed as to secure a constant supply of hired
labourers. It is not intended, far from it, that the labourer should
continue a labourer all his life: it is desired that every labourer
should in time become a landholder, but not until another labourer has
arrived from Europe to take his place.

Now, your correspondent has clearly shown that if land can be obtained
at 12s. an acre, every labourer will be able to become a landholder in
less than a year. If so, there will be the same scarcity of labour as in
the old colonies; the labourer, when established as a landholder, will
depend solely upon the labour of his own family; there will be the same
absence of combination, the same absence of a market for anything except
food, the same want of motive to produce anything but the commonest
necessaries of life, the same absence of society, of comforts, of
civilization, as in the wilds of Canada. If so, it were far better that
the colony should never be formed. There are enough, and more than
enough, of colonies on the old absurd system.

The Commissioners, being men who understand the subject, are, doubtless,
well aware of the necessity of a high minimum price; and, if they fix it
too low, it will not be for want of knowing better, but for fear lest
the object should be misunderstood, and emigrants induced, by the high
price of land, to prefer some of the old colonies. But this is a chance
which must be undergone. Let the Edition: current; Page: [751] reasons
for fixing a high price be explained as fully and as clearly as
possible, to all who are disposed to emigrate; but do not, to conciliate
emigrants, sacrifice the only object for which the colony is established
at all.

Perhaps the Commissioners may think of compromising the matter, by
fixing the minimum price at 12s. or 1l., and selling all the land by
auction, with that for the upset price; by which means they would obtain
a higher than the minimum price for all the lots which are most eligibly
situated. Now, the chief object of my writing the present letter is, to
point out that this will not remedy the evil. So long as land of good
quality can be had for cultivation at 12s. an acre, it is of no
consequence that an acre of ground in a town may perhaps produce ten
pounds. It is not the average price, but the lowest price, which
determines the degree of concentration of the people. With the present
artificial feelings of our labourers about property in land, they will
spread themselves out on the outer verge of the colony, where land may
be had at no more than the upset price; the labourers who first go out
will become landholders in the first year, and there will be but few
labourers to succeed them; every colonist will be a producer of food;
there will be no purchasers for any surplus of food, and no producers
for anything to give in exchange for food. Each family will have food in
abundance, and nothing else.

The only advantage of selling the land by auction is, that a larger
emigration-fund would be afforded than could be obtained at the same
minimum price if the minimum were also the maximum. But this is a very
trifling advantage. Considering the distance of the colony, and the
expense of transport, a slight increase of the emigration-fund would by
no means occasion labour to flow into the colony in sufficient abundance
to supply the places of the first labourers so rapidly as those places
would be vacated, if the minimum price were too low. It would be far
better to fix the minimum sufficiently high from the beginning, and
never to take more than the minimum for any land whatever. Those who
might otherwise be deterred by the high minimum price from settling in
the colony at all, would be no longer so, if, by paying that price, they
purchased the chance of obtaining lots which could be resold at once for
treble the value.

The one thing needful is a high minimum price; and this would probably
be more easily obtained by renouncing the disposal of lands by auction
altogether.

I am, Sir, yours respectfully,

A.B.

The July elections had returned 265 members new to the Chamber (rather
more than the 200 Mill estimates). Consequently, when it reconvened on
23 July, its political complexion was uncertain. Périer had won the
fight over the election of the President of the Chamber by only one
vote; therefore, the debate on the Address to the King from 9 to 16 Aug.
(Moniteur, 1831, pp. 1328-1405), which concentrated on Périer’s position
that France should not go to war for a principle or a doctrine, was
crucial. The left lost the vote by 282 to 73.

The first settlement of freed slaves was started in Sierra Leone in 1787
but had to be revived in 1791. In 1808 the British government took over
the colony, and in the next fifty years about 50,000 Negroes taken from
illegal slavers were settled there. Fernando Po, an island off the
Guinea Coast, had been settled by the Spanish as a source for slaves.
Driven off by yellow fever in 1781, Spain leased bases to Britain after
1807 for the navy in its attempt to police the slave trade. Liberia’s
first freed slaves arrived in 1822 after a six-year struggle by the
American Colonization Society.

Tobago and St. Lucia in the Caribbean and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean
were assigned to Britain by the first Treaty of Paris in May 1814 (PP,
1813-14, XIV, 227-65, Art. 8); Demerara, Berbice, and Essequibo (British
Guiana) were ceded by the Dutch in August 1814. Tobago, however, had
since the early seventeenth century been in British, Dutch, and French
hands, and may be considered an “old” slave island. Trinidad may be
considered a “new” one, as it had been ceded by Spain to Britain by the
Treaty of Amiens in 1802.

The Censeur was founded by Charles Comte in 1814. Several times

Périer and Soult had brought charges against Ferdinand Bascans
(1801-61), manager of La Tribune 1829-35, Armand Marrast (1801-52),
author of an article, “Situation grave,” written for La Tribune, of 9
Sept., 1831, and Vincent Ferrare François Antony Thouret (1807-71),
manager of the Révolution de 1830, which printed it after the
authorities had prevented its appearance in La Tribune. The article
asserted that Périer and Soult had each received a gift of wine during
the purchase of some English guns. The trial took place at the end of
October; only Marrast was found guilty, and sentenced to six months’
imprisonment, a 3,000-franc fine, and expenses. The affair is described
in Le National, 31 Oct., pp. 2-4.

The Périer ministry brought the bill (see No. 115, n1) to the Peers on
19 Dec. (Moniteur, 1831, pp. 2429-32) where, after prolonged debate on
the 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 26th, and 27th, its approval was completed on the
28th (ibid., pp. 2534-6).

2
Georges Léopold Nicolas Frédéric Dagobert, baron Cuvier (1769-1832),
naturalist. Perhaps Mill had in mind Cuvier’s uninterruptedly successful
career at the University under Napoleon and the Restoration.

*
Our friend of the Globe says, “the persons selected have, without
exception, been taken from those whose political principles alone
excluded them (before the late revolution) from all participation in the
favour and honours of the court.” [Leading article, Globe and Traveller,
24 Nov., 1831, p. 2.] Surely this was written in a moment of
inadvertency. What amusement it will excite in Paris! Political
principles and M. le Conseiller-d’état baron Cuvier. It is a specimen of
the average degree of knowledge possessed by our newspapers on French
affairs, that they have all of them (with scarcely an exception, save
the Morning Chronicle) eulogized this list of peers as most admirably
selected. [See the article by “O.P.Q.” (Caleb Charles Colton), in
Morning Chronicle, 24 Nov., 1831, p. 2, which begins: “Unhappy France!
Unfortunate King!”]

3
Philippe Paul, comte de Ségur (1780-1873), who, when his highly
successful military career ended with Napoleon’s defeat, turned to the
writing of history.

4
Joseph Napoléon Ney, prince de la Moskowa (1803-57), general, who had
married Laffitte’s daughter in 1828 and was already a captain in the
hussars, was the son of Napoleon’s Marshal Michel Ney, prince de la
Moskowa (1769-1815) who, having been executed in 1815, was considered by
many as a martyr to the Restoration. (For more on the father, see No.
132, n9.) Maximilien Sébastien Auguste Arthur Louis Fernand (not
Bernard), comte Foy (1815-71), still a minor, was the son of Sébastien
Maximilien Foy (1775-1825), who had been a very popular general and
orator.

For that vote and Mill’s comments, see No. 124.

6
Art. 33 (the provision), and Art. 68 (the promise of enactment in 1831).

7
I.e., by the Charter of 1814.

8
For the origin of this impasse, see No. 120, n3. Louis Philippe’s
refusal would appear to have been motivated by a concern to defend the
royal prerogative against the infringement of the King’s right to confer
military rank. On 21 Nov., the Ministry reported the King’s
unwillingness, and presented an alternative bill (Moniteur, 1831, pp.
2193-4), enacted as Bull. 61, No. 142 (15 Feb., 1832), confirming the
pensions such ranks would obtain.

The silk weavers of Lyons had complained of low wages. After
negotiations, the Prefect proclaimed a higher scale, but on 10 Nov., the
manufacturers repudiated it. Trouble began on 20 Nov., and by the 22nd
the insurrectionists were in control; there was little bloodshed or
looting.

4
A mob demonstrated against Charles Wetherell, the Recorder of Bristol
and an extreme opponent of the Reform Bill, when he went there to open
the assizes on 29 Oct.; the disturbance grew to a riot and next day the
bishop’s palace was burnt, among other outrages.

*
It is curious, that the very newspaper which gave to the English public
the first intelligence that English competition had starved the silk
weavers of Lyons into rebellion, contained an account of a meeting of
English silk-manufacturers at Coventry, to represent to the Board of
Trade their inability to maintain the competition with French silks; and
to urge the revival of the old prohibitory laws, which had rendered our
silk manufacture (we use the expression of an extensive silk dealer) a
disgrace to the country. [Prohibited by 48 George III, c. 22 (1808), the
importation of silks was permitted again (after July 1826) by 5 George
IV, c. 21 (1824); the meeting is reported in “The Riband Trade of
Coventry,” Morning Herald, 28 Nov., 1831, p. 4.]

That sapient journal, the Morning Herald, points to the insurrection at
Lyons as a specimen of the consequences of free trade! [Leading article,
Morning Herald, 28 Nov., 1831, p. 2.] The silk-weavers of Lyons are
ruined, we suppose, by being admitted to our markets; for we know not of
any other “free trade” which has come into operation with regard to
them.

5
Louis Bouvier-Dumolart (1780-1855), who had held several administrative
and financial posts under Napoleon, was appointed Prefect of Lyons by
Périer; for his proclamation sanctioning the increase, see Moniteur,
1831, p. 1998.

Bull. 462, No. 10886 (4 July, 1821), esp. Art. 3.

For the introduction of the Bill, see No. 125, n2. The committee was
appointed on 20 Oct. (Moniteur, 1831, p. 1916).

1
By 5 Dec. the insurrection was over, and the National Guard and a
garrison of 20,000 soldiers had been established in the city. For Mill’s
earlier account, see No. 130.

2
The reports on the insurrection can be followed from the announcement on
24 Nov. of its outbreak (Moniteur, 1831, p. 2217) to that of the
re-establishment of order on 7 Dec. (ibid., p. 2327).

3
When a group of students and members of radical clubs announced their
intention of holding a meeting at the Place de la Bastille on 14 July,
1831, the Prefect issued a proclamation on the 13th calling them enemies
of the people and troublemakers, and promising that justice would be
done to them. The next day the meeting was disrupted by hirelings.
Articles implying that Périer and Alexandre François Vivien (1799-1854),
Prefect of the Paris police, were privy to the incident had appeared in
Le National on 15, 16, 17, and 18 July, and in La Tribune on 16 and 17
July, for which the managing editors of Le National, J.B. Alexandre
Paulin (1793-1859), and of La Tribune, Ferdinand Bascans, were
prosecuted under the provisions of Art. 8 of Bull. 241, No. 8754 (18
July, 1828).

4
Moniteur, 15 July, 1831, p. 1215, uses the word “agitateurs,” but no
original for “eternal enemies of order” has been found.

5
Enacted as Bull. 78, No. 178 (28 Apr., 1832); see No. 119. Mill is
presumably referring to Art. 1, the simplicity of which must have
appeared wonderful to someone who lived without codified laws and had
edited Bentham; it reads: “Les art. 206, 339, 340, 341, 345, 347, 368,
372, 399 et 619 du Code d’instruction criminelle sont abrogés; ils
seront remplacés par les articles suivans.”

Louis Henri Joseph, duc de Bourbon, prince de Condé (1756-1830), as
husband of Louise d’Orléans, sister of Philippe-Egalité, was uncle of
Louis Philippe. Separated from his wife, he was dominated by his
mistress, Mme de Feuchères (née Sophie Dawes, 1795-1841). To protect her
position in his will, she sought the friendship of the Orléans family,
and persuaded the duc to appoint as his heir Louis Philippe’s son, Henri
Eugène Philippe Louis d’Orléans, duc d’Aumale (1822-97). The duc de
Bourbon had apparently planned to leave Mme de Feuchères, but before he
could accomplish his escape, he was found on the morning of 27 Aug.,
1830, hanging by two handkerchiefs from the fastening of a window. It
was pronounced a suicide. The heir-at-law—actually “heirs-at-law”—who
disputed the will were the princes of Rohan (q.v. in App. J).

5
Moniteur, 1831, pp. 2337-44 and 2345-6.

6
See ibid., pp. 2339 and 2341; Mill somewhat distorts Dupin’s views.

7
Auguste, baron Portalis (1801-55), lawyer, a deputy elected in 1831,
introduced on 6 Dec., 1831, Proposition ayant pour but d’abroger la loi
du 18 novembre 1814, relative au travail des dimanches et des fêtes
(Moniteur, 1831, p. 2319). It went no farther at that time, and after
being reintroduced on 11 Feb., 1832 (ibid., 1832, p. 425), it died on
the order paper.

8
On the same day that he brought in the proposition cited in n7, Portalis
introduced Proposition tendant à abroger la loi du 19 janvier 1816,
relative au deuil public du 21 janvier (Moniteur, 1831, p. 2319), with
reference to Bull. 63, No. 401 (19 Jan., 1816). Approved by the Deputies
on 23 Dec., it was rejected by the Peers on 3 Mar., 1832 (ibid., 1831,
pp. 2472-3; 1832, pp. 642-3).

9
Thomas Arthur, comte de Lally (1702-66), Governor of the French
possessions in India, was captured in 1761 at Pondicherry and taken to
England. When he returned to Versailles (his British captors having
released him on his word to return) to face his French detractors, he
was imprisoned by a lettre de cachet for nineteen months in the
Bastille, and after a disgracefully unfair trial, beheaded for treason
on 9 May, 1766. Marshal Michel Ney, having been one of Napoleon’s best
loved and most loyal generals, negotiated the peace in 1814, and
welcomed Louis XVIII back to Paris; he then fought for Napoleon during
the Hundred Days, and was proscribed in 1815. Though he believed himself
protected by Art. 12 of the terms of capitulation (see “Convention” [3
July, 1815], Moniteur, 1815, p. 765), he was tried as a traitor and
executed before a firing squad on 7 Dec., 1815.

10
Salverte introduced, on 7 Dec., Proposition pour la reprise à une autre
session des travaux législatifs non terminés dans la session précédente
(Moniteur, 1831, p. 2327).

The debate lasted four days, 19-22 Dec. (ibid., pp. 2438-40, 2442-50,
2451-8, 2462-6).

3
For the Bill and its enactment, see No. 125, n2.

4
Jean Georges Humann (1780-1842), a liberal deputy since 1820, supported
the 221 and the July Revolution. He was a protectionist.

5
Jules Frédéric Auguste Amédée, baron Laguette-Mornay (1780-1845), a
moderate deputy since 1827, supported the July Revolution and free
trade. For the speech on 12 Dec. referred to, see Moniteur, 1831, p.
2371.

10
The Proposition relative à la loi dudivorce was introduced by Auguste
Jean Marie, baron de Schonen (1782-1849), on 11 Aug., 1831; it passed
the Deputies on 15 Dec., but was rejected by the Peers on 28 Mar., 1832.
(See Moniteur, 1831, pp. 1352, 2390-6 [the debate Mill is referring to],
and 1832, pp. 897-900.) Divorce had been abolished by Bull. 84, No. 645
(8 May, 1816), which had revoked the provision of the Code Napoléon
(Bull. 154 bis, No. 2653 bis [3 Sept., 1807]) in Livre I, Titre VI,
Chaps. i-v. Divorce was not reintroduced in France until 1884.

reference to Périer’s speech and the debate, see No. 133, nn1 and 2.

3
Bouvier-Dumolart attended the debate on 20 Dec., and accosted Périer as
he was leaving the Chamber, calling him a liar (Moniteur, 1831, p.
2446).

4
The reason for Bouvier-Dumolart’s resignation is given in his letter to
the editor (20 Dec.), Constitutionnel, 21 Dec., p. 4. Five of his
letters on the events in Lyons, dated 22-26 Dec., are ibid., 23-27 Dec.
Extracts from letters by Bouvier-Dumolart to Périer and d’Argout, dated
11, 22, 25, 27, 28 Oct., and 6, 12, 19 Nov., were read in the Chamber of
Deputies in their speeches on the disturbances in Lyons (Moniteur, 1831,
pp. 2444-8). Mill calls Bouvier-Dumolart Prefect of the Rhône.

The founding of the Institut National was provided for in Art. 298 of
Constitution de la république française of 1795. Subsequently, Daunou
presented the Report of the Education Committee to the National
Convention on 19 Oct. (Moniteur, 1795, pp. 128, 130-1), on the basis of
which was enacted Bull. 203, No. 1216 (25 Oct., 1795); Titre IV

Le National was founded by Messrs. Thiers, Mignet, Sautelet, and Carrel
in January 1830 to work for the overthrow of the Polignac ministry.
After the July Revolution, it was under the direction of Carrel, who
supported Louis Philippe until Périer took office in the spring of 1831.
Growing progressively more exasperated with the regime, Le National
declared itself republican in 1832. See also No. 131, n3.

For the Society, see No. 57, n3. The accused were Louis Auguste Blanqui
(1805-81), who had joined the staff of Le Globe in 1829 and, after
fighting in the July Revolution, had become bitterly disappointed by its
outcome; Henri Bonnias (b. 1800), publicist and dramatist; François
Guillaume Gervais de Caen (1803-67), doctor and administrator; François
Vincent Raspail (1794-1878), chemist, who, after participating in the
July Revolution became President of the Society; and Vincent Thouret,
also active in and then disappointed by the July Revolution. Tried for
their collection entitled Au peuple, they were sentenced by the judge
Simon Edme Paul Jacquinot-Godard (1779-1858), Bonnias and Raspail to
fifteen months’ imprisonment and 500 francs fine, Blanqui to one year
and 200 francs, and Gervais and Thouret to six months and 100 francs.

Mill is probably referring to the account in La Tribune, but would have
seen Paul Rochette, “Procès des quinze,” Le Globe, 14 Jan., 1832, pp.
1-2, which includes Blanqui’s speech.

The reference is to No. 135, where, however, Mill is concerned with
Bouvier-Dumolart’s rather than Cormenin’s quarrel with Périer.

No copy of this paper has been located. John Cam Hobhouse, Baron
Broughton de Gyfford (1786-1869), reforming M.P. for Westminster since
1820, initiated 1 & 2 William IV, c. 39 (1831), which applied only to

The followers of Claude Henri, comte de Saint-Simon (1760-1825), had
formed, on quasi-religious, quasi-economic theories, communes wherein
they could put into practice their views on co-operative living. They
were accused of teaching anti-social doctrines subversive of the
established order (see the Saint-Simonian organ, Le Globe, 23 Jan.,
1832, p. 2). Those prosecuted were Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin
(1796-1864), sociologist, who met and was converted by Saint-Simon in
1825, becoming head of the sect; Pierre Ange Casimir Emile Barrault
(1799-1896), one of the principal editors of Le Globe; Michel Chevalier
(1806-79), another of the editors of Le Globe; Charles Duveyrier
(1803-66), another of the editors, who was then visiting London with
d’Eichthal and spent some time in Mill’s company; and Benjamin Olinde
Rodrigues (1794-1851), economist and reformer.

“Todmorden, Feb. 2, 1832. / Sir,—Living, as we do, in the densely
populated manufacturing districts of Lancashire, and most of us
belonging to that class of females who earn their bread either directly
or indirectly by manufactories, we have looked with no little anxiety
for your opinion on the Factory Bill, because we consider that you have
not only the real welfare of the working classes at heart, but we are so
impressed with the idea of your profound knowledge in these matters,
that to dispute the soundness of any opinion seriously put forth by the
editor of the Examiner, is considered by us a great work of presumption.
Your notice, this week, of the address of the Dundee Operatives, has
supplied us with the knowledge we sought. You are for doing away with
our services in manufactories altogether. So much the better, if you had
pointed out any other more eligible and practical employment for the
surplus female labour, that will want other channels for a subsistence.
If our competition were withdrawn, and short hours substituted, we have
no doubt but the effects would be as you have stated, not to lower
wages, as the male branch of the family would be enabled to earn as much
as the whole had done; but for the thousands of females who are employed
in manufactories, who have no legitimate claim on any male relative for
employment or support, and who have, through a variety of circumstances,
been early thrown on their own resources for a livelihood, what is to
become of them? In this neighbourhood, handloom has almost been totally
superseded by power loom weaving, and no inconsiderable number of
females, who must depend on their own exertions, or their parishes for
support, have been forced of necessity into the manufactories, from
their total inability to earn a livelihood at home. It is a lamentable
fact, that in these parts of the country there is scarcely any other
mode of employment for female industry (if we except servitude and
dress-making.) Of the former of these, there is no chance of employment
for one-twentieth of the candidates that would rush into the field, to
say nothing of lowering the wages of our sisters of the same craft, and
of the latter, galling as some of the hardships of manufactories are (of
which the indelicacy of mixing indiscriminately with the men is not the
least), yet there are few women who have been so employed that would
change conditions with the ill-used genteel little slaves, who have to
lose sleep and health in catering to the whims and frivolities of the
butterflies of fashion. We see no way of escape from starvation, but to
accept of the very tempting offers of the newspapers, held out as baits
for us, fairly to ship ourselves off to Van-dieman’s Land, on the very
delicate errand of husband-hunting, and having safely arrived at the
‘Land of Goshen,’ jump ashore, with a ‘who wants me?’ Now then, as we
are a class of society who will be materially affected by any alteration
of the present laws, we put it seriously to you, whether, as you have
deprived us of our means of earning our bread, you are not bound to
point out a more eligible and suitable employment for us? Waiting, with
all humility, for your answer to our request, we have the honour to
subscribe ourselves the constant readers of the Examiner, / The Female
Operatives of Todmorden.”

1831, the Austrian troops had been withdrawn from Italy (for background,
see Nos. 96 and 98), and the Great Powers, including France and England,
drew up memoranda outlining some reforms for the appalling government of
the Papal States, but all was confusion, and in January 1832 Austria was
again asked to send troops. Périer now intervened and offered
encouragement to the rebellious inhabitants of the small seaport of
Ancona, where French troops arrived on 23 Feb. to resist Austrian
encroachment.

The paragraph reads: “The number of cases of cholera which have occurred

official reports of cases, we are assured, are greatly below the truth.
A private correspondent assures us, that one street has actually been
depopulated by the malady. The great majority of the physicians in Paris
do not believe the malady to be contagious. Many attendants at the
hospitals have died from the disease, as it is believed, in consequence
of fatigue having produced a predisposition to the epidemic.”

ministre de l’intérieur, pour l’acquisition de Chambord (1821), in
Oeuvres complètes, Vol. I, pp. 149-74. The ancient château of Chambord,
a superb example of Renaissance architecture situated near Blois, had
been given by Napoleon to Marshal Berthier, but after the Restoration,
his widow, finding it too expensive to maintain, abandoned it. It was
suggested in 1820 that a public subscription be organized to present the
château to the newly-born heir to the monarchy, the son of the duchesse
de Berry. In spite of Courier’s famous attack, which brought the author
two months in prison and a 500-franc fine, the subscription succeeded,
and the duc de Bordeaux became the comte de Chambord.

5
The success of the Foy subscription, which amounted to nearly a million
francs, was noted in The Times in 1826 on 19 and 31 Jan., both p. 2.

Bentham’s ideas found their widest audience (and, incidentally, made
their first great impression on Mill) in the earliest of the French
redactions by Pierre Etienne Louis Dumont (1759-1829), Genevan political
writer, friend of Mirabeau’s, who spent much time in England. He edited
(in order of publication), under Bentham’s name, Traités de législation
civile et pénale, 3 vols. (Paris: Bossange, et al., 1802); Théorie des
peines et des récompenses, 2 vols. (London: Dulau, 1811); Tactique des
assemblées législatives, 2 vols. (Geneva: Paschoud, 1816); and Traité
des preuves judiciaires, 2 vols. (Paris: Bossange, 1823).

We mean the old technical terms and distinctions; for the substantive
provisions of that or any other system of law, must of course consist,
in the far greater proportion, of things useful or unobjectionable.

In A Fragment on Government, ibid., Vol. I, p. 268n, Bentham attributes
the doctrine of utility to David Hume, with reference to “Of Morals,”
Pt. III, Sect. 1, of Hume’s Treatise on Human Nature, 3 vols. (London:
Noon, 1739-40), Vol. III, pp. 1-26.

Mill later, in his Autobiography (see CW, Vol. I, p. 171), attributed
the notion of “many-sidedness” to Goethe, probably referring to the
translation, Characteristics of Goethe. From the German of Falk, Müller,
etc., 3 vols. (London: Wilson, 1833), Vol. I, pp. 12-13, by Sarah
Austin. This reference predates the publication of those volumes, but
Mill, who was in close touch with the Austins, knew of her work earlier
(see CW, Vol. XII, p. 117).

Anne Louis Antoine, baron Clouet (1781-1862), fought for Napoleon, but
went over to the enemy with Bourmont two days before Waterloo. He
returned to France at the Restoration, continuing his army career and
frequently serving under Bourmont, whom he followed in supporting the
duchesse de Berry’s attempt to raise the South.

5
Jacques Joseph Cathelineau (1787-1832), who had served in the garde
royale until 1830, took part in the royalist insurrection and was
treacherously killed. He was the only surviving son of Jacques
Cathelineau (1759-93), a leader of the Vendean counter-revolutionaries
in 1793.

The gist of the quarrel in February can be found in Moniteur, 1832, pp.
438-9. Should Charles X be referred to as “ex-roi,” “roi,” “Charles X,”
or “Charles X, déchu de la royauté”? (The last phrase finally appeared.)
Should he and his descendants be named in the same clause as Napoleon or
in separate ones? (Napoleon got a clause to himself.) Should there be a
forced sale of their possessions or should the State expropriate them at
a fair price? (A sale within a year was decreed.) The Peers lost on most
of the issues.

25
For the beginning of the squabble in January, see Moniteur, 1832, pp.
79-80; the Peers wanted to restrict the budget for 1829 to financial
accounts and rejected clauses that introduced regulations for the
future, the focus settling on two clauses relating to financial
transactions being public and to expenses incurred by a new minister.
The question of prerogatives added ginger to the conflict, which was not
resolved until the passing of Bull. 83, No. 190 (31 Jan., 1833).

26
The justification of this provision of the budget, which took off the
tax provided by Art. 1 of Bull. 38, No. 106 (18 Apr., 1831), was given
by baron Louis, the Minister of Finance, on 19 Aug., 1831 (Moniteur,
1831, pp. 1432-3); the earlier reduction was provided by Bull. 101, No.
3371 (6 July, 1826).

Etienne Joseph Louis Garnier-Pagès (1801-41) was a liberal turned
republican who took part in the July Revolution and afterwards took over
the Société Aide-toi, le ciel t’aidera, and made it republican against
the wishes of the majority. Embittered by the results of the July
Revolution, he sat on the far left, fighting against Louis Philippe’s
governments. Paul Joseph Xavier Tramier de Laboissière (1799-1860),
another deputy of the extreme left, had organized the funeral of General
Lamarque and was involved in the riots. He fled Paris when the warrant
for his arrest was issued. Etienne Cabet (1788-1856), a deputy of the
extreme left, was a member of many republican associations, including
the Société Aide-toi, and had been a “commissaire” at Lamarque’s
funeral.

Henry Warburton (1784?-1858), radical reformer and free trader, one of
the founders (with James Mill and Bentham) of London University, had sat
for Bridport since 1826; John Romilly (1802-74), a liberal, known to
Mill personally through the London Debating Society, was elected for
Bridport.

2
Edward Romilly (1804-70), also a liberal reformer, was elected for
Ludlow. The Clive family had lived in Shropshire since the reign of
Henry II. The “boroughmonger” was Edward Clive (1754-1839), the Earl of
Powis; his nominee was his son, Robert Henry Clive (1789-1854), an
anti-reformer, who, defeated in this constituency, was elected for South
Shropshire.

3
Buller (1806-48), another friend of Mill’s, had been elected to West
Looe in 1830 under the auspices of his uncle, John Buller of Morval
(1771-1849), who had sat for West Looe in 1826-27; John Buller’s younger
brother, Charles (1774-1848; father of Mill’s friend), had also
represented West Looe, 1812-16 and 1826-30. Charles Buller the younger
was, as Mill predicted, elected for Liskeard, replacing the
representative of the St. Germans family, Edward Granville Eliot
(1798-1877), Lord Eliot (later 3rd Earl of St. Germans).

Hawkins (1802-77), barrister, supporter of the ballot, who had sat for
St. Michael’s Mount (Cornwall) in 1830 and Tavistock in 1831-32; he was
elected for Newport in 1832, as was William Henry Ord (1803-38), a
liberal, son of William Ord (1781-1855), Whig reformer, who had
represented Morpeth from 1802 to 1832.

recollect right, a succession of hymns, written and set to music by
themselves.” (EL, CW, Vol. XII, p. 120.)

Pierre Alexandre Joseph Allent (1772-1837), whose successful career in
the army included his being Under-Secretary at the Department of War in
1817, became a deputy in 1828, but became ineligible on the sale of his
property after the July Revolution. Jean Baptiste Maximilien, baron
Villot de Fréville (1773-1847), active in the Revolution, was a member
of the Tribunate under Napoleon. Louis Jacques Thenard (1777-1857), a
brilliant chemist, was a deputy, 1827-31. Victor Cousin (1792-1867),
philosopher, who, after his course at the Sorbonne was suspended in
1821, spent six months in prison. In 1828 he was allowed to return to
the Sorbonne; he supported the July Revolution. Abel François Villemain
(1790-1870), professor of modern history and then of éloquence française
at the Sorbonne, whose course also was suspended by Villèle, was a
deputy, 1830-31, supporting the July Revolution and working on the
revision of the Charter.

Pierre Antoine Berryer (1790-1868) was a lawyer who, although a
royalist, had made himself unpopular with the regime during the
Restoration by his defence of persons prosecuted by the State. He was
sent by the legitimists to dissuade the duchesse de Berry from her
enterprise but failed and was, ironically, arrested. His trial at Blois,
from 15 to 17 Oct., is reported in Moniteur, 1832, pp. 1839, 1845-6,
1849-50, 1851-3.

de Neuville had subsequently been arrested.

In his Rapport et projet de décret sur l’organisation générale de
l’instruction publique (Paris: Imprimerie nationale, 1792), presented to
the National Assembly on 20 and 21 Apr., 1792, Condorcet outlined at
length his proposal for “une société nationale des sciences et des
arts,” with four divisions, of which the second was made up of the moral
and political sciences (pp. 35-55, esp. 37).

Those not identified earlier are Emmanuel Joseph, comte Sieyès
(1748-1836), an abbé very active during the early years of the
Revolution who then helped Napoleon to power; he had been appointed to
the Institut in 1795, and in 1804 to the Académie Française. Dominique
Joseph, comte Garat (1749-1833), originally a professor of history, was
in turn a member of the Estates General, editor of the Journal des
Débats, Minister of Justice, and professor of ideology at l’Ecole
Normale. Philippe Antoine, comte Merlin de Douai (1754-1838), jurist,
statesman, and legal reformer, was reappointed a member of the Institut
in 1830. Pierre Louis, comte Roederer (1754-1835), economist and writer,
active in the early days of the Revolution, editor of the Journal de
Paris, had served Napoleon, then retired into private life in 1815, and
had been dismissed from the Institut in 1816. Marquis Claude Emmanuel
Joseph Pierre de Pastoret (1756-1839) had refused to take the oath to
Louis Philippe in 1830 and remained in the service of Charles X. Jean
Gérard, comte Lacuée de Cessac (1752-1841), military adviser throughout
the Revolution (except for the Terror) and under Napoleon, had been
appointed to the Institut in 1795; on its reorganization in 1803 he had
transferred to the Académie Française. Charles Frédéric, comte Reinhart
(1761-1837), a diplomat, had won many honours, including membership in
the Académies des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres and des Sciences
Morales et Politiques and a peerage in 1832. Joseph Bon, baron Dacier
(1742-1833), historian, first became a member of Inscriptions et Belles
Lettres in 1772 and was its Permanent Secretary from 1782 until it was
closed in 1793; he fled the Terror but returned in 1795 to take part in
the new Institut and the Bibliothèque Nationale; two years later
Napoleon charged him with the task of reorganizing the Institut into
four Académies, and he then became Permanent Secretary of Inscriptions
et Belles Lettres, and in 1823 of the Académie Française.

8
Antoine Louis Claude, comte Destutt de Tracy (1754-1836), philosopher,
had been a member of the Académie Française since 1808. Joseph Marie,
baron de Gérando (1772-1842), philosopher and administrator, had been a
member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres.

9
Those not previously identified are Alexandre Louis Joseph, comte de
Laborde (1773-1842), archeologist and politician, a member of the
Institut in 1813, a liberal deputy in 1820, briefly prefect of the Seine
at the end of the July days, then aide-de-camp to Louis Philippe; and
Joseph Naudet (1786-1878), classicist, who became a member of
Inscriptions et Belles Lettres in 1817.

10
Théodore Simon Jouffroy (1796-1842), philosopher, deputy from 1829; and
Pierre Paul Royer-Collard (1763-1845), political philosopher, member of
the Council of 500 in 1797, a deputy and, in 1828, President of the
Chamber of Deputies.

11
Barthélemy Charles Pierre Joseph Dunoyer (1786-1862), economist and
administrator, friend of Charles Comte; after the July Revolution he
became prefect of Allier. He was elected in December 1832 to the
Académie des Sciences Morales.

12
Cormenin was known for his Du conseil d’état envisagé comme conseil et
comme juridiction sous notre monarchie constitutionnelle (Paris: Pillet,
1818), De la responsabilité des agents du gouvernement (Paris: Baudouin,
1818), and, his chief work, Questions de droit administratif, 2 vols.
(Paris: Ridler, 1822).

1
The Parliamentary History and Review, a radical annual based on
Bentham’s Book of Fallacies, ceased publication in 1828 after only three
issues. Mill wrote four long essays (for the complex bibliographic
details and Mill’s comments, see CW, Vol. I, pp. 121-3, 132, and 706),
but none on the Corn Laws. In the Review volume for the session of 1825
(London: Longman, et al., 1826), an article on the Corn Laws (pp.
690-705) is identified in George Grote’s copy (University of London
Library) as by Charles Austin (1799-1874), younger brother of John
Austin and a close friend to Mill. Another article, of which the
authorship is unknown, also entitled “Corn Laws,” is in the Review
volume for 1826 (London: Longman, et al., 1826), pp. 662-710.

1
Jean Paul Marat (1743-93), Jacobin leader, advocate of a strong
dictatorship, was murdered in his bath by Marie Anne Charlotte de Corday
(1768-93), an ardent republican, who was guillotined for the murder. The
Girondists, more moderate than Marat and Robespierre, lost the struggle
for control in the Assembly and consequently twenty-one of them were
guillotined on 31 Oct., 1793. Mill was greatly attracted by them; see,
e.g., CW, Vol. I, pp. 65-7, and Vol. XX, pp. 98-109.

2
The speech of 19 Nov. is in Moniteur, 1832, p. 1977. Louis Philippe’s
Dutch counterpart was William I (1772-1844), who assumed the title in
1814, and ruled until 1840.

5
The Décade Philosophique was founded in April 1794 as a moderate
republican paper, with articles on philosophy, science, literature, and
politics. Called Revue Philosophique after October 1804, it ran until
September 1807. The founders, with Say, were Sébastien Roch Nicolas
Chamfort (1741-94), Academician and ironist who, threatened with arrest,
shot himself, and Pierre Louis Ginguené (1748-1816), a brilliant scholar
and literary historian, imprisoned during the Terror, who made his
reputation with his L’histoire littéraire de l’Italie (1811).

Gibbons Merle (ca. 1796-1855) was Paris correspondent of the Globe and
Traveller from 1829 to his death. See his attacks in the Globe and
Traveller, 23 Oct., 1832, p. 3, and 29 Oct., p. 2, for example, and the
accompanying leading articles on French affairs of those dates, both on
p. 2.

Richard Lalor Sheil (1791-1851) started life as a dramatist. He
supported O’Connell in the 1820s and became an M.P. in 1830, supporting
repeal.

4
Edward George Geoffrey Smith Stanley (1799-1869), later 14th Earl of
Derby and Prime Minister, was elected as a Whig M.P. in 1822. At this
time he was a moderate supporter of reform in Grey’s cabinet.

“By the way, . . . [Le National] informs its readers that ‘it may now be
considered as almost certain that the repeal of the Union between
England and Ireland will be effected.’ Can you tell why, gentle
reader?—because Mr. Shiel, who had hitherto remained silent on the
subject, has declared himself, at Clonmel, to be in favour of it!!! What
a tit-bit for the Gallic gobe-mouches!” (Globe and Traveller, 25 Oct.,
1832, p. 2.)

7
Dom Pedro (1798-1834), Emperor of Brazil since 1822, succeeded to the
Portuguese throne as Pedro IV in 1826, but abdicated in favour of his
daughter Maria da Gloria, aged seven. His younger brother, the
absolutist Dom Miguel (1802-66), however, declared himself king in 1828.
In 1831 Pedro came from Brazil to fight for his daughter’s rights. The
liberals in England supported Pedro, who landed with troops, including
500 French and 300 British, at Oporto in July 1832. The siege was
lifted, and Pedro became Regent for his daughter, who had become Maria
II.

The Courier, founded as an opposition journal in 1792, after 1807 was
considered a mouthpiece for the Tory ministers, but when the Whigs came
to power in 1830 it quickly changed sides, often expressing Brougham’s
views.

13
From 1828 to 1832, the short-reigned editors of the Courier were Thomas
George Street (who had edited it also from 1811 to 1817), Eugenius
Roche, a Mr. McEntaggart, John Galt, and Gibbons Merle. The
proprietorship seems to have been a group of shareholders having control
from 1827; in 1830 the principal proprietor was William Stewart, who had
as partners the brothers George and John Rennie.

14
For the Journal des Débats, see No. 50, n4. The Constitutionnel, a
bourgeois and liberal newspaper, was founded during the early days of
the Restoration. After the July Revolution, it loudly supported the new
regime and declined markedly in quality and circulation.

For the background, see No. 185. Dupin received 234 votes out of a
possible 376; his only rival, Laffitte, received 136 (Moniteur, 22 Nov.,
1832, p. 1989).

2
Alphonse Marie Marcellus Thomas Bérenger (1785-1866), a magistrate,
chairman of the commission that investigated the administration of
Charles X, was an influential member of the constitutional opposition;
and Charles Guillaume Etienne (1777-1845), playwright and politician,
like Bérenger an Academician, had been Censor-General of Newspapers
under Napoleon.

3
Félix Réal (1792-1864), was Deputy for Isère, and avocat-général at
Grenoble.

The Commission was appointed on 23 Nov. (Moniteur, 1832, p. 1998).

The promises of the Speech from the Throne (19 Nov.; see No. 185)
resulted in Projet de loi relatif à l’instruction primaire (31 Dec.,
1832), ibid., 3 Jan., 1833, pp. 15-16 (enacted as Bull. 105, No. 236 [28
June, 1833], the “loi Guizot”); Proposition de loi sur la responsabilité
des ministres et des agents du pouvoir (12 Dec.), ibid., 1832, pp.
2139-40 (not enacted); Projet de loi sur l’organisation municipale (8
Dec.), ibid., pp. 2113-14; Projet de loi sur les attributions communales
(8 Dec.), ibid., pp. 2114-16 (the latter leading eventually to Bull.
521, No. 6946 [18 July, 1837]); Projet de loi sur le conseil-général et
les conseils d’arrondissement du département de la Seine, et sur la
municipalité de la ville de Paris (8 Dec.), ibid., pp. 2116-17; and
Projet de loi relatif à l’état de siège (10 Dec.), which was not enacted
(see No. 204).

Jean Baptiste Teste (1780-1852) was proscribed as a deputy during the
Hundred Days, but returned in 1830; he became a minister only in 1834.

For earlier comment, see No. 185. “Nouveaux détails sur l’attentat du 20
novembre,” Constitutionnel, 21 Nov., p. 2, identifies Adèle Boury (aged
nineteen) as the daughter of the postmaster of Bergues (Nord); her
“young man” was named Masse.

In 1831 Villiers became Secretary to the Board of Control, and had been
working on the important revision of the charter of the East India
Company that removed its trading monopoly in 1833.

Projet de loi sur les douanes, introduced 3 Dec., debated 4-5 Dec.
(Moniteur, 1832, pp. 2075-7 with the text on pp. 2084-5) would alter the
provisions of the Corn Law, Bull. 462, No. 10886 (4 July, 1821), and the
Customs Law, Bull. 91, No. 3076 (17 May, 1826).

Robert Henley Eden (1789-1841), 2nd Baron Henley, barrister, M.P.
1826-30 and Master in Chancery 1826-40, made the proposal for a
corporation (not a Parliamentary Commission) to be called “The
Commissioners for the Management of Ecclesiastical Property,” in A Plan
of Church Reform (London: Roake and Varty, 1832), pp. 32ff.

3
The reports were just coming in to the Poor Law Commission, and it seems
very likely that Mill got the information from Edwin Chadwick, Secretary
to the Commission and a close friend. The evidence was that of the
Reverend Thomas Whately at Cookham, eventually published in the report
of C.H. Cameron and John Wrottesley (24 Apr., 1833), in “Report from His
Majesty’s Commissioners for Inquiring into the Administration and
Practical Operation of the Poor Laws,” PP, 1834, XXVIII, 151-64.

Preached at the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, Nov. 9, 1662 (Oxford:
Robinson, 1663).

Since this was written, Lord Althorp, in an election speech, has
declared it to be his opinion that the Corn Laws ought not to be
reconsidered in the approaching Session.

We have much confidence in the goodness of Lord Althorp’s intentions;
but if this be a sample of the judgment, and power of appreciating his
position, with which those good intentions are to be carried into
effect, all our fears are more than verified. [The Times, 17 Dec., 1832,
p. 3, reported in brief Lord Althorp’s reply to a question about the
Corn Laws after he was declared elected (unopposed) for Northamptonshire
on 15 Dec.]

wax; and 2 & 3 William IV, c. 84 (1832), which provided much lower
duties on some items, removed some from the table, and provided for
reciprocity.

Duties were removed or lowered on a wide variety of imports by 22nd
Congress, Sess. 1, c. 227 (14 July, 1832).

He died on 28 Dec.

Antoine Pierre Joseph Marie Barnave (1761-93) played a prominent role in
the Constituent Assembly, of which he became President in October 1790.
When the Assembly dissolved in September 1791, he returned to Grenoble
where he was arrested, brought back to Paris, and guillotined on 30
Nov., 1793.

3
The greatest orator was Mirabeau.

4
Georges Jacques Danton (1759-94) belonged to the Committee of Public
Safety, sharing responsibility for the September massacres; he lost the
power struggle with Robespierre, and was guillotined on 5 Apr., 1794.
The mot, said to have originated with Vergniaud, was perhaps taken by
Mill from Joachim Vilate, Causes secrètes de la journée du 9 au 10
thermidor, in Le vieux cordelier, par Camille Desmoulins; Causes
secrètes . . . , par Vilate . . . (Paris and Brussells: Baudoin, 1825),
p. 192: “La révolution, comme Saturne, eut bientôt dévoré ses plus
tendres enfans.” Vilate, however, does not attribute the phrase, but
applies it to Desmoulins and Danton.

5
In a speech on 10 Mar., Lameth had nominated Barnave for inclusion in
the projected Panthéon (Moniteur, 1832, p. 712).

6
Bertrand de Barère de Vieuzac (1755-1841), one of the most extreme
members of the National Convention and a member of the Committee of
Public Safety, first supported Robespierre and then drafted the report
denouncing him. He served Bonaparte, and went into exile under the
Restoration, returning in 1830.

*
Unless, of which we are not certain, Prieur de la Marne still survives.
We forget whether the ex-director and eminent lawyer, Merlin de Douai,
was a member of the Constituent Assembly. [Pierre Louis Prieur de la
Marne (1756-1827), a lawyer, member of the Committee of Public Safety
and President of the Convention, known for his bitter attacks on the
ancien régime, was banished as a regicide in 1816 and had died in
Brussels in 1827. Merlin de Douai, who was still alive, had been a
member of the Constituent Assembly.]

7
Charles Carroll (1737-1832), owner of Carrollton Manor in Maryland, was
a delegate to the Maryland Convention of 1776, which declared for
separation from England, a delegate to the Continental Congress, and a
signer of the Declaration of Independence. He always signed his name
Carroll of Carrollton.

measure proposed in “The Petition of the Nobility, Gentry, and Others of
the County of Norfolk,” Cobbett’s Weekly Register, XLV (11 Jan., 1823),

So far as the tax affected private creditors, it would fall not upon
them, but upon their debtors; for the rate of interest would probably
rise in proportion to the tax. If it did not, the mortgagees and all
other creditors would instantly call in their debts, and either buy land
or stock at the reduced prices, or become sleeping partners in some
commercial or manufacturing establishment, by which process they would
escape from this notable species of taxation.

The bill was introduced on 12 Dec. (Moniteur, 1832, pp. 2137-8); it was
reintroduced on 29 Apr. (ibid., 1833, p. 1200), and was enacted as Bull.
107, No. 241 (7 July, 1833).

4
The bill, which had first been introduced on 15 Sept., 1831, was lost in
the session suspended because of the cholera epidemic. Resubmitted in
revised form on 8 Dec., 1832, it was reported back on 5 Jan. (Moniteur,
1833, pp. 42-4). Its progress continued in the next session and it was
enacted as Bull. 104, No. 235 (22 June, 1833).

A new Art. 9 resulted from an amendment on 16 Jan. (Moniteur, 1833, p.
126).

It began the very day after the prorogation of the first session, on 26
Apr., and continued until 26 June.

11
Mill’s prediction was fulfilled; when the budget (Bull. 106, Nos. 239
and 240) was approved, the session was prorogued.

12
Salverte’s proposal (see No. 132) had finally been adopted by the
Chamber of Deputies on 31 Dec., 1832, as Règlement relatif à la reprise
des travaux législatifs interrompus par la clôture des sessions
(Moniteur, 1833, p. 6).

13
For earlier discussion, see Nos. 126 and 187, n6. The bill, after being
promised in the Throne speech on 19 Nov., 1832, had been introduced on
31 Dec. (Moniteur, 1833, pp. 15-16); the repeated delays account for
Mill’s frustrated tone.

14
The Projet de loi relatif à l’état de siège of 10 Dec. (ibid., 1832, pp.
2118-19) was sent back to the commission (i.e., rejected) on 18 Feb.
(ibid., 1833, pp. 425-30).

15
The issue of La Tribune for 14 Mar. had been seized “comme excitant à la
haine et au mépris du Gouvernement” (Moniteur, 1833, p. 703); in La
Tribune of 2 Apr., p. 1, Lionne had written: “O le bon billet de La
Châtre que nous donne là cette Chambre prostituée!” He was sentenced to
three years in prison and 10,000 francs fine (Moniteur, 17 Apr., 1833,
p. 1080).

The Duchess had finally been arrested. While she was in prison, the
revelation that she was pregnant had caused a scandal, fanned by the
Government. A daughter, Anne Marie Rosalie Lucchesi-Palli, was born on
10 May (she lived only until 8 Nov.). In June, the Duchess was released
to return to Italy and to Hector (Ettore) de Lucchesi-Palli (1806-64), a
Sicilian nobleman, who had served in the Neapolitan diplomatic service,
to whom she had claimed to have been secretly married.

The scheme’s main provisions, apart from the geographical limitation on
joint-stock banks, were to allow new joint-stock banks only by charter,
to make Bank of England notes legal tender and induce country banks to
use them, to require the Bank to publicize quarterly the amount of
bullion and number of notes in circulation, and to exempt the Bank from
the 5% interest limit, in respect of bills of less than three months.

It is characteristic of the little attention paid to these subjects by
all except those who are privately interested in them, that all the
periodical publications of any importance, with one exception, have
either taken part with the monopoly or been silent. The exception to
which we allude is Tait’s Magazine, which has furnished the only
refutation we have yet seen in print of the arguments for the exclusive
privilege of the Bank. That work, which ranks high in so many other
respects for ability and right principles, stands quite alone among the
periodical works of the day in the general soundness and depth of its
Political Economy. [“Ministers and the Bank Charter,” by William Tait
(1793-1864), the proprietor and editor, appeared in Tait’s Edinburgh
Magazine, II (Mar. 1833), 753-4. Mill’s own contributions to Tait’s
included “The Currency Juggle,” II (Jan. 1833), 461-7 (CW, Vol. IV, pp.
181-92), which concludes with an editorial reference to “free trade in
banking” as exposited in the series by Henry Brooke Parnell (see No.
217, n12), “The Bank Charter,” Tait’s, I (June 1832), 291-314; (July),

Mill’s note (in square brackets) was appended to this paragraph: “ ‘The
Benefactors of Mankind Usually Unpopular during Their Lives’—In scarcely
an instance did any great improvement, intellectual, moral, or
political, originate with men who stood well with the world during their
lives and labours; who were courted, rewarded, honoured, and patronized
by the great, and regarded as benefactors by the multitude whom those
great ones ruled, and who ended their thriving lives in circumstances of
peace and affluence. Our Miltons kept school for bread and cheese. Our
Marvels dined on the pickings of cold mutton bones. Our Sidneys perished
on the scaffold. The power which theyopposed consents to join in
praising their memories, when it thinks they can no longer do it any
harm. So it was in Judea. Build and garnish the sepulchres of the
prophets of a past generation.—Fox’s Monthly Repository.” (Anon.,

On 17 Jan., 1832, Michael Sadler had introduced “A Bill to Regulate the
Labour of Children and Young Persons in the Mills and Factories of the
United Kingdom” (2 William IV, PP, 1831-32, II, 1-10), restricting all
those under eighteen years of age to ten hours a day or less—a
restriction that it was hoped would in practice apply to all workers. On
Sadler’s defeat at the election, Lord Ashley reintroduced a slightly
strengthened version with the same title on 5 Mar., 1833 (3 William IV,
PP, 1833, II, 263-80). The information gathered, first by the Select
Committee and then by the Royal Commission prompted by these bills,
forced the Home Secretary, Lord Althorp, to steer through the House a
Government measure, again with the same title (4 William IV [1 Aug.,
1833], ibid., II, 281-95), which was enacted as 3 & 4 William IV, c. 103
(1833). This measure, while it restricted the hours of those under
thirteen to nine per day, did not include the ten-hour provision, which
was not secured until 10 Victoria, c. 29 (1847).

339-416, the provision was in Clause 142; in the second version (22
Apr.; ibid., pp. 417-98), the Clause had become No. 147; after
vociferous opposition to the proposal, the Bill as amended by Committee
(25 June; ibid., pp. 499-586), which was enacted as 3 & 4 William IV, c.
37, did not include the provision.

The fifth in precedence of the great officers of state (coming before
the dukes), his custodianship of the privy seal was virtually formal in
Mill’s time, though it originally, in the reign of Edward III, was seen
as a check on the royal power.

*
Be it well understood that we are not giving credit to the men who ruled
the councils of the five powers, for having the slightest foresight of
these ultimate results, or being actuated by any other motives than
those of immediate convenience. They are unconscious, and if they were
conscious, would probably be unwilling agents, in a work which is
greater than they know. The Holy Alliance was a mere vulgar union of the
strong for keeping down the weak. Now the weak have also become strong
and the hostile interests being nearly balanced, have been brought to a
compromise. No otherwise than thus were law and order substituted for
chaos in any individual community. The strong never would yield
submission to a superior authority while their strength would serve
them; but when the weak by combination became in their turn formidable
to the strong, the latter reluctantly consented to the acknowledgement
of a common superior. [In response to the revolt of Belgium from the
Netherlands in August 1830, Britain, France, Austria, Prussia, and
Russia met in the London Conference of November 1830. (For background,
see No. 59, n5.) They ordered cessation of hostilities on 20 Jan., 1831,
but following the powers’ recognition of the Belgians’ election of
Leopold as king in June, the Dutch invaded in August. The French forced
the Dutch to retreat, and a treaty was arranged by the London Conference
on 15 Nov., 1831.]

On 11 Dec., 1833, François Vincent Raspail (for his earlier trial,see
No. 137) and twenty-six young men, members of the Société des Droits de
l’Homme, were brought before the Cour d’Assises de la Seine on charges
of conspiracy. Each session was reported in the Moniteur, the opening
one on pp. 2436-8, and the closing one pp. 2484-6. The Société des
Droits de l’Homme was a regrouping of the Société des Amis du Peuple,
which had been broken up at the end of 1832. The new society, modelled
on Robespierre’s Société des Jacobins, was secret, republican, and
carefully organized into cells covering nearly all areas of France, and
was especially strong in Paris and Lyons. Its newspaper was La Tribune
until it was banned, and then the Réformateur.

In his concluding speech on 21 Dec. (Moniteur, 1833, p. 2481), Emile
Delapalme (1793-1868), the avocat-général, did not admit there was

Guillard de Kersausie (1798-1874), another liberal activist and former
Carbonaro. The admission had come earlier; see the account of the trial

was Thomas Robert Bugeaud de la Piconnerie, duc d’Isly (1784-1849), who
became a general under Louis Philippe, and had been a deputy since 1831.
The Société des Droits de l’Homme (see No. 226, n2) had issued in 1833
the Déclaration des droits de l’homme et du citoyen, prefaced to the
Constitution of 1793 by Robespierre; see No. 233 for Mill’s fuller
discussion.

The notice in the Examiner, 12 Jan., p. 21, under “Foreign Intelligence.

be by Mill. In the debate on 7 Jan. (Moniteur, 1834, pp. 53-4), Broglie,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, expressed his approval of the speech just
given by Bignon, in which the latter argued that peace must never be
bought—with the implication that it had—at the sacrifice of France’s
interests in allowing any one of the great powers of Europe to set aside
treaties and to upset the status quo in Poland, in Turkey, or in Italy.
On the next day, Broglie explained that he shared only Bignon’s
principle, not his interpretation of recent events (ibid., pp. 59-60).

At the time of Mill’s earlier reports of the incidents (Nos. 185 and

however, two young men were charged, and she appeared only as a witness
in their trial (reported in Le National, 14 Mar., 1833, pp. 2-4). In the
same issue (p. 2) a leading article criticized the president of the Cour
Royale, Jean Jacques Duboys (1768-1845), professor of law, former
procureur-général of Angers and a deputy since 1830, and the two

Gregorio Fontana-Rava has left little trace. It is known that he ran a
bookshop in Antwerp which became a centre for Italian patriots and that
after he came to England in May 1833 he lectured twice a week in the
Burton Lecture Rooms on advanced topics. Gioacchino Prati (1790-1863)
was a romantic Italian patriot and revolutionary of high birth. He
travelled throughout Italy and (after his exile in 1821) Europe,
founding secret societies and furthering revolutionary causes. In 1823
he came to England where, he says, through Bowring he wrote for the
Westminster Review. He became a Saint-Simonian in 1803-31 and in 1837
was editor of the Penny Satirist, in which he published his
autobiography (1837-39), reprinted in Annuario dell’istituto storico
italiano per l’età moderna e contemporanea, Vols. XVII-XVIII (1965-66)
and XIX-XX (1967-68).

Mohammed (or Mehemet) Ali (1769-1849), the ex-Albanian soldier who had
cooperated with the British in expelling the French, by 1811 had command
of Egypt. He began investigating the feasibility of a Suez Canal, on
which Enfantin advised. Enfantin was accompanied to Egypt by about five
disciples, including Marie Jérôme Henri Fournel (1799-1876), a mining
engineer; they were preceded by another larger group of former
Saint-Simonians, including, as well as Barrault and Rodrigues, Félicien
David (1810-76), composer, and Charles Joseph Lambert (1804-64), yet
another engineer.

The Revue Encyclopédique included articles by such former
Saint-Simonians as Pierre Leroux (1798-1871), its director, and Jean

François Charles Dulong (1792-1834), lawyer and politician of the left.
On 25 Jan., during a very heated discussion over the rights of young
officers, especially those in the artillery, Dulong shouted a remark at
General Bugeaud, referring to him as the gaoler of the duchesse de
Berry. (The debate but not the interjection appears in Moniteur, 1834,
pp. 162-4.) A duel took place on 29 Jan. in which Dulong was wounded; he
died next day and was buried on 1 Feb.

Prati presumably reproduced in his letter Enfantin’s letter to Hoart,
Bruneau, Rogé, and Massol (which Mill of course had not seen). The
latter may be found in Oeuvres de Saint-Simon et d’Enfantin, Vol. IX,
pp. 99-108. The end of the passage (presumably in Prati’s English)
renders the original’s “Revenons à notre place” (p. 103).

Diocletian (245-313), Emperor of Rome 284-305, abdicated in 305 and
retired to Salona, but did not resume power. Mill may be thinking of
Maximianus I (ca. 240-310), who had shared power with Diocletian, and
abdicated with him. Persuaded to resume power in 306, he had to abdicate
again in 307. In 308, he became Emperor for a third time, chosen by the
soldiers; later the same year, he was once more removed, and in 310 he
committed suicide.

Nero (37-68), renowned for his profligacy, used murder and massacre to
maintain his power; Charles IX of France (1550-74), was duc d’Orléans
until, at the age of ten, he succeeded his brother, François II. The
religious strife and secret plotting that distinguished his reign
culminated in the St. Bartholomew’s Day massacre.

*
This expression, we observe, has found favour in the eyes of English
Tories, who, thinking it must mean something disgraceful, employ it ad
invidiam, little knowing who were its authors, and neither knowing nor
caring in what sense it was intended to be understood. The phrase was
invented to characterize the conduct during the Restoration, of those
Liberals who, disapproving of the existing Government, and not being
permitted to speak or write anything which might bring it into
discredit, adopted the only course which seemed left to them for
effecting its subversion, by allying themselves with those who made
their stand upon the Charter; and contended for the strict observance of
the Constitution, not so much for its own sake, as because they in
reality believed that its strict observance was incompatible with the
Bourbon dynasty, who could only maintain themselves against the growing
strength of public odium by perpetual violations of the Charter, and if
precluded from these must certainly fall. [The phrase was first used in
“Séance d’avant-hier à la cour des pairs,” Le Globe, 24 Nov., 1830, p.
1, and its popularity discussed in “La comédie de quinze ans,” ibid., 22
Apr., 1831, p. 1.]

Albin Reine, baron Roussin (1781-1854), began his naval career under

François Barbé de Marbois (1745-1837) had been President of the Cour des
Comptes since 1808. Ill in 1833, he had tendered his resignation, and
failed to withdraw it when, on recovery, he returned to his post, thus
making it easier for Louis Philippe to remove him.

Martin Michel Charles Gaudin, duc de Gaète (1756-1841), a member of the
Treasury before the Revolution of 1789, had become Minister of Finance

There had been trouble in Lyons from the middle of February. One of the
republican societies that sent emissaries was the Société des Droits de
l’Homme. It was thought by many at the time, and certainly by the French
Government, that the uprisings in Paris and Lyons were part of a
conspiracy to provide some diversionary incidents, requested by Mazzini,
during his (unsuccessful) attempt, begun in February, to liberate Savoy
and Piedmont.

2
From 21 to 23 Feb., there were demonstrations against the law limiting
crieurs publics in various locations in Paris (for details, see No. 236,
n4), but particularly at the Place de la Bourse, where the crieurs
publics were accustomed to sell radical newspapers and pamphlets
(“Tribunal de première instance de la Seine,” Constitutionnel, 15 Apr.,

Though Mill evidently had not seen the reports, on 15 Apr. three bills
were introduced: Projet de loi relatif aux détenteurs d’armes et de
munitions de guerre, Projet de loi relatif à un crédit extraordinaire
sur l’exercice 1834, and Projet de loi pour un crédit additionnel au
budget du ministère de guerre pour 1835, all of which were enacted on 24
May, as Bull. 125, Nos. 277-9. (For the bills, see Moniteur, 1834, pp.

The limitation to the “higher class” of crimes is found in Loi
concernant la police de sûreté, la justice criminelle, et
l’établissement des jurés (29 Sept., 1791), Lois et actes du
gouvernement, IV, 253 (Art. 5); the limitation to political offences, in

(Lebon, Mathé, and Lemonnier) received three years; one (Vignerte)
received two years; one (Defraize) received six months; five (Ephraïm,
Ferard, Allard, Sarge, and Labruyère) received two months; twelve others

The editor (1817-41) was Thomas Barnes (1785-1841).

The “greater master in blackguardism” was William Maginn (1793-1842),
Irish journalist and poet, who, in the Morning Herald, 17 Feb., 1829,
fixed the epithet “Thunderer” on The Times (after it had said, “we
thundered out that article,” on 11 Feb., 1829).

The quotation is from a leading article on the Poor Laws, The Times, 8
May, p. 5. Despite the disclaimer of the last sentence, on 13 May, in a
scathing attack, The Times attributed the leader to Mill’s friend Edwin
Chadwick, who had taken an active part in the inquiries of the Poor Law
Commission and who was thought to be a candidate for the Central Board.

On 9 May, the second reading of the Bill (see No. 252) passed the
Commons with a majority of 299 (319 to 20) (PD, 3rd ser., Vol. 23, col.

Journal des Débats, 31 Oct., pp. 2-3; 21 Dec., pp. 2-3; and 26 Dec.,
1833, p. 3, by “Cs.,” i.e., Philarète E. Chasles (spelled Chales by
Mill) (1798-1873), journalist, librarian, and later professor at the
Collège de France, labelled by Mill in private letters a humbug (EL, CW,
Vol. XII, pp. 343, 346). He was reviewing England and the English, 2
vols. (London: Bentley, 1833), by Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer
(1803-73), novelist and statesman, and an associate of Mill’s at the
time. Bulwer’s book contained material by J.S. Mill on Bentham (see CW,
Vol. X, pp. 3-18 and 499-502) and James Mill (see CW, Vol. I, pp.
589-95).

Chasles, 21 Dec., p. 3. The references are to Bulwer’s novels: Paul
Clifford, 3 vols. (London: Colburn and Bentley, 1830), Pelham, 3 vols.
(London: Colburn, 1828), and Devereux, 3 vols. (London: Colburn, 1829).

Principles of Political Economy (Edinburgh: Tait, 1825), p. 14, and his
Discourse on Political Economy (Edinburgh: Constable, 1824), p. 10.

England and the English, Vol. II, pp. 36-40. Louis François Bertin de
Vaux (1771-1842), a peer since 1832, is (not surprisingly, since they
shared the same names) mistakenly confused with his brother, Louis
François Bertin, called l’aîné (1766-1841), proprietor and editor of the
Journal des Débats.

Heinrich Friedrich Karl, Baron von Stein (1757-1831), and Prince Karl
August von Hardenberg (1750-1822), leading Prussian statesmen, who
instigated a wide variety of reforms. Stein, for instance, abolished
villeinage and all distinctions in land tenure and occupations (No. 16
[9 Oct., 1807] in Sammlung der für die Königlichen Preussischen Staaten
erschienenen Gesetze und Verordnungen von 1806 bis zum 27sten Oktober
1810, pp. 170-2), converted hereditary leaseholders into proprietors
(No. 41 [27 July, 1808], ibid., pp. 245-50), and reformed the magistracy
in towns and villages (No. 57 [19 Nov., 1808], ibid., pp. 324-60).
Hardenberg also reformed the land laws, standardized taxation, and moved
towards free trade (No. 2 [27 Oct., 1810], in Gesetz-Sammlung für die
Königlichen Preussischen Staaten, 1810, pp. 24-31; No. 3 [28 Oct.],
ibid., pp. 33-9; No. 4 [28 Oct.], ibid,, pp. 40-76; No. 482 [26 May,

pp. 72-80), and, in instituting three-year military service, made
advancement depend on merit (No. 245 [3 Sept., 1814], ibid., 1814, pp.
79-82).

Why men? The logical opposite of children is grown persons. From an
imperfection in our language (not found in the French) there is often
almost a necessity for using the masculine pronoun where both sexes are
equally concerned, but seldom the masculine substantive. The effect upon
the mind of this phraseology is bad; it encourages the habit of passing
by one-half of the race as not concerned in its highest interests, and
we should have been pleased if a woman had avoided sanctioning the
practice by her example.

he and Hercule Gilbert Marie Guillemot, the managing editor of the
Messager, were tried before the Cour d’Assises de la Seine on 10 May,
and found guilty (National de 1834, 11 May, p. 4). The news seems not to
have reached Mill that, on appeal, while Gervais was condemned to two
months’ imprisonment and a fine of 500 francs, Guillemot was acquitted
(ibid., 11 June, pp. 2-4, 12 June, pp. 3-4, 13 June, pp. 2-4; Moniteur,

The states of the North American Union in which slavery is forbidden are
only parts of a society, whose slaves amount to 2,000,000, and are

to counteract the evils of superabundance of land in the
non-slave-holding states is explained at length in [Wakefield’s] England

The Poor Law Amendment Bill had been read in the Commons a third time,
and passed with a majority of 137, on 1 July, 1834 (PD, 3rd ser., Vol.

In the event, the three Commissioners appointed to put the new law into
execution were Thomas Frankland Lewis (1780-1855), M.P. for various
constituencies from 1812 to 1834, when he resigned to take on the
Chairmanship of the Commission (1834-39); John George Shaw-Lefevre
(1797-1879), barrister, recently Under-Secretary in the Colonial Office;
and George Nicholls (1781-1865), sailor, collaborator with Telford on
canal building, and then banker, former overseer of the poor in
Southwell and writer on poor relief who proposed the “workhouse test,”
refusing relief out-of-doors except as a last resort. Edwin Chadwick
(1800-90), social reformer, disciple of Bentham, lifelong friend of J.S.
Mill, was appointed as first Secretary of the Board.

determine his true origins. Garnier argues that he was the eldest son of
Carl, Grosherzog von Baden (1786-1818) and his wife, Stephanie Napoleon.

to enable labourers to set up on their own in a few years, and high
enough to ensure that those few years would be needed.
