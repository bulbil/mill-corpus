Dear Mr Godwin—

It gave me great pleasure to hear from you & especially to receive a
letter shewing so fundamental an agreement in our mode of thinking on
the great questions of the future. The emancipation of women, &
cooperative production, are, I fully believe, the two great changes that
will regenerate society. But though the latter of these may grow up
without much help from the action of Parliaments & Congresses, the
former cannot. I have always thought with you that the abstinence of
many of the best minds in America from political life was to a great
degree accounted for by the fact that America, as a rule, needs very
little governing. But the present is surely a time in which, even in
America, the action of legislation & administration is of transcendant
importance; & in the old & complicated societies of Europe the need of
political action is always, more or less, what exceptional circumstances
make it in America at present. Moreover, a place in Parliament is, in
England, a vantage ground from which opinions can be promulgated to a
larger audience & with a far greater probability of being listened to,
than from any other position except perhaps that of the editor of a
widely circulated daily paper. It was with this hope principally that I
accepted a seat in Parliament, & on the one subject at least, the
political enfranchisement of women, the results have far exceeded my
expectation. It is doubtful whether there remains anything of the first
importance which I could more effectually help forward by being in
Parlt. Personal representation, the greatest political improvement after
women’s suffrage which remains to be made, I can help, perhaps as
effectively, by my writings. I am therefore quite content on public
grounds to be no longer a member of the House, while on private my
release justifies and more than justifies, your congratulations.

If you are in England in March or April I shall hope to see you & to
compare notes with you on many subjects both American & general.

TO HENRY MAINE1

Jan. 1. 1869

My dear Sir—

The painfully interesting papers2 which you kindly forwarded to me have
impressed me with a very strong sense of the degree in which official
opinion has retrograded in India since I ceased to be a regular reader
of Indian official correspondence.3 When I left the India House the
feeling that the actual cultivators had claims upon us which we could
not ignore was leading to plans for revising in their favour, so far as
was still possible even the system established by Lord Cornwallis in
Bengal proper;4 Act 10 of 1859,5 with the provisions of which I am very
imperfectly acquainted, was, I believe the fruit of this movement. Now,
however, there seems to be a reaction towards landlordism of the present
English type, at the very time when in England opinion is, though
slowly, beginning to turn the contrary way. And, what is most of all
deplorable, this reaction seems to be chiefly among the younger men. I
do not maintain that the evil is to be ascribed to the constitutional
change made in 1858,6 for it is very probable that the mutiny & its
consequences would have wrought the same change for the worse if the old
organ of government had continued. The greater fear of the natives, &
desire of conciliating the natives, which have existed since the mutiny
(“the natives” being as usual a mere synonym for the powerful classes,
the great landholders) have discredited the ideas of protection to the
interests of the great mass of the population which in a more or less
enlightened shape had been the animating principle of Indian government
for a whole generation. The Talockdars of Oude, the very men whose
atrocities were the defence Edition: current; Page: [1537] pleaded for
the annexation of the country,7 have been made by us greater men than
they ever were; & now everybody, even though a peasant, on whom it is
possible to fasten the name of a proprietor is in the opinion of an
apparently powerful party, to be treated as if the land & its
inhabitants only existed for his benefit. These notions, which I am
afraid are ruling the local administration of the Central Provinces as
well as the Punjab, naturally find warm support from the ignorant,
arriéré, prejudiced & bigotted Toryism of Sir W. Mansfield.8 Until now
the strong contrary convictions of Sir John Lawrence9 have moderated the
mischief, but India has now got an Irish landlord to rule over her:10 &
it is quite uncertain whether his official superior the Duke of Argyll
will be any check upon his landlordism.11 There has been no more
determined defender than the Duke, of the evictions, in utter defiance
of customary & traditional ideas of rights, which have depopulated the
North of Scotland.

To look at the matter on another side: is it not monstrous that young
settlement officers12 should have had it in their power, without express
authorisation or instructions from the Government to reduce to the
condition of mere tenants at will in a single district 46000 out of
60000 cultivators who had been declared at the former settlement to have
rights of occupancy?13 & that too when they had been so declared on the
ground, equitable Edition: current; Page: [1538] enough under the
circumstances, of continuous occupation for a minimum period of 12
years, which 10 or 15 years additional occupancy under our rule had
increased to a quarter of a century. All this disturbance of recognised
rights and authorised expectations, so great an evil anywhere & one of
the greatest in India, is incurred for the sake of a retrograde step in
economics & social organisation! I hope I am not wrong in collecting
from the discussion in Council that these divisions of the Settlement
officers will not be upheld unless when they would have been valid
divisions under the Act just passed.14 A great part of these however
would have been valid under the Act, especially in the case of tenants
who have at any time made an admission of their having no rights of
occupancy, which I perceive they did in 19000 out of the 46000 cases, &
I agree with you in profoundly distrusting these admissions; not only
for the very sufficient reasons stated by you in Council, nor only from
the great probability that the admissions were often obtained by unfair
means, but also from the little value which the natives of India
habitually attach to admissions against their own interest, because they
have not been accustomed to expect that they will be held bound by them.

Except the exclusion of so large a number of cases from its benefits, I
do not see much to complain of in the terms of the compromise
established by the new Act. The distinction between Khoodkaust ryots &
Pyekaust ryots15 is familiar to all administrators of Northern India,
the former being understood to have an inherited right of occupancy of
ancient date, while the latter belong to families who have arrived at a
comparatively late period & remained on tolerance; though I am not sure
that the Pyekaust ryots are always strictly tenants at will. Supposing
then that all are allowed rights of occupancy who have a just claim to
them, then, when there is no evidence of a right to hold at a fixed
rent, it seems as much as they could expect that their rent should be
fixed by law at 15 per cent less (your letter by a lapsus calami16 says
15 per cent more) than the rent paid by tenants who have no right of
occupancy. It is however a defect that while there is a power given to
the proprietor to buy out, on certain terms of compensation the rights
of the tenant, the Act gives no power to the tenant to buy out the
rights of the landlord. As was well said in the discussion, this is as
if the English Copyhold Commission,17 instead of enabling the copyholder
to redeem the legal Edition: current; Page: [1539] claim of the lord of
the manor, had empowered the lord to turn out the copyholder for a
compensation. This omission in the Act admits of being corrected by
subsequent legislation. But unless it is done this year you will not be
there to do it, & who can tell how your place may be filled?

It has given me great pleasure that your health does not seem to have
suffered from your residence in India. You will find abundant work for
one like you in England, much of it such as few have anything like your
qualifications for performing. I hope that such personal acquaintance
with you as I have ever had the good fortune of enjoying18 will be not
only renewed but greatly improved after your return to Europe.

Dear Mr McLaren—

I need hardly say that I am very much gratified by your kind letter. I
know that you & Mrs McLaren acted for the best & I agree with you that
the publication of my letter to her may do some good.2 As a rule however
I prefer that my letters should not be made public unless they were
written with a view to the contingency of their being so, & I have seen
with regret several recent instances in which publicity has been given
to them without my consent:3 not that I shrink from exposure to
criticism, which any public man, even any writer, ought to welcome, from
however hostile a quarter; but because, when writing confidentially to
friends who feel as one does oneself, one takes many things for granted
which would require explanation to general readers, & one does not guard
one’s expressions as prudence & courtesy would require one to do in
addressing oneself to those who differ from one. All the letters of mine
which have lately been published have been treated by the newspapers
exactly as if they had been written for the public & sent to the editors
by myself.

It is, as a general rule, best, I think, to ask the writer’s consent
before Edition: current; Page: [1540] publishing a letter. This is so
flattering a thing to do that there can never be any difficulty in doing
it.

I am particularly pleased at your approbation of the last sentence of my
letter4 because I can share in it myself, for it was dictated to me as I
wrote it word for word by my dear daughter. We always agree in
sentiments but she sometimes can find better words to put them in than I
can myself.

Dear Sir

I beg to acknowledge your letter of Nov. 7. I did not before know to
whom I was indebted for the copies of the World. I could perceive that
they were sent on account of the reports of the proceedings of the
Labour Congress,2 and I availed myself of them to look through those
reports, which are doubly interesting to me, by the indications they
afford of what is going on in the minds of Americans and in those of the
working men. In regard to the other matters touched on in your letter, I
am very glad to have your assurance that the payment of the debt in
greenbacks is not supported by the Democratic party.3 It is satisfactory
at all events, to know that so influential a democratic journal as the
World is opposed to it. On the subject of free trade, I have always
counted on finding the Democratic party the sounder of the two: and when
the question of reconstruction is settled (which, to my thinking, it can
never be on the principles of the Democratic party) I look forward to a
rearrangement of parties, in which free trade will come into the first
rank, and in which representation of minorities may also become
prominent: and I may then perhaps be more in sympathy with the
Democratic party, and less with those who oppose it, than I now am. Even
now I have friends and correspondents among the Democratic party, and I
am as desirous to do full justice to that party as I am to all parties
in my own country. Neither do I see that any injustice was done them in
my published letter.4 If they allow their elected Edition: current;
Page: [1541] Convention to profess, for electioneering purposes,
doctrines which are not theirs, a stranger is not in fault if, until
those doctrines are disavowed, he concludes them to be the doctrines of

being in the programme.

Dear Sir

I am much obliged to you for sending me the Tribunes.2 I need hardly say
that your letters are most gratifying to myself personally, & that I
have read with great interest the picture of the elections as they
presented themselves to your mind. In regard to the Westr election I
think your first impression of the cause of my defeat was more correct
than your subsequent one.3 I may have lost a good many votes by the
Bradlaugh business, but not so many as to account for the great
difference between Smith’s number at the poll & mine.

On one point I ought to correct your impression. You say it is reported
that I spent a great deal of money, some £1100, on my first election &
was expected to spend as much more on the second. I was not aware that
such things had been said or thought by any one. It is a literal fact
that neither of my contests has cost me one penny directly or
indirectly. You are right in thinking that I both could and would have
paid the expenses had I thought it desirable on public grounds to do so;
but having said that I would not I thought it right to adhere to my
word, for nothing does more mischief than Edition: current; Page: [1542]
high-flown professions which are only intended to be taken cum grano
salis by the initiated.

Republican opinions certainly seem to have a much greater number of
partisans in Spain than was supposed,4 & the number is likely to
increase as the prospect becomes more familiar to people’s minds in the
absence of any generally acceptable candidate for the throne.5 But it
strikes me that it would be a great mistake on the part of the
Republicans to include a President in their programme. They should have
a mere Prime Minister, removable by the Cortes. Even in America the
inconvenience is very great of having a President & a Congress who if
hostile to one another, cannot either of them get rid of the other for
what may be several years: & in any Continental European country the
almost certain consequence of discord between the two authorities would
be a coup d’état by the one which has troops under its command. There is
nothing in Prim’s6 career which gives me the smallest confidence in his
being, that rarity among Spanish politicians, a man of principle; & if
he becomes President of a Spanish Republic it will be very likely with
the full intention to take the first opportunity of playing the game of
Napoleon the Third,7 after which Spain will be a Republic after the
fashion of those of Spanish America,—a perpetual succession of military
dictators each supplanting his predecessor by a pronunciamento or a
civil war. That at least is my impression, grounded no doubt on very
imperfect knowledge.

Dear Mr Lyulph Stanley

When, during your assiduous attendance at the election proceedings in
Westminster, you spoke to me on the subject of an Association to claim
for the working class electors the right to an equal voice in the
selection of Edition: current; Page: [1543] Liberal candidates,2 I asked
for time for consideration before I could give a positive opinion as to
the present expediency of such an Association. The result of such
consideration is, that I think the time is come for such a movement. The
defeat of the working classes in the elections, and the subordinate
position which has consequently been assigned to the men of advanced
opinions in the formation of the government,3 have been so much noticed
and commented on by friends and enemies, that neither the working
classes themselves, nor their political allies, would be open to any
fair accusation of causing dissension by acting upon a fact so
universally recognised; but would rather be in danger of being supposed
to acquiesce in it as right and necessary, if they did not make some
demonstration against it. When I happen to be in correspondence with any
organs of the working classes on political matters, I now make a point
of inculcating on them the justice and expediency of standing out for
the choice of one of the Liberal candidates when there are two seats,
and for their claim to be consulted when there is only one.4 And I
should be happy at once to join the Association proposed by you and your
friends, whenever you are disposed to go on with the project. Only I
should not like to be (as you proposed) President of the Society, in as
much as, many of my personal friends being likely to be among its most
active members, it would be supposed that it [had] been set going by me
in order that by its means I might be reelected to Parliament; which
would not be a desirable impression to give, either for the Society or

subscribed to oblige Mr Kyllmann, who had failed to obtain help in other

I must beg you to excuse my delay in answering your letter, which has

Edition: current; Page: [1545] before doing so to consider well all the
topics which it would be possible for me to take up, and the points of
view from which they could be treated.3 I quite feel the force of your
remark that to put forth opinions which at first startle people often
stimulates & prepares their minds better than anything else that can be
done. This is the principle I myself act upon, and [several illegible
words] I think with some success last year in my proposals on the land
question in Ireland,4 which while they were almost universally decried
as violent & extreme have had the effect of making other proposals, up
to that time considered extreme, be considered comparatively moderate &
practicable.

Still it so happens that at the present juncture I can see no topic on
which the public mind is sufficiently prepared to welcome anything I
might have to say on which it is not already so far convinced that what
I could say would be of little practical use; and it is not on such an
occasion as this that one would like to put oneself in a position of
antagonism to one’s listeners, and insist on enforcing what one cannot
but feel to be unwelcome even if one is convinced that they are salutary
truths.

Your great kindness, and that of the other gentlemen who have the
management of the P.S. in being willing to put off if necessary their
annual festivals till a later date than usual to suit my convenience
makes me doubly reluctant to decline your kind invitation, and I hope
that you and they will not ascribe it to a want of appreciation of so

Dear Sir—

The reason why I think that a miracle could not prove supernatural power
to any one who did not already believe in the existence of Edition:
current; Page: [1546] some such power,2 is this, that we never can know
that any seeming miracle implies supernatural power. The achievement of
apparently impossible results by strictly natural means is a fact not
only within experience but within common experience. It is not even
necessary to suppose the employment of a law of nature not previously
discovered. It is sufficient to bear in mind the innumerable & truly
wonderful exploits of jugglers, and, supernatural power not being proved
by the miracle, a fortiori it would not be proof of a God.

If, however, any man possessed the apparent power of controlling not
some particular laws of nature but all laws of nature—if he actually
stopped the course of the sun, arrested the tides, changed the water of
the sea instantaneously from salt to fresh, & so on without limit; then
indeed he would prove by the direct testimony of sense that there
existed a supernatural power & that he was possessed of it. The fact is
that this would be an experience as complete as, & the exact counterpart
of, that which we should have of creation if we had ocular demonstration
of worlds similar to our own called into existence by a Will.

But if the apparently supernatural power only manifests itself in the
seeming supersession of a limited number of natural laws, the hypothesis
of its being done by means of other natural laws would be, as it seems
to me, intrinsically so much more probable, that nothing but the proved
impossibility of this could warrant the conclusion that the power was
supernatural. And this proof of impossibility it is evident could never
be obtained, in the existing or very probable future state of human
knowledge.

written to my daughter to ask her to use any influence she can to make

Dear Thornton—

I have to thank you again for one of your pleasant letters. I
congratulate you on having brought your book2 to a happy termination &
most heartily wish it the success with the public which I am sure it
deserves. Your description of your feeling of recovered liberty after
the completion of your book would seem to describe my feeling at having
recovered the free disposal of my time. I also like you have a great
arrear of miscellaneous reading to bring up, & this is not yet getting
itself done very quickly in consequence of other arrears. The printer is
making good progress with the Analysis3 & I hope to succeed in the
attempt to get it published by or soon after the 1st of March. From what
you say I hope to have read your book before that time. I have a good
deal to read and study before I next revise my Pol Economy for another
edition.4

Edition: current; Page: [1548]
What you say of Sir S. Northcote’s weakness of character, giving up good
reasons of his own to bad ones of other people, explains to me much of
his political life: how the more vigorous will of Sir C. Trevelyan kept
him true to his convictions as to competitive examinations5 & how his
honesty of purpose did not hinder him from going all lengths with
Disraeli though Disraeli did not convince his reason. I do not know what
sort of a Minister the D. of Argyll will turn out6 but I am glad you
have not got Bright7 who would have had much to unlearn, & very little
disposition to unlearn it. The two members of Council8 you mention are
not good average specimens, having been selected by the old body out of
their own number in consequence chiefly of their personal popularity,
which was in itself not undeserved.

We are glad you share in our estimate of our terrace,9 which so far from
being suppressed, has been nearly doubled in size, we having increased
the part of the house of which it is the roof, & added a bath room
thereto. Moreover Helen has carried out her long cherished scheme (about
which she tells me she consulted you) of a “vibratory”10 for me, & has
made a pleasant covered walk some 30 feet long where I can vibrate in
cold or rainy weather. Edition: current; Page: [1549] The terrace, you
must know, as it goes round two sides of the house, has got itself
dubbed the “semi-circumgyratory.”11 In addition to this, Helen has built
me a herbarium—a little room fitted up with closets for my plants,
shelves for my botanical books, & a great table whereon to manipulate
them all. Thus you see with my herbarium, my vibratory, & my
semi-circumgyratory I am in clover & you may imagine with what scorn I
think of the H. of C., which, comfortable club as it is said to be,
could offer me none of these comforts, or more properly speaking these
necessaries of life. Helen says your room is not finished yet, because
as she is an architect & master mason all in one, she is carrying on the
improvements very slowly, not letting the attention to them interfere

the outward aspect of our dear little cottage, which looks as small as

Dear Sir—

I thank you for your pamphlet.2 It is truly a frightful consideration
that the annual number of pupils who pass the highest grade in the
schools aided by Govt, i.e. who leave the schools able to read a
newspaper with understanding, is less than the number of teachers
(including pupil teachers) employed in the schools. To remedy such a
state of things as this requires a most earnest devotion of the
administration & probably of the legislative mind to the purpose. There
is no doubt that, as you say, a simplification of English orthography
would facilitate considerably the task of learning to read. A language
which like the Spanish of the present time has reduced its spelling to a
perfectly uniform system has a great advantage over others. But it would
take a much longer time to effect a change in orthography Edition:
current; Page: [1550] than would be required to teach every child in the
United Kingdom to read with facility. There certainly is no necessity
that it should take “seven years of the best learning period of a
child’s life” to teach him to read. So great a waste of time only proves
the wretchedness of the teaching. I myself cannot remember any time when
I could not read with facility & pleasure; & I have known other children
with whom this was the case. Such essays as yours, however, do good,
both by causing discussion, & by promoting useful though gradual change.
The Commission you propose would be useful in a similar manner but the
Govt may perhaps not think that a subject which does not come within the
province of direct legislation is a suitable subject for a Government
inquiry.3

Dear Sir—

I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 21st ulto,
proposing on the part of the American Social Science Association2 that I
shd visit the United States as their guest, & make a lecturing tour
through the Northern States under their auspices.

Few things could be more flattering to me than the high honour of such
an invitation from such a body; & your letter also contains proposals of
a pecuniary nature on such a scale of liberality as to convert a visit
to the U.S. from an expensive pleasure into a source of great personal
profit.3

The shortness, however, of life & the numerous unexecuted literary
projects which the public duties on which the greater part of my life
has been occupied have left on my hands, & which require all the leisure
of my remaining Edition: current; Page: [1551] years for their
fulfilment admonish me of the necessity of dividing such time as I am
able to dispose of between those undertakings & a rest more complete
than would be afforded by a journey such as that to which I am so
flatteringly invited.

These are the considerations which compel me to decline an invitation so
honourable, & which if I had more leisure & a greater number of years of
life in prospect, would have been so welcome to me.

Allow me in conclusion to express to yourself personally my sincere
acknowledgments of the friendly & courteous terms in which you have
communicated to me the proposal of the Association.

My dear Mrs Kyllmann—

I shd have answered your letter much earlier than this, but that ever
since I received it I have been so indisposed with a bad cold & headache
as to have been quite unable to write.

Like you we regret that your efforts to improve the Manchester Comee
were not more successful, but what you have done may perhaps prove of
use in the future.

Mr Mill & I are members of the London Comee & like the manner in which
it is carried on, & have much confidence in Mrs Taylor.2 We are sorry
that you see anything to object to in the form of petition used by the
London Comee, because it was drawn up by myself & approved by Mr Mill
before it was adopted. I do not think that if you examine it closely it
will be found in any degree to prejudge the question of the admission of
married women to the franchise. Mr Mill & I considered the wording of it
carefully, & it was written with the intention of leaving that question
open so that it could be signed both by those who do & by those who do
not approve of the admission of married women. It was certainly not the
intention of the London Comee to express any opinion on the point, or to
petition for the unmarried only. If there is any defect in the wording,
it is my fault, & Mr Mill’s (for we considered the wording of this
paragraph together) but I do not think that if the words are well
weighed with a precise attention to their meaning they will be found
open to this objection. At all events we used what power we have over
the English language to leave the question quite unsettled; & it was
Edition: current; Page: [1552] on the assumption that we had been
successful in doing so, that the London Comee adopted the form. We have
found that some persons have refused to sign the petition on the
contrary ground to yours, because they disapprove of the admission of
married women.

The West. Review has been since its first establishment the organ of the
most advanced radical party in England both as regards politics &
religious speculation; & it was for a very long time the only organ in
which anything of a very decidedly liberal character could appear in
print, & is still the only one in which articles of its length can
appear. It has been consistently of such (what are commonly called
“extreme”) opinions that it has been impossible to obtain a sufficiently
large circulation to make it profitable. It has often been carried on at
a pecuniary loss, & it is still not without great difficulty that the
editor is able to manage it. This of course it is not thought good for
its interests to make publicly known, but it has been necessary on
several occasions to have recourse to the friends (& unfortunately they
are but few in England) of free speculation in politics & religion to
tide over difficulties.3

We are very sorry to hear that your health is not good; we hope that
your visit to Germany may prove beneficial. We expect to be in England
by the middle of March, & shd be happy to see you at Blackheath if you
do not start before then and if you shd pass through London on your way.

Dear Dr. Tulloch

The three Essays which have been written this year for the Rectorial
Prize are of a high average of merit, though no one of them shows powers
of original thought quite equal to either of those to which the prize
was awarded in the two previous years. The one which stands highest in
this respect is that which bears the motto Quære verum and as its other
merits are at least equal Edition: current; Page: [1553] to those of
either of the others, I think it the most worthy of the Prize.2 But the
inferiority of the other two Essays is not very great; and I should like
to know the names of all the writers, as it would be a pleasure to me to
communicate with them and to send them some of my Books. There is no
part of my connexion with the University to which I look back with more
satisfaction than the response which has been made to my attempt to
co-operate with the University Authorities in encouraging a serious
study of the Philosophy of Mind. I hope that they are as well satisfied

Dear Mr Watson

I am much obliged to you for your kind present. You are right in
thinking that my absence from Parliament will give me more time for
botany. I am now looking through my herbarium for the first time since
the winter of 1864/5. But the scientific interest of your book2 gives it
a value to me beyond the purely botanical.

In regard to the Darwinian hypothesis,3 I occupy nearly the same
position as you do. Darwin has found (to speak Newtonially) a vera
causa, and has shewn that it is capable of accounting for vastly more
than had been supposed: Edition: current; Page: [1554] beyond that, it
is but the indication of what may have been, though it is not proved to
be, the origin of the organic world we now see. I do not think it an
objection that it does not, even hypothetically, resolve the question of
the first origin of life: any more than it is an objection to chemistry
that it cannot analyze beyond a certain number of simple or elementary
substances.

Your remark that the development theory naturally leads to convergences
as well as divergences4 is just, striking & as far as I know, has not
been made before. But does not this very fact resolve one of your
difficulties, viz. that species are not by divergence, multiplied to
infinity? since the variety is kept down by frequent blending. The
difficulty is also met by the fact that the law of natural selection
must cause all forms to perish except those which are superior to others
in power of keeping themselves alive in some circumstances actually
realized on the earth. I am

Dear Sir.

I do not believe nor I fancy does any one in the present day except
Mahometans & some other Orientals believe, that there is such a thing as
destiny in the sense in which you understand it. The only necessity in
events is, that causes produce effects, & means accomplish ends. Effects
never come but through their causes. By avoiding, to the utmost of one’s
power, all the causes of an effect, one greatly increases one’s chance
of avoiding the effect. And if one desires an end, one greatly increases
one’s chance of obtaining it by adopting some known means. It is true,
what we desire sometimes comes to pass without any effort of ours, &
what we dislike sometimes happens in spite of all we can do to avert it:
but our conduct has on the average many times more effect on the fate of
such of us as are not under the control of other people, than all other
circumstances put together. There is no doubt that if you adopt a
sailor’s life you have a greater chance of being drowned than in most
other occupations, because the causes which operate in that direction
occur oftener & are less (though still very much) under human control.
It is not therefore by any argument founded on destiny that Edition:
current; Page: [1555] you can hope to overcome the scruples of your
parents but rather by urging that all occupations are exposed to some
evil chances, that one may be too much afraid of death, & that if
persons of good health & strength were to avoid a really useful
employment like that of a sailor because of its dangers the world’s
affairs could not be carried on.

Feb. 8. 1869

Dear Sir—

I certainly do think your original plan of municipal government for
London,2 preferable to that of a single municipal government for the
Edition: current; Page: [1556] whole metropolis. When I first heard of
your plan it at once struck me as that which best met the real
difficulties of the case while it had also the advantage of being less
open to unreasonable as well as reasonable objections: this opinion has
been confirmed by the additional consideration which since the receipt
of your letter I have given to it. I will endeavour to put down what
occurs to me, for any use you like to make of it except sending it to
the press. I rather regretted that you published the letter I sent you
about police,3 not that there was anything in its substance that I could
wish to withhold from publicity, but because in a mere memorandum for a
friend, with whom one agrees generally in opinion, intended to be used
by him for what it may be worth as materials for forming his own
judgment, the same things are said in a different manner from that in
which one would address the public. Accordingly, though you used the
precaution of stating that the letter was to a private friend, the
newspapers took no notice of that, but judged the letter exactly as if
it had been written for the public, & charged it with dogmatism,
arrogance, & what not. These accusations are not a very great evil, but
there are so many purposes for which one is bound to risk them that it
is better not to court such occasions unnecessarily and in the case of
the letter I am now writing there are special reasons against
communicating it to those who are not to be taken into practical
council, which will appear in the very first things I have to say.

It is to my mind certain that Parliament will not tolerate the existence
in its immediate vicinity of another assembly resting on a broad basis
of popular election, wielding the power & disposing of the great amount
of revenue which would belong to a single body carrying on every branch
of local administration for the whole of London. The idea excited would
be that of the “Commune de Paris” during the Revolution. If therefore
the plan adopted is that of a single assembly, one of two things will
happen. Either, first, the power of the body will be extremely
curtailed. This may be done in one or both of two ways: by leaving much
of the administration in the hands of the parochial bodies, the vestries
& local boards, whom it is a great object to extirpate, root & branch;
or by withholding many of the most important parts of the local
administration from the Council, & either leaving those parts in their
present state of general neglect varied by fitful parliamentary
activity, or turning them over to a department of the central
government. These are modes in which the powers of the municipal body
may be brought within what Parliament would tolerate. The other course
which may be adopted is that of spoiling its constitution: either by
adopting a high electoral qualification, or by joining to the elected
members a certain number of members nominated by the government, or by
making the assent of a Minister necessary to their more important acts.
All these systems would be more intolerable to you & me & to most of
those who think with us on general politics than Edition: current; Page:
[1557] even the present irregularity & want of system, & would be far
more likely to last. These prudential reasons should, I think, prevent
our friends from encouraging, or consenting to support, any plan for a
single municipality.

But even in itself, a single municipality in so enormous a city seems to
me unlikely to work well. There is far too much work to be done; the
mass of details affecting only particular neighbourhoods, would leave
too little time or energy to the council for maturing & carrying out
general plans of improvement, and would, moreover, require it to be more
numerous than is quite consistent with that purpose. Those who hold up
as an example the local administration of Paris do not know what that
administration is. Letting alone the fact that every single person
connected with it is a Government nominee, it is not the fact that all
Paris is under a single municipal administration; there is indeed but
one Council, but there are 20 mayors, each of whom administers one of
the 20 arrondissements. It is as much a double administration as that
which would be given by our two bills, except that England being a free
country, our mayors must have councils, and popularly elected ones, to
assist & control them. I confess also I shd not like to restrict to a
single popular body all that exercise of the business faculties on
public concerns which does take place under the present local
institutions with all their imperfections & which in England, & still
more in America trains many men of no great ability or reach of thought
to be quite capable of discharging important public functions & of
watching & controlling their discharge by others. This is one of the
great differences between free & unfree countries—practical intelligence
in public affairs not confined to the government & its functionaries but
diffused among private citizens. Our Vestries are bad schools, but yet
those who organize public movements & bring the people of the locality
to act together for one object, have mostly gained their first
experience in the capacity of vestrymen & it might easily happen that
the too great concentration of municipal action might leave London
without a sufficient number of such persons.

Dear Mr. Leslie—

I have read your first letter in the Economist2 with great pleasure &
your paper on La Creuse3 with much interest & instruction. Edition:
current; Page: [1558] It is very important to put such points as it
contains before the conceited Englishmen who fancy they understand all
that relates to the land & politics of France when they do not know the
first rudiments of it, much less the many important matters you discuss.
I look forward with great expectation to the other papers which you
announce as in prospect,4 & shall not fail to weigh well what they say
on political economy.

Many thanks for the trouble you have taken for M. Chauffard’s
Mittermaier.5 I agree with you in going the complete length with Bentham
as to the admissibility of evidence.6 There are I believe frequent cases
like that you mention, of practical mischief both to the accused & to
others from his not being examined as a witness. The one point on which
alone B seems to me to be wrong is in allowing the judge to interrogate.
But I have recently seen it stated that the prodigious abuse of this
power which takes place in France, is in part owing to the fact that men
are almost always made judges from having been public prosecutors, i.e.
persons the whole business of whom it has been to find evidence of
guilt: & not as with us from among barristers who have equally often had
the duty of finding evidence of innocence. The reason is that the
salaries of judges are not worth the acceptance of an advocate in good
practice, & the salaries are small because in France there are
everywhere courts of five judges or more where a much smaller number &
in general one judge would suffice: thus does a single error in a system
engender a series of others.

The physical illustrations in my Logic7 were all reviewed & many of them
suggested by Bain, who has a very extensive & accurate knowledge of
physical science. He has promised me to revise them thoroughly for the
next edition,8 & to put them sufficiently in harmony with the progress
of science, which I am quite aware that they have fallen behind.

Your letter & the proposed address enclosed in it, reached me several

I do not think I could go to the full length of what is claimed in the
address. I am very doubtful if the Govt ought to release all who may lie
in prison for being connected for instance with the Clerkenwell
outrage,3 or for having joined in the Fenian invasion of Canada.4 To
those political prisoners who have shed no blood, or have shed it in the
way of what may be called fair or legitimate insurrection on Irish soil
I would, simultaneously with a fresh act of justice to Ireland, grant a
full pardon with a public declaration that it is done from the hope that
the willingness practically shewn to redress Irish injuries by
legislation would induce the Irish in future to seek for redress only in
that way & would thus render legal punishment unnecessary: But in
rebellion as in war it seems to me that a distinction shd be made
between fair weapons or modes of warfare & foul ones. And a good deal of
thought would be required to decide exactly where the line should be
drawn.

Feb. 9, 1869

My dear Sir—

Ever since reading your book,2 which a variety of occupations prevented
me from doing until very lately, I have felt desirous of expressing to
you the very high sense I entertain of its merits, and the great
Edition: current; Page: [1560] pleasure which, as one who has turned
much of his attention to the same subjects, I have felt at seeing such a
number of sound judgments and such a sustained tone of right and worthy
feeling, sent forth to the world in a style so likely to command
attention, and by one who has now the additional vantage-ground of a
seat in Parliament. It is long since any book, connected with practical
politics, has been published, on which I build such high hopes of the
future usefulness and distinction of the writer; showing as it does that
he not only possesses a most unusual amount of real knowledge on many of
the principal questions of the future, but a mind strongly predisposed
to what are (at least in my opinion) the most advanced and enlightened
views of them.

There are so few opinions expressed in any part of your book with which
I do not, as far as my knowledge extends, fully and heartily coincide,
that I feel impelled to take the liberty of noting the small number of
points, of any consequence, on which I differ from you. These relate
chiefly to India; though, on that subject also, I agree with you to a
much greater extent than I differ. Not only do I most cordially
sympathize with all you say about the insolence of the English, even in
India, to the native population, which has now become, not only a
disgrace, but, as you have so usefully shown, a danger to our dominion
there; but I have been much struck by the sagacity which, in so short a
stay as yours must have been, has enabled you to detect facts which are
as yet obvious to very few: as, for instance, the immense increase of
all the evils and dangers you have pointed out, by the substitution of
the Queen’s army for a local force of which both men and officers had at
least a comparatively permanent tie in the country; and again, that the
superior authority in England, having the records of all the
Presidencies before it, and corresponding regularly with them all, is
the only authority which really knows India; the local governments and
officers only knowing, at most, their own part of it, and having
generally strong prejudices in favour of the peculiarities of the system
of government there adopted and against those of the other parts. I
observe that your preferences seem to be, as mine are, for the systems
which give permanent rights of property to the actual cultivator, which
is best done in the modern Bombay ryot-war system. I am sorry to say
that there is at present a strong reaction in favour of setting up
landlords everywhere,3 and what is worst, I am told, that this prevails
most among the younger men (the hide-bound Toryism of Sir William
Mansfield assisting); and there is great mischief of this kind in
progress both in the Punjab and in the Central Provinces,
notwithstanding the contrary predilections of Sir John Lawrence. What
will happen under the Irish landlord who is now Viceroy,4 I dread to
think.

Edition: current; Page: [1561]
But have you not, on the questions which concern the English planters,
leant too much to their side? You have yourself stigmatized their
treatment of the natives; and what better can be expected in a country
where a station master kicks and cuffs the passengers and a captain of a
steamer kicks the pilot round the deck whenever the vessel runs
aground?5 If it could be right to make the breach of a contract to
labour for the planters, under habitual treatment of this sort from them
and their low nigger-drivers, a penal offence, the evil could not be so
flagrant as your book shews it to be, and as it undoubtedly is: Another
thing to be considered is that either a most unjust advantage would be
given to European over native landholders and employers of labour, or
the same legal remedy must be granted to both; and I suppose, even those
who think that an English indigo planter and his underlings would not
suborn witnesses to depose falsely in a criminal court, will admit that
a native landowner would.

In your plan for the improvement of the organ of Indian government in
England, you shew a just and enlightened appreciation of the necessity
of making the organ a permanent one, in the sense of not going out with
the Ministry. But this will not, and cannot be, if the organ is a
Secretary of State, or any member of the Cabinet. No one who does not go
out when the majority in Parliament changes, will, or ought to have a
voice in the Cabinet which decides the general policy of the country.
Neither is it likely to be thought right, nor indeed would it be right,
that the Government of the empire should have no voice, not even a
negative one, in the administration of its greatest dependency. If,
then, the head administrator of India were not to be in the Cabinet, we
should find that a Cabinet minister would be set over him to control
him, as one was set to control the Court of Directors: and the nominal
administrator, being only one person, and that one of inferior official
rank, would have no power of resistance and would sink into a mere
deputy. Would this be any improvement? I have always myself thought that
a Board or Council for India, with a Cabinet minister to control them
but not to sit among them, was the really best system for India: and I
have given my reasons for this in the concluding chapter of my book on
Representative Government.6 It is, however, impracticable to go back to
this: and under the present system I think your own opinions will lead
you to the conclusion that the Secretary of State must necessarily
change with the Government and that the real knowledge of India which
you hope to obtain in him by making him permanent, can only be found in
a Council of advisers with at least as great powers as the present
Council. It is quite another question whether the Council ought not to
be more rapidly renewed. I am much disposed to think with you that its
members should only be appointed (and should, exceptis excipiendis, only
hold their seats) for five years: but, I think, they ought to Edition:
current; Page: [1562] be fully as numerous as at present, that all the
different systems of administration in India may have somebody there who
knows them well enough and has sufficient sympathy with them to correct
any misunderstanding to their advantage.

You suggest that we should issue a proclamation declaring that for the
future we will “invariably recognize the practice of adoption of
children by the native rulers, as we have done in the case of the Mysore
succession.”7 But this is what was actually done by Lord Canning’s
famous Proclamation:8 and the hesitation about Mysore only arose from a
doubt whether the great peculiarities of that case did not afford to
those who disliked the Proclamation, some ground for contending that to
that particular ruler (or nominal ruler) our faith was not pledged: It
is a significant fact that not a single native ruler, with the doubtful
exception of Dharwar, and the certain one of a few Delhi Jagendars to
whom had been granted some amount of independent jurisdiction, went
against us in the mutiny.9 The Hyderabad State did us real service by
standing by us. The native princes are much more influenced by fear of
anarchy, and of possible Sivajees10 and Hyder Ali’s,11 than by dislike
of us.

I have noticed a few minor inaccuracies of fact on Indian matters;
surprisingly few, considering all the circumstances. You say that the
Persians and Afghans are Sheeahs, while our own Mussulmans are
orthodox.12 The Afghans, unless my memory totally deceives me, are firm
Soonees, the only Sheeahs in Afghanistan being the Kuzzilbashes, i.e.
the Persian traders and settlers. Again, there are a good many Sheeahs
in India, and I even think that the royal family of Oude were so.

It is rather harsh to call the Bengalees (p. 366) mere savages. As you
doubtless know that some of them are the most cultivated of all the
Hindoos, I conjecture that the Bengalees you mean are the Southals, or
the wilder Garrows, Kookees, &c. and “the tribes of Central India” in
the same passage are the Goands, Coles and other Aborigines. “Central
India” includes the large province of Nagpore, or Berar, and the Sanger
and Nerbuddo districts formerly attached to it; territories as popular,
peaceable, and highly cultivated as most parts of India.

The working of the system of native assessors in courts of justice I
only know practically in the case of the criminal international
tribunals we have established in many districts—and in which the
assessors are persons of some Edition: current; Page: [1563]
consequence: and there, having reviewed hundreds of the trials, I can
testify that their opinion is often given against that of the presiding
British officer, and that he shews considerable practical deference to
it, especially as to the amount of punishment, for the sake of
reconciling the native chiefs to these tribunals.

I was puzzled when I came, at p. 382, to the assertion, that
“Switzerland is the home of the worst of bigotry and intolerance.” This
is quite contrary to my impression of the religious condition of
Switzerland.

You see that in order to find fault with anything, I have very soon got
down to extremely small points, or to such as have very little to do
with the general scope of the work. If there is any criticism of a
somewhat broader character that I could make, I think it would be
this—that (in speaking of the physical and moral characteristics of the
populations descended from the English) you sometimes express yourself
almost as if there were no sources of national character but race and
climate—as if whatever does not come from race must come from climate,
and whatever does not come from climate must come from race. But as you
shew, in many parts of your book, a strong sense of the good and bad
influences of education, legislation, and social circumstances, the only
inference I draw is that you do not, perhaps, go so far as I do myself
in believing these last causes to be of prodigiously greater efficacy
than either race or climate or the two combined.

Thanking you most sincerely for the great pleasure and the very valuable
information I have received from your book, I am

my dear Sir,

Feb. 16, 1869

Dear Sir

When your letter reached me, I happened to be particularly busy, and
some days elapsed before I had time to read the article of which you
forwarded to me a proof. My opinion of the article is such as it would
be very painful to me to express to a writer your account of whom
excites so much personal sympathy, and whose errors, if they be so, are
on the side of Edition: current; Page: [1564] Liberty; but I differ so
completely from the practical conclusions of the article, not only on
the points you mention but on almost every other, and a great proportion
of its arguments both when I do not, and in the few cases in which I do
agree with it, seem to me so weak and shallow, that I should regret to
see the Westminster Review identifying itself with the writer’s
opinions. A review in which the writers assumed the sole responsibility
of their articles by affixing their signatures, would be in a rather
different position. The Westminster used to have a department for
articles which it thought worthy of publication without wishing to
commit the Review to any greater degree of approval. Would it not be
possible to put the article into that department?2

Respecting the French system of relief of the poor,3 what inaccuracy
there is in the statements of the article is in saying that the French
government “leaves the relief of the poor to private benevolence.” The
poor have in France no legal right to relief, nor is relief granted (any
more than in England) directly by the State; but very large sums, raised
by taxation, are annually granted by the municipal councils, which are
not, as in England, confined to a few towns, but cover the whole
country; and these bodies also undertake the expenditure of sums
contributed for the purpose by individuals. That the French poor are
‘quite as well if not better off than in England’ is difficult either to
prove or disprove: the question has too many meanings, and requires
consideration of so many circumstances. But if they are better off, it
certainly is not for the reason alleged, for the public and private
charity of France has precisely the same demoralizing effects as an ill
administered poor law.

Your idea respecting Mr Peabody4 is good. I think the best mode of
carrying it out would be to endeavour to interest him in the position of
the Review without making a direct application for money, as he must be
so overwhelmed with the number of such applications that his spontaneous
impulse must always be to reject them. I am not acquainted with Mr
Peabody, and cannot give an introduction to him; but one of my friends
and correspondents at New York. Mr Brace5 (whom perhaps you know) seems
to me a likely person to be able to judge in what manner it may be best
to approach him; and, if you approve, I will advise with Mr Brace on the
subject.

With regard to the new edition of my father’s Analysis,6 there is,
forunately Edition: current; Page: [1565] for the book, but
unfortunately for the Review, a serious obstacle to Mr Grote’s writing a
review of it, namely that he is himself the author of some of the notes.
I should have no difficulty in getting the sheets beforehand, and the
book itself will, I hope, be published very early in March.7

Dear Sir—

If my letter gave you pleasure, yours has repaid it, not merely by the
good part in which you have taken my criticisms, but because it contains
things which confirm the best points of the conception I had formed of
you from your book. What you call a “traveller’s trick” of gathering
information from prejudiced and interested persons on both sides of
every question is a trick which I wish many travellers would imitate,
for it is simply the only way to form even an approximate judgment of
the truth. But this mode of enquiry though the only one which brings out
the most precious materials of knowledge, very much disturbs the process
of adopting opinions ready made.

My object, however, in writing, is not to say this, but to express the
pleasure it will give me to see you when I return to England, which will
be in the course of next month, and to answer, as well as I can, your
question about Tocqueville’s manuscripts.2 The person who is sure to
possess full information about them and who probably has them in his
charge is M. Ch. Revel,3 ancien Conseiller d’Etat whose address when I
last corresponded with him (which however was several years ago) was 8
Rue du Marché d’Aguesseau, Edition: current; Page: [1566] Paris. Or you
might apply to the publisher of the collected edition of Tocqueville’s

Dear Miss Cobbe,

I have lately received communication from the American publisher
Putnam,2 requesting me to write for their Magazine, and I understand
that they would be very glad if you would write anything for them, more
especially on the Women question,3 on which the Magazine (a new one) has
shown liberal tendencies from the first. The communications I have
received have been through Mrs. Hooker,4 sister of Mrs. Stowe5 and Dr.
Ward Beecher,6 and herself the author of two excellent articles in the
Magazine on the suffrage question,7 by which we had been much struck
before we knew the authorship. I enclose Mrs. Hooker’s last letter to
me, and I send by post copies of Mrs. Hooker’s articles and some old
numbers of the Magazine, the only ones we have here; and I shall be very
happy if I should be the medium of inducing you to write on this
question for the American public.

My daughter desires to be kindly remembered, and I am,

Dear Miss Cobbe,

P.S.—May I ask you to be so kind as to forward Mrs. Hooker’s letter to

Dear Sir—

The mode in which Convergence2 seems to me to combine itself with
divergence in the generation of species, resembles what happens in the
growth of a tree. The shoots from one of the larger branches approach &
meet those from another, so that a large part of the growth of both is
in the direction contrary to divergence, while yet the general
circumference constantly enlarges, so that divergence, though limited by
the counter-principle is yet in respect of the distance between its
extremes, perpetually widening.

I do not understand that when Darwin adopted as his title “The Origin of
Species by means of Natural Selection” he meant by “origin of species”
the cause of there being any species, or any diversity in organic
nature. He seems to me to mean what you mean by the Formation of
Species,3 viz. the origin of the species which now exist on the earth.

But I have not yet read, though I hope soon to have time to read, his
latest & longest work.4

Dear Sir

Want of time has prevented me from immediately answering or
acknowledging your letter of Jan 31; but you must not suppose, when this
is the case, Edition: current; Page: [1568] that I overlook your letters
or that they are not both interesting and useful to me.

I have not forgotten the list of books which you wished for; but
hitherto when I have seen one of them in a bookseller’s catalogue and
have had time to go for it (not liking to buy a book without seeing it)
I have found it gone. I may be more successful now, when my time will
not be occupied by Parliament. It is unlucky that all the books you ask
for the loan of, are books that I have not got. I wish there were any
good history of the period you mention in England. Some portions of that
period have been written about, but I do not know what books to
recommend.

I am not acquainted with the letter you mention of Mr. Odger;2 but
though he may have made an occasional mistake of judgment, I have a very
high opinion of him both as to intentions and intelligence. Mr.
Hartwell3 was not one of those working men whose candidature I helped
though I was asked to do so: but though I myself knew nothing to his
disadvantage, I had not evidence in his favour, as I had in the other
cases. With regard to yourself, I have now had considerable means of
judging of you from your letters, and as far as those means extend I
should certainly say that you are one of the working men whom I should
be glad to see in Parliament.

I am afraid, however, we should differ about the Factory Laws; though I
doubt not that there are points in their working which require to be
looked to, and probably defects which you would be able to point out.
You seem, however, to object to their principle when you say they imply
“either that the English manufacturer is of such a grasping spirit that
he must needs be curbed lest he should overwork the juvenile portion of
his employes as to deteriorate the population of the country; or, on the
other hand, that the English parent is so needy or sordidly ignorant or
brutishly cruel that he may not be trusted with the care and welfare of
his own children, but that the State must undertake these duties for
him.” Of the two things which you thus put alternatively, I believe both
to be true: not, of course, true in all cases, or up to any extreme, but
true to a sufficient extent and of a sufficient number to make it
disastrous to leave the children, without legal protection, to the mere
discretion of any kind of parents and any kind of employers of labour.

With regard to Boards of Arbitration, I do not as far as I am able to
judge of the subject, think it possible to constitute an authority
sufficiently capable, sufficiently trustworthy, or sufficiently likely
to be trusted by both sides, to Edition: current; Page: [1569] make it
at all admissable that their award should be legally obligatory, unless
the two parties to the dispute have beforehand voluntarily agreed to be
bound by it. In this case they should of course be held to their pledge.

I am, however, so much occupied, that I have not time to write out my
ideas on either of these subjects, and am forced to be content with a
brief indication of them, which I do not wish published. I am

Dear Sir—

You ask my opinion concerning Mr Spencer’s “First Principles” &
“Principles of Biology” as contributions to the advance of thought.2 I
answer that I attach to them, in that respect, the very highest value. I
am the more completely disinterested in this high estimation of them, as
their line of investigation is extremely different & remote from my own,
& I am far from being prepared (I do not know if Mr Spencer himself is
prepared) to consider the long series of his conclusions as definitively
proved. Still, it is not solely as a wonderful exhibition of connected &
systematic thought, that these works appear to me worthy of admiration.
They seem to me to hold a most important place in the scientific thought
of the age. Within the present generation several large & comprehensive
generalizations have made their way into Science—the Unity &
Conservation of Force, the Darwinian theory of organic development, &
(though this is rather a branch of the last) the hereditary transmission
of acquired faculties. All these theories rest, in part, on well
ascertained facts, while all of them, even the first, & much more the
two others still remain hypothetical as to a great part of the extent &
the application claimed for them. At this critical period in what will
probably turn out to be one of the great transformations in Science,
nothing could be more fortunate than that some person, with faculties so
peculiarly adapted to the purpose as Mr Spencer’s shd have taken up the
explanation of Nature on the new principles synthetically, setting out
from them as true, & working out in detail what sort of an explanation
they are capable of affording of the complicated world in which we live.
Until this attempt was made, the theories in question, considered as
universal laws of nature, could be neither verified nor disproved. And
arduous as the attempt is, no one who studies these works of Mr Spencer
is likely to deny that it has been made by a mind equal to it, & that it
will mark a step in the progress of thought even if posterity should
pronounce it (which I certainly do not expect) to be a splendid failure.
Of Mr Spencer’s other writings it is unnecessary at present to say more
than that I consider the contributions made to the analytic study of the
human mind by the “Principles of Psychology” alone an ample foundation
for a distinguished philosophical reputation.

Dear Sir:

I beg to acknowledge your letter of the 8th ultimo, with its inclosures
respecting a plan for systematic emigration to Canada. The time is very
favourable for the reception of such a plan in this country, as
attention has of late been called in an unusual degree to the miserable
state of the English agricultural laborers, and to the possibility of
making emigration available for their relief; and Mr. Goschen,2 the new
President of the Poor Law Board, has declared in Parliament that the
subject is under his consideration, with a view, however, to the United
States rather than to Canada.3

It would be highly desirable that the promoters of your plan should
enter into direct communication with Mr. Goschen, and that he should be
enabled as soon as possible to judge what amount of assistance the
Canadian Government may be willing to offer toward the cost of the
emigration.

Dear Sir—

Immediately on receiving your letter of January 19, I wrote to Sir
Charles Trevelyan, who is the principal author of Competitive
Examination as applied to the Civil Service in England and India.2 He at
once undertook to write to you, and to furnish you with all the
information in his power, and I presume he has done so before this time.
The question seems to me, if possible, even more important in the United
States than in this country. I have long thought that the appointments
to office, without regard to qualifications, are the worst side of
American institutions: the main cause of what is justly complained of in
their practical operation, and the principal hindrance to the correction
of what is amiss; as well as a cause of ill-repute to democratic
institutions all over the world. If appointments were given, not by
political influence, but by open competition, the practice of turning
out the holders of office, at every change in politics, in order to
reward partisans, would necessarily cease, and with it nearly all the
corruption and the larger half of the virulence of mere party conflict.
I have been delighted to see that Mr. Jenckes’ measure3 meets with
increasing support from disinterested Edition: current; Page: [1573]
opinion, though it will have to encounter the utmost hostility from the
professional politicians who are the great perverters of free
government. . . .

there Edition: current; Page: [1575] is much of it with which I do not

The National Society for Women’s Suffrage has decided to try to get up a
petition to Parliament this year from every borough in England in favour

borough. The Society has found friends and correspondents in all but
about ninety boroughs, and a list of these ninety has been sent to my

interest themselves in getting signatures to a petition. Among these
boroughs which the Society has as yet no correspondents is Stoke upon

matter. What is wanted is simply to give away copies of the pamphlets

friends, and to solicit signatures to the petition as widely as
possible, giving a copy of the petition to be filled in with signatures
to everybody who you think will be willing to interest him or herself in
getting it filled. There is no need that the petition should be sent up

Dear Sir—

I shall have much pleasure in writing a notice of Mr. Thornton’s book
for the “Edinburgh Review,”2 and shall, of course, put what I have to
say in a form somewhat different from that in which I should write for
another publication. My own point of view does not exactly coincide
either with that of Mr. Thornton or with that of the “Edinburgh”
Reviewer to whom he refers;3 and, of course, I must be free to express
my own view, and that only. Mr. Thornton is certainly a defender of
trades-unions, to the extent of thinking that their existence is an
important defence and protection to the operatives, and that they often
cause a rise of wages when, though right and desirable, it would not
otherwise have taken place. On these points, I think, Mr. Thornton has
fully made out his case. On the other hand, he condemns some of the aims
and rules of trades-unions; and is quite alive to their liability to
carry their legitimate aims (rise of wages and diminished hours of work)
to a length which may injure both themselves and their employers by
driving the trade elsewhere. For the correction of this evil he looks to
the lessons of experience and increased intelligence, and to amiable
discussion between the parties. In these various opinions I entirely
agree, and I should feel bound to express them in anything I write on
the subject. It is for you to decide whether they would be unsuitable
for publication in the “E. Review.”

Edition: current; Page: [1577]
With regard to your suggestion for reviewing the Report of the
Commission,4 do you purpose that this should be done in the same or in a
separate article? Since, in that case, it would be necessary to express
an opinion on the question of prohibiting by law those employments of
trades-union funds which may be decided to be illegitimate; and,
moreover, of giving efficacy to the legal prohibition by the appointment
of a public prosecutor expressly for its enforcement. These are very
grave questions, and I am not yet prepared to give a final opinion on
every part of them, though I am clearly against adopting some of the
recommendations of the majority of the Commission, as reported in
to-day’s papers.5 I think that the systematic enforcement of legal
penalties against strikes, even for undesirable objects, would be the
commencement of a feud between employers and workmen, and between
workmen and the Government, more internecine than we have ever yet seen.

March 19. 1869

J’avais remarqué, mon cher M. Villari, que depuis longtemps je n’avais
pas de vos nouvelles; cette intermission n’est que trop expliquée par la
lettre que je viens de recevoir. La sympathie la plus vive et la plus
sincère ne peut presque rien pour consoler dans un si grand malheur.2
Dans l’affreuse souffrance des premiers temps c’est presqu’une moquerie
que d’en offrir. Maintenant le temps est venu pour vous de ce profond
abattement, cette perte de tout intérêt dans la vie, que je comprends si
bien, et qui serait presqu’aussi dur à supporter, s’il n’y avait un
moyen un seul, de soulagement, pour celui qui est capable de trouver un
attrait dans le travail désintéressé pour le bien des autres. Ceux
qu’une grande douleur privée a dégoûtés de tous les intérêts personnels,
ont souvent fini par trouver une véritable consolation et un
renouvellement d’energie dans la concentration de leur sensibilité et de
leur intelligence sur des travaux ayant pour but l’amélioration morale,
intellectuelle ou physique de leur semblables. C’est là ce que j’espère
pour vous. Vous êtes un homme très précieux pour votre pays, très
supérieur par la pensée et par les talents au niveau commun des hommes
dans quelque pays que ce soit. Nul pays plus que le vôtre n’a besoin de
ces qualités dans ses citoyens et aucun n’offre un champ plus vaste et
plus propice pour les exercer. Vous avez un amour de votre pays qui je
suis sûr, n’a pas sombré dans le naufrage de votre bonheur personnel.
Tout ce qu’il y a de soulagement possible dans un malheur comme le
vôtre, vous l’éprouverez quand vous vous sentirez capable de vous
remettre à quelque travail important pour le bien général, et de nature
à exiger toutes vos forces intellectuelles.

Vous trouverez peutêtre que je parle bien à mon aise de travail à un
homme accablé de douleur, étant moi même dans un état de contentement
personnel que je n’avais éprouvé de longtemps. En effet, je suis comme
un soldat licencié qui retourne à ses foyers pour y jouir du plus grand
privilège qu’une vie de travail puisse offrir, le libre choix de ses
occupations. Pendant que j’étais député je ne jouissais cette liberté
que pendant trois ou quatre mois de l’année. Pendant ce temps je vaquais
à mes études philosophiques, et j’avais préparé une nouvelle édition du
grand traité de psychologie de mon père,3 avec des notes par moi même et
par d’autres de ses successeurs dans la même école philosophique. Cette
nouvelle édition vient d’être livrée au public, et Edition: current;
Page: [1579] l’exemplaire que je vous avais envoyé avant de recevoir
votre lettre, vous parviendra, j’espère, en peu de jours. Maintenant je
vais publier un travail où la question des femmes4 est traitée avec plus
d’étendue que dans tout ce qui a paru jusqu’ici en faveur de leur
affranchissement. Cette cause fait ici un progrès très rapide, et un si
grand nombre de femmes, et des plus distinguées, ont répondu à l’appel

Dear Mr Fawcett

I have considerable difficulty in judging from outside of any question
of political tactics, during the present transitional state of politics.
And the questions you put to me are essentially questions of tactics;2
for, on the substantial issues, there can hardly be any difference of
opinion. The landlords undoubtedly get what they have no right to; for
though they are charged a fair price for the tithe, the State, in one
sense of the word, pays that price for them, by lending them money at a
much lower rate than they themselves can borrow at; just as it lends
them its money or credit for the improvement of their land. Thus it
undoubtedly makes a present to them; but as that present costs itself
nothing, consisting only in giving them the benefit of its better
credit, the Government may be right, as a matter of tactics, in granting
them this advantage, which costs nothing to anybody. Again, to employ
the resumed national property, or a part of it, in education, would be a
far better Edition: current; Page: [1580] application of it than the one
proposed; but the measure would then no longer tend to a reconcilement
of religious differences. The application of any of the money to the
Queen’s Colleges or to undenominational schools, would be vehemently
opposed by the whole Catholic party. The battle of unsectarian education
will have to be fought, but we may hope to fight it with better support
if this measure has first passed, retaining completely the character of
a healing measure. It seems to me too that Ireland has a just claim on
the general taxation of the empire for all that it requires in the way
of education: and inasmuch as unsectarian education is contrary to the
wish of the great majority of the Irish people, that at least can with
much greater propriety be charged upon general taxation, than upon a
fund belonging to Ireland, as the Church property does. What can be said
on the other side of both these points will occur to yourself; and I am
by no means against criticising these provisions of the Bill in a
speech. With regard to any directly hostile movement against them (which
would certainly be unsuccessful) I doubt if any advantage would arise
from it equivalent to the bad effect of an apparent want of unanimity in
the Liberal party in carrying through this measure. I do not feel able
to give a more positive opinion on the subject.

My daughter desires to be kindly remembered to Mrs Fawcett and yourself,
and I am

Dear Sir—

The idea of an Academy of Moral & Political Science has often presented
itself to my mind; as it could hardly fail to present itself to any one
who has been all his life speculating & thinking on social questions &
who has studied the institutions and ideas of foreign countries. But the
result of the thought I have given to the subject, has always been
unfavourable.

Edition: current; Page: [1581]
The Society, or Academy, would either be a public body, or a mere
private association. If a public body, the original members would be
named by the Government; subsequent vacancies might be filled up, as in
France, by the votes of the body itself. If the Govt acted honestly in
the matter, which we will suppose it to do, it would appoint the persons
of highest reputation as writers or thinkers on moral, social, &
political subjects without (it is to be hoped) any regard to their
opinions; for to pay any regard to these would simply mean to exclude
all whose opinions were in advance of the age. This then being supposed,
what sort of a body would be the result? An assemblage of persons of
utterly irreconcilable opinions, who would hardly ever be sufficiently
unanimous on any question to exercise, as a body, any moral or
intellectual influence over it; while amidst this medley of opinions
there would be an assured majority in favour of what is conservative &
commonplace, because such is invariably the tendency of the majority of
those whose reputation is already made. In consequence, the subsequent
elections by the members, to fill vacancies, would be decidedly worse
than we are supposing the original choice to be; for men of the highest
eminence would often not be elected if any of their opinions were
obnoxious to the arriéré majority. Guizot,2 Thiers,3 & Cousin4 while he
lived, ruled the French Academy of Moral & Political Sciences & very few
who were not of their opinions were, or now are, admitted into it.5 The
Académie Française rejected Littré,6 the man who by his single efforts
was doing admirably the whole work which the Academy was specially
appointed to do. Even Academies of physical science in which there is
less difference of opinions, always consist, in majority, of trained
mediocrities, while the men whose footsteps mark the great advances in
science often do not succeed during their whole lives in obtaining
admission. Originality, scientific genius, is in general looked shyly
upon by the majority of scientific men; & it is of the majority that
Academies, however honestly constituted, will be the representatives.

If, on the other hand, the Society was not a public organised body, but
was composed of volunteers rallying round some common standard, it would
not materially differ from any voluntary association of persons agreeing
in some of their opinions & would carry no more weight than any other
set of men who unite to assist and back one another in the propagation
of their particular doctrines.

It does not seem to me possible by any combination, to make the
collective force of scientific thought available as a power in social
affairs. The French Edition: current; Page: [1582] Academies never have
been such a power: the Academy of Moral & Political Sciences is neither
consulted, nor, as a body, puts forth any opinions, or exercises any
moral or political action, except by offering prizes for Essays. Its
Transactions, consisting of the papers read before it, are published,
but one seldom sees them quoted or referred to. Its individual members
have such influence as their talents or character may give them, but
collective influence it has none.

Having given you the reasons which make me fear that the results you
anticipate from the formation of an Academy of M. & P.S. would not be
realised, allow me now to express the great pleasure which our short
conversation gave me & the satisfaction I should have in cooperating
with you on the subject of the Alabama claims7 & I doubt not, on many
other important matters. There is such a lack of energy & earnestness in
all classes above manual labourers, & those who have any wish or
capacity for improved ideas are so shrinkingly afraid of what will be
said of them & so daunted by the smallest obstacle that it is a dies
albo notandus8 on which one meets with any man of intelligence who feels
and thinks as you did both in the Commons Socy,9 in our conversation
afterwards & now in your letter.

I was much surprised at what seemed like a proposal on your part to
write reviews both of the Trades-Union Commission Report and also of Mr.
Thornton’s book;2 and I am not at all surprised to find that your
meaning was to include a review of both in one article. This, however,
will not suit me, nor, indeed, could I undertake a review of the Trades
Commission Report,3 even separately, for a considerable time to come;
and I do not intend to defer writing on Mr. Thornton’s book until I
write on the Trades Commission Report. For this and various other
reasons, with many apologies for the trouble I have given you, I decide
to withdraw my proposal altogether. I am much obliged to you for your
willingness to insert an article by me on a subject in which there are

The purpose of those who have projected the Society2 mentioned in your
letter is a laudable one, but it is very doubtful whether it will be
realised in practice. Oral discussion on matters dependent on reasoning
may be much more thorough than when carried on by written discourse, but
only I think if undertaken in the manner of the Socratic dialogue,
between one and one. None of the same advantages are obtained when the
discussion is shared by a mixed assemblage. Even, however, as a kind of
debating society on these great questions the Society may be useful,
especially to its younger members. But my time is all pre-engaged to
other occupations, and I do not expect any such benefit, either to
others or to myself, from my taking part in the proceedings of the
Society, as would justify me in putting aside other duties in order to
join it.

It is very natural that those who are strongly convinced of the truth of
their opinions should think that those who differ from them do not duly
weigh their arguments.3 I can only say that I sincerely endeavour to do
the amplest justice to any argument which is urged, and to all I can
think of even when not urged, in defence of any opinions which I
controvert.

It is not desired that the petitions should be presented
simultaneously.2 They are presented as they come in; and there is seldom
a sitting of the House at which one or more are not presented. But as
they will not be too late any Edition: current; Page: [1585] period of
the session, it is worth while to keep them back as long as there seems
a prospect of obtaining more signatures to them.

The rules of the House require that petitions should be in manuscript
not print. The printed copies are circulated for signature, and the
signatures afterwards cut off, and pasted or gummed on to the
manuscript; not forgetting, however, that there must be at least one
signature on the very sheet on which the petition is written.

When I leave unnoticed any point in your letter, you may safely ascribe
it to want of leisure. Your views on the registration of voters being
very much in accordance both with my own, and with those which seem to
me to be generally entertained by the Liberal party, I had no particular
reason for dwelling on the subject.

I am glad we do not differ fundamentally on the subject of the Factory
Acts. I am quite prepared to find that the provision for education in
those Acts, though effectual in some cases, is almost inoperative in

Dear Lord Amberley

It gave me much pleasure to hear from you, and to find my anticipation
confirmed, that you would enjoy your liberation from trammels as much as
I do myself.2 There certainly is no blessing in human life comparable to
liberty; for those at least, who having any good uses to put it to, can
indulge themselves in it with a good conscience. I envy you the pleasure
of having got to a Latin classic.3 I hope to be able to give myself the
same satisfaction Edition: current; Page: [1586] by and by. I have not
read a Greek or Latin book for at least half a dozen years, with the
exception of Plato, whom I read quite through preparatory to reviewing
Mr Grote’s account of him.4 Cicero’s philosophical writings are very
pleasant reading and of considerable value historically, as our
principal authority for much of the speculations of the Greek
philosophical sects, and a brilliant specimen of the feelings of the
best sort of accomplished and literary Romans towards the close of the
Republic: but as philosophy they are not worth much, and I like his
Orations and Letters better. It is true I am much interested in
everything that relates to that great turning point of history, the
going out of what was left of liberty in the ancient world; and that
calm after the storm, that tragical pause at the beginning of the
down-hill rush, which is called the Augustan age—so solemn in its
literary monuments,5 so deformed by the presence of Augustus in it.6 No
historian has treated that cunning, base, and cruel adventurer as he
deserved, except Arnold in the Enc. Metropolitana,7 and Ampère in
“L’Empire Romain à Rome”:8 merely because Virgil and Horace flattered
him.

But this kind of reading after all is but recreation, unless one is
making a particular study of history in order to write it, or for some
philosophical purpose. Psychology, ethics, and politics in the widest
sense of the term, are the really important studies now, both for one’s
own instruction, and for exercising a useful influence over others.

The Endowed Schools Bill9 will do a great deal of good, if the proper
use is made of the powers which it assumes; and Forster’s speech10 shews
that he at least intends to do the best. Let us hope that he will have
sufficient firmness of his own, and sufficient support from others, not
merely to carry the Bill, for that is little, but to work it according
to the recommendations of the School Inquiry Commissioners.11 I honour
Dr Temple12 and Acland13 for producing so good a report, for I have no
doubt it is mainly their doing.

TO JOHN ELLIOT CAIRNES1

Blackheath Park

April 9, 1869

Dear Mr Cairnes

First and foremost let me express the great pleasure it gives me to hear
of the progressive improvement in your health. Seeing how well the dry
and stimulating climate of Nice seems to have agreed with you, and that
it has not disagreed with Mrs Cairnes, I confess to some misgiving as to
the prudence of your passing next winter in the damp and depressing
climate of this island, which is dampest and cloudiest when it is
mildest. But you, and your medical adviser, are better judges than I can
be.

With regard to the “Analysis”,2 for which you thank me so warmly, I know
no one on whom it is better bestowed, nor any one to whom it was a
greater pleasure to offer it. I shall have another book to offer you
very soon; a volume of about the size of the “Liberty”, on the
“Subjection of Women.” It is not specially on the Suffrage question, but
on all the questions relating to women’s domestic subordination and
social disabilities, all of which it discusses more fully than has been
done hitherto. I think it will be useful, and all the more, as it is
sure to be very bitterly attacked.

I am on the point of sending to the Fortnightly the first part of a
review of Thornton’s book;3 the purely economical part. I shall be very
desirous of knowing whether you agree with my judgment of the book from
the purely scientific point of view. I feel pretty sure you will concur
in what I have written on the so-called wages fund, a subject on which I
expressed myself in my Political Economy as inaccurately as other
people, and which I have only within the last two or three years seen in
its proper light. On the other subject on which you think Thornton
vulnerable, the losing sight of the population principle, it would have
been better, perhaps, if he had added a few pages on the relation of
that question to his doctrine; but I have no idea that he has changed
any of the opinions which are so strongly expressed in his former
Edition: current; Page: [1588] writings on that subject.4 Most of the
notices of his book have been just what you describe: but there have
been two lately, which probably you had not yet seen—a most crabbed and
cantankerous one in the Spectator,5 and a very friendly and generous one
(apparently by Mr Hill) in the Daily News.6 It is very amusing in this
and other cases to see how the tyros in Political Economy think
themselves bound to give no quarter to heresies, being afraid to make
any of the concessions which their masters make.

With regard to Gladstone’s bill, it was at first a disappointment to
find that nothing better was to be done with the Church property than
what is proposed.7 But I do not know how to complain; for the only
better use to which the funds could be put is Education, and it was
hardly to be desired that the Government should force on the fierce
quarrel about Irish Education with the Church question still unsettled.8
Besides the probability that to do so might have compromised the passing
of the measure it would, even when carried, have no longer been of any
efficacy in allaying Irish discontent, unless, indeed, a complete
surrender had been made of education to the priests. At present, this
bill, at least, has been made completely satisfactory to Catholic
feeling, and it will be all the more practicable to fight the education
question hereafter—when there is some hope that English elementary
education may first have been settled, on something like an
undenominational basis.

Another reason against throwing any avoidable difficulty in the way of
Church disendowment, is that its completion will open the way for the
land question. It has been for some time apparent that when the
religious supremacy of Protestantism is at an end, the Presbyterians of
the North, and even many Orangemen, will join hands with the tenantry of
the South on the land question, and the junction is coming to pass, even
more quickly than could have been expected. The motion brought forward
by Johnstone9 and seconded by the O’Donoghue for the repeal of the Party
Processions Act, is a very significant incident.

Edition: current; Page: [1589]
I agree with you that the tithe rent charge is a very good tax; but it
could not have been taken for state purposes, and it would have been a
very inconvenient property to be held by Commissioners for the
management of Hospitals, &c.

I look forward with great pleasure to seeing you but not at Blackheath
in May, for it would be making little use of our recovered liberty not
to spend in the South, for the first time since 1865, the beautiful
spring months. We leave for Avignon next Tuesday, and expect to be back

Dear Mr Rae

I have not seen Mr McLean’s pamphlet,2 nor have I any pamphlets or other
works expressing the Protectionist doctrines held in Canada or
Australia. I have only seen these doctrines put forth in newspapers
which I have not kept. But there is a very good summary in Mr Dilke’s
“Greater Britain”3 of the arguments which he himself heard used in the
Colonies, particularly in Australia, and which he considers to be those
which are mainly influential with the supporters of Protectionism there.

The pseudo-scientific arguments for Protection are given at wearisome
length in H. C. Carey’s “Social Science”,4 which, take it for all in
all, I consider to be about the worst book on political economy I ever
read: an opinion which I was amply prepared to justify immediately after
toiling through it. This book gives Protectionism the prestige of
scientific authority in the United States, but its elaborate reasonings
are not likely to be those Edition: current; Page: [1590] which carry
conviction to the multitude. I take it that the popular argument is, as
stated to me by Mr Wells,5 and in the Essay by Dr Leavitt6 to which the
Cobden Club has given its medal—that if American labourers are compelled
to compete with the pauper labour of Europe, they also will be reduced
to pauperism. The fallacy is plausible, and a good many of the English
freetraders would be puzzled to give it a satisfactory answer. If you
can make the answer such as the general reader will understand, you will
do a very valuable work.

Je n’étais pas à St. Véran lorsque votre lettre du 30 mars y est

que vous m’avez adressé: Du reste, l’association2 n’avait pas besoin de
mon vote. Le choix du personnel doit ordinairement rester à ceux qui
prennent une part active aux travaux. Quant à moi, je suis un membre
très inutile de l’Association, bien que vivement intéressé à son but.

Si je reste quelquefois longtemps sans donner de mes nouvelles à un
ancien ami comme vous, il ne faut l’attribuer qu’au manque de loisir. Je
reçois, pour mon malheur, un très grand nombre de lettres, dont beaucoup
ont besoin Edition: current; Page: [1592] d’une réponse, et même d’une
réponse réfléchie et soignée, portant sur des choses publiques ou
privées où je suis personellement désintéressé; et lorsque j’ai, à grand
peine, distrait de mes occupations le temps nécessaire pour remplir ce
devoir, il ne me reste, en général ni le temps ni l’énergie d’écrire à
mes propres amis à moins d’une nécessité pressante. J’ai donc à les
prier d’user de l’indulgence envers moi, et de ne me conserver pas moins
leurs bon sentiments.

Je vous envoie un mandat de poste pour la souscription annuelle. Si je
la dois plus d’une année, je vous prie de vouloir bien m’en avertir.
J’ai lu tous vos articles dans le Temps,3 et je vous félicite du progrès
de l’Association. Je voudrais bien pouvoir féliciter également la Grèce
sous le rapport politique; mais l’insurrection Crétoise,4 qui semblait
lui promettre des avantages précieux, n’a servi que de leurre, et a
seulement laissé les Grecs encore plus dénués qu’auparavant des
ressources nécessaires pour le bon gouvernement de leur pays. Je n’ai
pas besoin de dire que toutes mes sympathies sont avec eux; mais dans
l’état présent de l’Europe, la Grèce n’a pas d’autres chances
d’agrandissement qu’en travaillant à la prospérité intérieure.
Contrairement à une opinion malheureusement très répandue, je crois les
Grecs très dignes et très capables d’un gouvernement libre. Mais ils
souffrent du fléau de toutes les nations dont les citoyens n’ont pas
l’habitude ou le loisir de s’occuper de la chose publique, sans
remission. Ils laissent les affaires nationales à des hommes qui
pratiquent la politique comme un métier pour vivre, et qui partout, même
aux Etats-Unis, s’ils ne sont pas contenus par une opinion publique
forte et prononcée. conduisent les affaires dans le sens de leur propre
intérêt pécuniaire. Je ne vois à cela de remède permanent que dans une
grande prospérité matérielle, qui permettrait à un nombre considérable
d’hommes intelligents de mener une certaine attention aux intérêts
publics de front avec leurs propres affaires. Ajoutez à cela les bonnes
voies de communications qui permettraient une combinaison plus facile
entre des efforts aujourd’hui isolés, et la Grèce ne serait plus
exploitée comme elle l’est aujourd’hui par des place-hunters.

On the day of our arrival here, I received your kind note. I will have
your copy of the book2 sent, as soon as it is published, to the address
you mention.

I cannot feel very positive in my opinion as to the questions of policy
connected with the proposed disposal of the Church property, especially
as you do not agree with me.3 But my impression has been, all along,
that it would have been extremely difficult to pass a bill for
disendowment through even the House of Commons, without deciding, in the
Bill itself, what should be the application of the funds. People are
very suspicious in Church matters, and a large proportion of the warmest
supporters of disendowment would have suspected the Government of
meditating some employment of the money which they did not yet dare
disclose; probably, to give it, in some form, to the Catholic clergy.

If, in your journey to Aix, your way lies through Avignon, I hope you
will give us an opportunity of snatching a sight of you as you pass. If
so, perhaps you will kindly write me a line a few days before the time
when we may expect you, so that we may not be absent on an excursion
exactly at the time. We do not intend to make any long journey this

But we shall always be returning here for our letters, &c and resting in

Dear Madam—

You have done me the honor to inform me of the Convention about to be

a letter on the occasion. I would gladly comply with the request, but
the cause, in America, has advanced beyond the stage at which it could
need a recommendation from me, or from any man. It is not to be believed
that the nation which is now engaged in admitting the newly-liberated
negro to the plenitude of all political franchises, will much longer
retain women in a state of helotage which (as is truly remarked in the
letter of invitation issued by your Association) is now more degrading
than ever, because, being no longer shared by any of the male sex, it
constitutes every woman the inferior of every man. The late glorious
struggle has shaken old prejudices, and has brought men to a feeling
that the principles of your democratic institutions are not mere
phrases, but are meant to be believed and acted upon towards all
persons; and I am persuaded that the political equality which is now
refused to no one else, will be conceded to women as soon as a
sufficiently large number of them unite in demanding it. I therefore
heartily wish success to the approaching demonstration.

I am, dear madam, very sincerely yours,

strengthening Edition: current; Page: [1595] their position. So small a
number of life members would do little good even if they were always
honestly selected, which they will not be. A few good names may be put
in at first, but, as a rule, the life peerage will be a refuge for the
mediocrities of past administrations. If now and then a thoughtful and
vigorous man gets in, he will, no doubt, have the means of publicly
speaking his thoughts, but to an inattentive audience; for the Peers are
too stupid and too conservative to be moved, except by a party leader
who they think will carry distinctions to the utmost limits of
practicability; and the public pay little attention to speeches in the
House of Lords. I doubt if a Second Chamber can ever again carry weight
in English politics, unless popularly elected. I feel sure, at all
events that nothing less than what I proposed in my book on
Representative Government,3 will enable it to do so. These are my
opinions; but I do not wish to throw cold water on anything which
acknowledges an evil, and points in the direction of improvement.

I should not at all wonder if Gladstone in what he said to you, did hint
at a life peerage: though perhaps what he meant was, to hold out hopes
that you might be supported by the Government in a future candidature
for the House of Commons. I should be more glad if it were the last; but
I do not mean that I should advise you to refuse the former, for as it
would be obviously a tribute to your legislative capacity, it would
doubtless increase your weight. Ever yrs truly

Dear Sir—

Your letter has followed me here, & I have read it with great interest.
As a piece of English composition it is quite remarkable as the
production of a foreigner; & I agree in a great part of its substance.
Mr Lowe has certainly much exaggerated the strength of the case against
the shilling duty on corn.2 I however differ from you on one of the
leading points of your Edition: current; Page: [1596] argument, viz.
where you aim at proving that the price of corn would not fall by the
whole amount of the duty taken off, but by a smaller amount, dependent
on the degree in which the importation of corn may be increased by the
abolition of the duty. This argument was urged formerly during the
discussions which preceded the repeal of our corn laws3 & I had occasion
to contest it at that time. It seems to me that your argument errs by
stopping short at demand & supply as the final regulators of price,
without going on to that which in the last resort, adjusts the demand &
supply to one another, viz. Costs of production (including all cost
necessary for bringing the article to the place of sale). If from any
permanent natural calamity smiting the soil with sterility the cost of
production of wheat were increased by a shilling a quarter, I apprehend
that the price of wheat would rise by that amount, plus the ordinary
profit upon it, even if there were no diminution of supply. Whether the
supply would be finally diminished or not would depend on whether the
rise of price caused a falling off in the consumption. But the
conditions of production having been altered, the average price (that
which the producer looks forward to & calculates upon) must accommodate
itself to the new conditions. And the same thing happens if instead of a
natural calamity, we suppose the artificial burthen of a tax, which
though levied only on a part of the corn consumed, enables all the
remainder to command on the average the higher price necessary for
bringing in that part: Supply & demand determine the perturbations of
price; but (when the article admits of unlimited increase) not the
permanent, or average, price.

I think, therefore, your argument fails in one important point; & though
some of your other arguments remain valid notwithstanding, I do not
think them sufficient to outweigh the advantage of getting rid of the
last remaining shred of Protectionism.

But I do not therefore dissuade you from publishing your paper.4 It is
written in a way to command attention, & so many intelligent persons
will think your opinion correct & mine erroneous, that it is right that
the opinion shd have a fair hearing. The only newspapers however which
would be very likely to insert such a paper would be the Conservative
journals, Standard, Herald, &c. & with them I have no relations.
Probably it would have a better chance either with them or with the
Times if sent by yourself.

Je serai heureux d’être de quelqu’utilité à votre fils.2 Je puis lui
donner des recommandations à quelques familles de Manchester,
entr’autres à M. Bazley,3 député de Manchester, à M. Potter,4 qui a
succédé à Cobden comme député de Rochdale, et une ou deux autres. Les
enverrai-je directement à son adresse (chez Bryan Peacock et Cie?) ou à
vous-même à Paris?

En effet, je suis avec le plus grand intérêt le mouvement électoral du
moment.5 Ce serait trop de bonheur s’il pouvait aboutir comme celui
auquel vous le comparez, à un changement de majorité. Mais on ne peut
pas espérer autant. Ce serait déjà beaucoup qu’un notable accroissement
dans le nombre de l’Opposition.

Qu’une revolution soit désormais possible ou non, la plupart de la
classe aisée paraît encore la craindre beaucoup, et je crois qu’une
partie de la classe ouvrière, même dans le midi, l’espère toujours. Des
hommes intelligents d’ici pensent que la tendance plus libérale qui se
montre parmi la classe moyenne a surtout pour cause la crainte que le
systême du gouvernement actuel ne pousse à une catastrophe, et qu’au
lendemain d’un triomphe libéral les mêmes hommes redeviendraient
conservateurs. On se plaint aussi que les hommes d’opposition qui
reparaissent sur la scène politique sont pour la plupart des démocrates
autoritaires de l’école de la Convention, et non des hommes de la

TO A. M. FRANCIS1

Avignon

May 8. 1869

Dear Sir—

I have received your letter & I will answer its different points
seriatim.

1. My letter to Mr. Holden2 has been much misunderstood if it is
supposed to indicate any change in my opinions on the sphere & functions
of Government in the economical affairs of societies. The only opinion I
intended to withdraw was that which recommended, in certain cases,
temporary protective duties in new countries to aid the experimental
introduction of new industries. And even on this point I continue to
think that my opinion was well grounded but experience has shewn that
protectionism, once introduced, is in danger of perpetuating itself
through the private interests it enlists in its favour, & I therefore
now prefer some other mode of public aid to new industries, though in
itself less appropriate.

I quite agree with you that in Australia there are many important
requisites of prosperity which the Govt ought not to consider it beyond
its province to provide. One of these is the one you mention—works of
irrigation. I have long looked forward to the time when Australia would
feel the need of tanks like those of Southern India,3 to retain through
the dry season the surplus rains of the few rainy months. This however
is a work on a great scale requiring combined labour & therefore
difficult to accomplish with your present population.

I took no part in the discussion about the purchase of the Telegraphs4
because it was a mere experiment of which I do not foresee the result. I
shd object to the purchase of the railways until the smaller measure
shall have approved its policy by its success. And in no case does it
seem to me admissible that the Govt should work the railways. If it
became proprietor of them it ought to lease them to private companies.

2. With regard to lands I am still, like yourself, in favour of the
Wakefield system.5 I should however highly approve of selling the lands
subject to a Edition: current; Page: [1599] land tax, if the Govt is in
a condition to enforce its payment without a cost exceeding the worth; a
difficulty which seemed fatal to this plan at the time when Wakefield
wrote.

3. On the importation of Polynesian labourers6 I am afraid we differ
more widely. If the South Sea islanders came to Queensland
spontaneously, the province would have every reason to welcome their
coming. But I have the most deep rooted distrust of plans for sending
emissaries to induce them to come, even by no worse means than brilliant
representations. And I do not believe that any laws, which it is
possible to enforce among an English population, will protect ignorant &
uncivilised strangers living with them as servants, against outrageous
abuses of power. If the experiment ever answers it is probably with
Chinese, who are a more fearless & vigorous race & are able to make
themselves very unpleasant to those who ill treat them. But the common
English abroad—I do not know if in this they are worse than other
people—are intensely contemptuous of what they consider inferior races,
& seldom willingly practise any other mode of attaining their ends with
them than bullying & blows. I therefore most positively object to
putting such victims in their power. If there are no other means of
preventing labour from being over scanty, then I am afraid the
inconveniences of the climate must be taken with its advantages. But I
shd think that the agricultural population of England & Ireland would
furnish (agreeably to one of Wakefield’s principles) a sufficient number
of young married couples to supply in a moderate number of years the
labour required.

If in the expression of these opinions I have been rather brief &
abrupt, I beg that you will attribute it to my occupations & to the
haste with which they oblige me to write.

TO T. E. CLIFFE LESLIE1

A[vignon]

May 8, 1869

Dear Mr Leslie—

You should not take the editors & their ways so much au sérieux.2 You
must remember that your writings are intended for the Edition: current;
Page: [1600] public good, & that the editors are not half such good
judges of that as you are. Consequently it is for you to make them take
your articles just as you would make them take medicine, without any
amour propre at having made it up for them yourself, & so put in a
little sugar now & then if need be. Now, having made a real success with
your amusing as well as useful articles of travels,3 the editors ask you
for more of the same, & you should give it them, wrapping up good
doctrine in this form. You should be no more on your dignity with them
than with children. To a man like yourself most of them are children, as
regards their motives & the objects they have in view. Morley indeed is
better, but I dare say he is a good deal bothered & he probably thinks
that Chauffard’s Mittermaier is a subject that can wait better than
most.4 I should be vexed if the paper that you wrote to oblige me should
have any unpleasant effect on your relations with him.

I agree with you in exceedingly disliking the insolent & domineering
affectations of Fitzjames Stephen. In pol. economy he is exceedingly
ignorant, but not the less presumptuous. On other matters, however, he
is able to do some useful work, & he is undoubtedly a clever man. My
daughter begins to have some doubts whether he is thoroughly an honest
man, either in word or deed. It is certain that he says & does oddly
inconsistent things. He is always brutal, even at his best; that however
is apparently in him a radical defect of temperament, which if he is
otherwise an honest worker for good, might have to be overlooked. It is
certain that he is very vain, & that may be the cause of many of his
defects in which vanity is not apparent, as of the boyish boast that he
always goes to sleep at the P.E. Club.5 Has he then so much time to
spare; or does he mean that he comes because he cannot get sleep
elsewhere? But he is full of this sort of fanfaronnade, which is
offensive enough, but which we may excuse if he is in earnest about
anything. One cannot help hoping he is because he is clever enough to do
a good deal of good or of mischief.

I shall read with great interest your paper on profits.6 If it is not in
print before I return to England, perhaps you would not mind letting me
see it in MS. I am open to conviction, but at present I cannot see that
you are likely to be successful in anything more than in shewing that
the doctrine respecting value & cost of production is true within wider
limits of error—is true much more roughly & only in the gross, than is
often supposed by political economists. This I am quite prepared to
admit.

Edition: current; Page: [1601]
I am very happy on all accounts that you have been appointed to the
Examinership7—& on my own account that you are likely to bring on your
question at the Club in July8 for I count upon being present at that
meeting. I read & was glad of M. de Laveleye’s letter in the Economist.9
The prospect of an account of Servia & Bosnia from so good an observer &
thinker is very agreeable.10

Sumner’s speech11 if serious is almost frantic. Probably however (& that
is unpleasant enough) what it means is a wish not to settle the Alabama
question at all but to keep the wound unhealed. One does not know what
to say or do until it appears whether this is a passing gust or a
permanent mood of the American mind. Perhaps it is but a reaction from
Reverdy Johnson’s ill-advised & ill-timed soft sawder.12

We saw Cairnes on his way through Avignon to Aix les Bains, & you will
be glad to hear how wonderfully he has improved in health. He can now
walk for a short time, without even a stick, on level ground, & for the
first time speaks as if he had some hopes of being restored to active
life.

I do not understand Lord Dufferin.13 Why shd he wish to receive from me
a production of which he thinks so unfavourably that my sending it to
him of my own accord would have been almost a piece of bravado? A
compliment of the sort he seems to desire from me is only suitable
towards a fellow worker in the same cause, or a private friend, & Lord
D. is neither: but as I shd be sorry to refuse any request of the sort
from you, I will do what you asked if you wish it, on the ground that
Lord D. is a friend of yours.

Dear Graham

I will with great pleasure be your surety for the additional £1000.

It does seem as if this time a Bankruptcy Bill will really pass,2 and
those personally interested will be no longer kept in uncertainty
concerning their future. I greatly doubt the expediency of the change,
as far as relates to the abolition of your office:3 but apparently the
mercantile men will have it so. In other respects this bill seems a
little better than the very bad ones we have had lately, but still very
different from what it ought to be.

If the bill passes, you will have more time for the subjects in which
you were so deeply interested in our younger days,4 and in which I have
always thought that the engrossing and anxious nature of your daily
occupations has cost to the world very valuable contributions. I have
myself been greatly indebted to those searching discussions, at Mr
Grote’s house in Sun Court,5 of some of which the “Analysis” itself was
the text, and to the value of which no one contributed more, if anybody
so much, as yourself.

I had long had the project of publishing an annotated edition of the
Analysis; and now when Bain’s treatises and the progress of physiology
have raised up a certain public, disposed to listen to the Association
view of Psychology, the republication will probably place the book in
its deserved position as a text book of that view of the science.

Dear Sir

I thank you for your letter, as I am always glad to have my opinions and
arguments subjected to the criticisms of any one who has studied the
subject. Edition: current; Page: [1603] It appears to me, however, that
your remarks do not touch the scientific exactness of the propositions
laid down in my article in the Fortnightly Review, but only the
practical importance of the cases to which they are applicable. Now,
though I am far from agreeing with you as to this, I have not discussed
it in the article. My object, on this occasion, was to show that the
door is not shut on the subject by the insuperable law of nature.

It is one thing to say that labourers, by combination, cannot raise
wages (which is the doctrine of many political economists), and another
to say that it is not for their interest to force up wages so high as to
reduce profits below what is a sufficient inducement to saving and to
the increase of capital.

I have written a second article on the subject, which will be printed in
the next number of the Fortnightly, and which, though it will not
satisfy you on all points, will, I think, show you that I do not
disregard either the moral or the prudential obligations of trades’
unions.

O’Sullivan’s resignation has saved the country from a most mischievous
infringement of the commonest principles of good government—an act of
Parlt against an individual.4 Arbitrary power is arbitrary power whether
exercised in legislative forms by a Parlt or in administrative forms by
a king & it is precisely in the case of persons with whom hardly any
body sympathises (or dares to admit that he sympathises) that fatal
precedents creep in. It is a permanent blot on the conduct of the

would be the ready answer that after all you were violating the law

Dear Sir—

I have read your letter of the 18th with attention & interest & I am
much inclined to think with you that the effect of so small a duty as
one shilling a quarter on wheat is not sufficient to make it certain
that any perceptible relief will be obtained by taking it off. Still, we
must reason about small effects on the same principle as one does on
large ones. The duty gives a premium of a shilling in cost of production
to home grown corn over imported. This must naturally cause a certain
quantity more to be grown at home & a certain quantity less to be
imported & every additional quantity grown at home in a given state of
agriculture is grown at a proportionally greater cost. The average price
therefore must rise sufficiently to remunerate this greater cost; but it
will not rise by the full amount of the duty; otherwise it would not
have the effect of reducing the quantity imported. Thus the average
price of corn will, I conceive, be raised by an uncertain amount short
of one shilling a quarter. But this increased price the consumer has to
pay on all corn, home grown as well as imported, and from this he will
be relieved by taking off the duty.

The sacrifice even of mere time, by one who is otherwise so fully

Dear Mr Taylor—

I have reconsidered the letter to Chesson2 with reference to your
remarks on it; but I do not see any ready means of freeing it from the
character you point out without making it less expressive of the
sentiments which the Committee wish to put on record. On the whole I
think it is hardly if at all a defect that the official letter should be
written as if the recipient had no previous knowledge of what is
intended. Anything which is taken for granted is of course not
expressed; & its expression is so much abated from the complimentary
matter which the recipient would naturally like to retain in a permanent
form.

As, therefore, you did not suggest any particular alteration, I have
made none but merely return the letter, copied fair with my signature;
but if you would like any alteration it is not too late to make it.

Edition: current; Page: [1608]
I cannot but think that the dropping of the bill against O’Sullivan3 has
saved the British democracy from a most perilous snare. It seems to me
that the distinction between a government by general laws & one of
arbitrary edicts is the broadest in all politics, & absolutely essential
to good government under any constitution: for the reason long assigned
by Aristotle,4 that government by law is guided by general
considerations of permanent policy while government by special decree is
guided by the passion of the moment. And it is most especially necessary
that this distinction should not be tampered with in a popular
government, for most other governments are under some check from fear of
the majority; but when the majority is itself the government, the check
is only in its own breast, & depends on a strong conviction in the
popular mind of its necessity which conviction is enfeebled by every
instance of violation. I think it would be a fatal notion to get abroad
among the people of a democratic country that laws or constitutions may
be stepped over instead of being altered; in other words that an object
immediately desirable may be grasped directly in a particular case
without the salutary previous process of considering whether the
principle acted on is one which the nation would bear to adopt as a rule
for general guidance. I have always admired Lincoln, among other
reasons, because even for so great an end as the abolition of slavery he
did not set aside the Constitution5 but waited till he could bring what
he wanted to do (by a little straining perhaps) within the license
allowed by the Constitution for military necessities.

Cher Monsieur—

Je crois en effet que quelques pages préliminaires à la traduction de
l’Assujettissement des Femmes2 seraient très utiles et je trouve les
vôtres excellentes. Je vous soumettrai cependant deux ou trois
observations.

1. D’abord il me semble que vous ne rendez pas pleine justice aux St
Simoniens et aux Fourieristes, que vous désignez clairement sans les
nommer. Je condamne comme vous beaucoup de leurs doctrines et surtout le
gouvernementalisme à outrance des St Simoniens. Cependant je trouve que
les uns et les autres ont rendu de grands services: et notamment sur la
question des femmes, le St Simonisme surtout ayant jeté dans les hautes
régions de la vie intellectuelle et pratique, un grand nombre d’esprits
supérieurs, désabusés aujourd’hui de ce qu’il y avait de faux ou
d’exagéré dans leurs systèmes mais conservant ce qu’ils avaient de bon y
compris l’égalité des femmes. Les St Simoniens d’ailleurs avaient le bon
esprit de déclarer toujours qu’on ne peut prononcer sur la fonction des
femmes sans elles et que la loi qui les doit régir ne peut être donnée
que par des femmes ou par une femme. Ils n’ont donné leurs propres idées
sur ce sujet que comme des hypothèses. Il est vrai que, comme il arrive
le plus souvent, on leur a tenu très peu compte de cette réserve.

2. D’un autre côté tout en traitant Proudhon avec une juste sévérité
vous Edition: current; Page: [1610] me semblez lui avoir fait la part
trop belle en disant qu’il a rendu de grands services à la course du
progrès. Je puis me tromper, mais il m’a toujours semblé que Proudhon a
été très nuisible à la cause du progrès. D’abord personne n’a tant fait
pour provoquer la réaction de la peur, qui a eu et qui a encore des
effets si funestes. Ensuite je ne vois dans ses écrits rien de
foncièrement juste et progressif. Ce qu’il y a chez lui de plus puissant
c’est sa dialectique subversive, mais c’est une dialectique d’un mauvais
aller; une vraie sophistique, car elle s’attaque au bien comme au mal,
et au lieu de se contenter de dire ce qui peut se dire avec vérité
contre la meilleure cause, elle entasse contre chaque côté de la
question pêle-mêle avec les bonnes raisons, tous les sophismes et même
les calomnies qu’on a jamais débités de part et d’autre. Cela brouille
les esprits et fausse les idées, tandis que la bonne dialectique les
éclairait.

3. Tout ce que vous avez écrit à l’endroit de Lanfrey3 est parfaitement
bien pensé et dit. Seulement il me paraît douteux si nous faisons
prudemment de rompre en visière avec lui. C’est un homme qu’on peut
toujours espérer de ramener aux idées vraies, et si on s’attaque aux
gens on risque d’intéresser leur amour-propre à persister dans la voie
qu’ils ont une fois prise.

4. Je voudrais qu’il fût vrai qu’en Angleterre les esprits eussent été
déjà préparés en 1851 à la discussion de l’émancipation des femmes, et
que le temps où l’on pouvait s’en tirer par le ridicule était déjà
passé. Cela est vrai aujourd’hui, mais ne l’était pas alors. La
discussion n’a été réellement entamée en A[ngleterre] que dans cette
année-là, par l’article de ma femme que vous avez lu dans le 2me vol des
Dissertations.4

Il y a à la page 6 une expression qu’il serait peut-être bien de
modifier: c’est là où vous dites “Il ne s’agit plus de changer les
relations sociales des sexes.” Je sais bien ce que vous avez voulu dire,
mais ce qui est proposé dans mon petit livre serait certainement regardé
comme un grand changement dans les relations sociales des sexes.

Je ne connais “The Jesus of History”2 que par l’annonce. Depuis quelque
temps on s’occupe beaucoup en Angleterre comme ailleurs de la critique
Edition: current; Page: [1611] historique de la Bible, et les idées
rationnelles sur ce sujet y sont en grand progrès. Il est très heureux
que votre livre des Evangiles3 y soit connu de ceux qui s’occupent de
ces questions, sur lesquelles il a tant répandu de lumière.

Le livre assez mal nommé “Eléments de Science Sociale” est, je crois,
d’un certain Docteur Drysdale. Il y a deux Docteurs en Médicine de ce
nom, frères (je crois) et partageant les mêmes opinions. Celui-ci, à ce
que je pense, doit être le Dr. Charles Drysdale.4 Sans avoir lu tout le
livre, j’en pris un peu connaissance à l’époque de sa première
publication. J’y trouvai d’excellentes choses, avec quelques autres qui
ne me plaisaient pas. Je crois l’auteur, au reste, un homme éclairé, et
très zélé pour la plupart des bonnes causes.

Les élections ont bien répondu à vos prédictions.5 C’est l’indice d’un
immense progrès; mais il eût été à désirer que le parti démocratique par
excellence se fût mieux entendu avec ceux qui mènent la liberté de front
avec la démocratie. Il est fâcheux que Jules Favre risque de n’être élu
nulle part, et qu’un homme comme Carnot6 soit rejeté.

M. Lavasseur me fit l’honneur de m’envoyer son livre.7 Ce que j’en ai eu
le temps de lire indique que c’est un très bon ouvrage d’enseignement
populaire.

Je sais que ni vous ni votre frère ne prenez le titre de baron, mais je
crois que lui au moins, et probablement vous, y avez droit. C’est la
première fois que j’en affaibli l’un ou l’autre,8 mais vous savez qu’il
y a de nos gros industriels anglais qui ont une admiration sincère pour
un titre, et que pour ceux-là un homme estimable est rehaussé par la
possession d’un titre, comme aux yeux de presque tous les Français une
femme d’esprit l’est par la beauté.

Dear Bain—

Mr Veitch sent me a copy of the Life of Hamilton.2 His replies to my
strictures are so very weak (Mansel & water, with an infusion of
vinegar) Edition: current; Page: [1613] that I shall hardly [feel] any
need of giving them the distinction of a special notice; except that I
am bound to admit that the passage of Aristotle which H. seemed to have
misunderstood,3 was not indicated by any reference of his own, but of
the editors. That is quite sufficient for my purpose; since Mansel at
least has learning, & that passage of Aristotle was I suppose, the
nearest he could find to bearing out what Hamilton said. But after all
H. must have known what A. meant by ἐνεργεια.4 I agree with you as to
the general impression which the book gives of Hamilton.5 Only as it
shews advantageously a side of his character which I had no knowledge
of, that of his private affections, the general result rather raised him
in my eyes.

I [am] glad to be confirmed by you in my impression that nothing in my
notes to the Analysis, on the question of Belief,6 is incompatible with
your theory of it. I shall be very glad to see your last views of the
subject more fully developed. Cairnes, who had not previously studied
psychology very seriously but who has now been reading both the Analysis
& our notes with full appreciation & great edification, seems to feel a
need of some further explanations on the doctrine of Belief as connected
with the Will,7 & what a man of his practised intelligence wants is
likely to be wanted by most others. As far as we two are concerned, it
is very unlikely that any difference of opinion shd develop itself when
your doctrine is explicitly worked out.

I hope the new book8 reached you early. Longman is wanting to print a
second edition.

The Lords have done all the mischief they could to the Scotch Education
Bill.9 One would have thought the unanimous recommendations of a
Commission, partly Tory & fairly representative of all sections in
Scotland, might have passed their ordeal. But they will no doubt as you
say, revenge themselves for having to eat their leek (if they do eat it)
in the Church question10 by spoiling other Bills. They are becoming a
very irritating kind of minor nuisance.

Dear Mr Spencer

I fully agree with you that in a great many cases women tyrannize over
men, and you will find that I have not omitted to notice this in the
little book I sent you,2 nor to notice the fact that it is generally the
best men who get the worst tyrannized over. But in this case as in a
great many others, two negatives do not make an affirmative, or at all
events two affirmatives do not make a negative and two contradictory
tyrannies do not make liberty. In the first place the illegitimate power
of women is greater than it would be if they had legitimate freedom. The
consciousness of their weakness makes the most generous men shrink from
exacting justice from them: while the fact that women have to submit to
injustice through the whole of their lives, dulls in them the sense of
justice when circumstances put it in their power to be the arbiters of
justice towards others. Moreover, the more decidedly we think Edition:
current; Page: [1615] that women are already a great power in
society—and no one is more strongly of that opinion than I am—the more
important it becomes that they should be fit to exercise it properly.
All the mischievous sources of women’s power are exaggerated by our
morbid habit of dwelling upon sex as deciding their whole destiny in
life: and this same system makes both the motives and the methods of
women’s influence morbid and demoralizing in their turn. I shall hope to
have some opportunities of talking over this and other matters with you,
if you are in town in the summer, and can spare us an afternoon now and

Dear Mr Cairnes

I have had so much to do, and so many other letters to write, that I
have delayed till now thanking you for your most acceptable letter of
May 23, and especially for the sifting which you have given to my review
of Thornton.2 You may imagine how gratifying it is to me that you give
so complete an adhesion to the view I take of the wages fund. In regard
to the general subject of demand and supply, I think there is not, at
bottom, any considerable difference between us. My object in the
Fortnightly was to shew that the cases supposed by Thornton do not
contradict and invalidate, as he thinks they do, the equation of supply
and demand. In this you agree with me, and you do not think the doctrine
incorrect. The amount of its value, either scientific or practical, is a
different question. But, while I admit almost all that you say, I think
that the proposition as laid down is something more than an identical
proposition. It does not define, nor did it, as I stated it, affect to
define the causes of variations in value. But it declares the condition
of all such variations, and the necessary modus operandi of their
causes, viz. that they operate by moving the supply to equality with the
demand, or the demand to equality with the supply. The numerous
considerations which you notice as influencing the minds of sellers,
are, all of them, considerations of probable future demand and supply,
modifying the effect which would take place if nothing but present facts
were considered. Now it appears to me important to point out that these
prospective considerations operate by inducing the sellers either to
Edition: current; Page: [1617] convert a possible present supply into an
actual one, or to withdraw an actual present supply into the region of
merely possible ones; and that in either case the relation of the price
to the actual supply and demand is constant, i.e. the price is that
which will make them equal. If this statement does no more than give a
distinct scientific expression to what is already implied in the terms
used, still it is not unimportant to evolve and make explicit what the
facts of purchase and sale and a market price really involve.

I am delighted that you have derived so much pleasure and advantage from
the Analysis. That alone is enough to satisfy me of the great good
likely to be done by its republication. With regard to the difficulties
you have found in some of Bain’s notes,3 he is aware that his doctrines
respecting Belief and Volition require further explanations and
developments. I am myself not always sure that I am able to follow him
in every detail, though I do not think that any of my views clash with
his. I am, however, inclined to agree in what I think is his opinion,
that volition is not a name for a peculiar state of feeling or
phenomenon of mind, but only a name for the immediate and irresistible
sequence between the specific action of the efferent nerve fibres and
the internal cause which produces it, and which is either an idea, a
desire, or (as explained for the first time by Bain) the spontaneous
activity of the nervous system under the stimulus of nutriment.

Pray thank Mrs Cairnes very warmly for her kind letter. I hope to be
able to talk over with her and you any remaining difficulties she may
feel.4 I wish the opportunity were nearer than it is likely to be, for
Penzance and Blackheath are very far apart.5 But if Penzance aids your
restoration to health, I shall be very grateful to it. We were happy to
hear good accounts of you from those who saw you in your passage through
London.

Dear Mr Norton

Few things could be more pleasant or more encouraging to me than such a
letter as yours. It is a great satisfaction that you not only agree so
completely with the little book,2 but think so highly as you do of its
probable influence. It is quite true that it was written principally
with a view to the state of society and opinion in England; and even
with respect to that, it bears traces of having been written, as it was,
several years ago. I am aware that the circumstances of the United
States are, for the reasons you give, decidedly more favourable than
those of the old country. Accordingly, the movement commenced in
America, and is much more advanced there than in England though it is
advancing very rapidly in England too. It will probably be some time
before a Committee of the House of Commons will recommend the admission
of women to the parliamentary suffrage; but the repeal of the legal
provision which excluded women from the municipal franchise, has just
passed the House of Commons unopposed.3 The present session will also
see (unless the Lords stop it) the right of married women to their own
property and earnings acknowledged,4 and placed on the same footing in
England as in most of the States of the Union. We live in times when
broad principles of justice, perseveringly proclaimed, end by carrying
the world with them. Your great anti-slavery contest has done that much
for mankind. How little did the cotemporaries of the voyage of the
Mayflower suspect what was to come of it!

America will probably also be the first to resolve the complicated
question of marriage and divorce. It cannot be resolved until women have
an equal voice in deciding it.

If we were going to stay here, we should not envy you even your

B[lackheath] P[ark]

July 14. 1869

Dear Bain—

I am very glad that you are so well pleased with the new book.2 With
regard to the single point on which you are doubtful,3 my defence is
this. The policy of not laying down wider premises than are required to
support the practical conclusion immediately aimed at, was a wise policy
ten years ago. It was the right policy until the women’s suffrage
question had acquired such a footing in practical politics as to leave
little danger of its being thrown back. But the question has now entered
into a new & more advanced stage. The objection with which we are now
principally met is that women are not fit for, or not capable of, this,
that or the other mental achievement. And though it is a perfectly good
answer to say that if this be a fact, things will adjust themselves to
it under free competition, & also that without free competition we
cannot know whether it is a fact or not, many will ask, & many more will
feel, “Why make a great change & disturb people’s minds only to give
women leave to do what there is no probability that they either can or
will do? Why make a revolution on the plea that it will do no harm, when
you cannot shew that it will do any good?” Even if on no other account
than this, it is thoroughly time to bring the question of women’s
capacities into the front rank of the discussion.

But there is a still stronger reason. The most important thing we now
have to do, is to stir up the zeal of women themselves. We have to
stimulate their aspirations—to bid them not despair of anything nor
think anything beyond their reach but try their faculties against all
difficulties. In no other way can the verdict of experience be fairly
collected, & in no other way can we excite the enthusiasm in women which
is necessary to break down the old barriers. This is more important now
than to conciliate opponents. But I do not believe that opponents will
be at all exasperated by taking this line. On the contrary I believe the
point has now been reached at which, the higher we pitch our claims, the
more disposition there will be to concede part of them. All I have yet
heard of the reception of the new book confirms this idea. People tell
me that it is lowering the tone of our opponents as well as raising
Edition: current; Page: [1624] that of our supporters. Everything I hear
strengthens me in the belief, which I at first entertained with a slight
mixture of misgiving that the book has come out at the right time & that
no part of it is premature.

One effect which the suffrage agitation is producing is to make all
sorts of people declare in favour of improving the education of women.
That point is conceded by almost everybody & we shall find the education
movement for women favoured & promoted by many who have no wish at all
that things shd go any further. The cause of political & civil
enfranchisement is also prospering almost beyond hope. You have probably
observed that the admission of women to the municipal franchise has
passed the Commons & is passing the Lords without opposition.4 The bill
for giving married women the control of their own property has passed
through the Commons, all but the third reading & is thought to have a
good chance of becoming law this session.5

Dear Sir

I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of July 3.

I am happy to hear that you anticipate a successful session of the
Social Science Association in October.2 I am much honoured by your wish
that I should read [sic] a paper to be read on the occasion. I have
hitherto, though often solicited, always abstained from taking part by
written papers or otherwise, in the proceedings of any of the various
associations for the discussion of social questions; because I think my
vocation is chiefly to lay the foundations of future improvement by the
discussion of general principles, while the business of associations
like yours is the consideration of immediate practical applications,
dependent on a knowledge of details which I seldom possess nor have time
to acquire. For example on the subject which you suggest to me for a
paper—the Act of Congress on the limitation of labour to eight hours:3
the only part of the question which I feel qualified to treat, is,
whether legislative limitations of the hours of labour can ever be
desirable, or are properly within the competence of governments; to
which my answer would be in the affirmative. But whether, in the
particular circumstances of the working classes of the United States,
such a measure is required, or does more good than harm, I am not in a
condition to discuss. If I feel called upon to study and think out any
practical question with sufficient thoroughness to be qualified to write
upon it, the probable result would be that I should publish a pamphlet
or a book respecting it. On the whole, therefore, you must not count
upon me for a contribution, though it is just possible that, in the
interval before your meeting, some subject may present itself to me on
which I may think that I could usefully address a few pages to your
Association.

I am Dear Sir

Je vous serais donc très obligé si vous vouliez bien procurer pour moi
un exemplaire de ce livre et me l’envoyer par la poste à l’adresse de
Blackheath Park, Kent. J’en enverrai le prix de la manière que vous
aurez la complaisance de m’indiquer.

Nous venons d’avoir un meeting très important de la Société pour le
suffrage des femmes.3 Cette réunion a été admirablement présidée par une
dame4 et il y [a] eu d’excellents discours. Cette question est en grand
progrès ici, et les nombreuses lettres que je reçois témoignent qu’elle

Mon cher Monsieur,

J’ai bien regretté les circonstances qui vous ont empêché de revenir cet
été en Angleterre. J’espère que lorsque vous reprendrez ce projet,
j’aurai l’avantage, dont j’ai été privé cette fois, de faire votre
connaissance personnelle.

Edition: current; Page: [1628]
J’ai à vous remercier des trois importants volumes2 que vous avez bien
voulu m’adresser. J’en ai déjà lu une assez grande partie avec très
grand intérêt. Il y a peu d’écrivains dont les études sur un pays
quelconque valent les vôtres par la précision et l’importance des
renseignements et par la justesse des appréciations. J’espère que votre
voyage en Espagne procurera à vos lecteurs de nouvelles satisfactions.

C’est une chose remarquable quand on pense au nombre de pays où l’état
de la propriété territoriale et les réformes nécessaires pour le rendre
supportable, occupent maintenant l’esprit des penseurs et même des
hommes d’état. Sans parler de l’Espagne, il y a l’Angleterre, l’Irlande,
les Indes anglaises, la Russie. Il n’y a d’exception que pour les pays
où la révolution a passé, et dans ces pays même, ces questions sont loin
d’avoir reçu leur solution définitive.

A défaut de discussion orale, je serais charmé que nous nous
entretenions ensemble par correspondance sur les questions économiques
auxquelles vous faites allusion. L’une d’elles, à ce que m’a dit M.
Leslie, serait la question de l’utilité des colonies pour un pays comme
la Belgique. Là-dessus je partage l’opinion générale des économistes sur
l’inutilité des colonies, seuf peut-être quelques circonstances
spéciales qui n’existent pas, à ma connaissance, pour la Belgique. Si on
prétend qu’il en existe, j’aurais bien envie de les connaître.

Dear Mr. Hare

We had a long discussion at the meeting yesterday on the resolution
drawn up by the Sub Committee.2 In addition to some of those who were at
the past meeting, Jacob Bright and Maclaren were present. The minds of
most of them Edition: current; Page: [1629] proved to be extremely
unprepared on the points which have not yet been fully discussed in the
newspapers. Even Morrison3 could not be made to see the advantage of
keeping land unappropriated for the purpose of experiments. It
conflicted with their notion of “free trade in land.” At last Beales
proposed a new wording of the sixth point making it much more general,
and after some parley this was agreed to. It now stands:—

“As one means of the object last proposed; to endeavour to procure4 such
an administration of landed property owned by public bodies, or held for
any public or charitable purposes, as shall best carry out such object.”

The whole is subject to the confirmation of another meeting, to be held
next Saturday at two, at which I hope you may be able to attend. The
desire to hear your opinion of the new form given to No 6 was one of the
motives for appointing the further meeting.

The new wording will enable us hereafter to bring forward your ideas,
and we may hope to get them adopted by the Association when it has heard
them sufficiently discussed.5 But the approximation made to them in the
present wording is as much as, I think, any of the members of parliament
present except Fawcett would pledge himself to, by joining the
Association. And it is desirable to carry them with us, if only in hopes
of their future conversion, which I do not by any means despair of. I am

Aug. 18. 1869

Dear Sir—

I have been long without acknowledging your letter of July 20 because
there were several points in it on which I wished to make some remarks &
I have not had time to do this sooner. Even now I am unable to do
Edition: current; Page: [1633] it at any length. You have, I doubt not,
understood what I have endeavoured to impress upon the readers of my
book,2 that the opinions expressed in it respecting the natural
capacities of women are to be regarded as provisional; perfect freedom
of development being indispensable to afford the decisive evidence of
experiment on the subject: & if as you truly say, conventionalities have
smothered nature still more in women than in men, the greater is the
necessity for getting rid of the conventionalities before the nature can
be manifested. I have however thought it indispensable to weigh such
evidence as we have & examine what conclusions it points to, & I
certainly think that in all matters in which women do not entirely lean
upon men, they have shown a very great amount of practical talent. I do
not read the new evidence respecting Queen Elizabeth as you seem to do.3
She was already known to have had weaknesses of vanity & temper, but
with the means of realising her position now afforded to us by the mass
of contemporary documents transcribed by Froude,4 I confess she seems to
me to have taken on the whole more just views of general policy than her
critics. For example: with the very small pecuniary resources she had (a
thing generally forgotten) the economy absolutely indispensable could
only be enforced by making those whom she employed (every one of whom
was always in great need of money for the purposes of his department)
feel constantly extreme difficulty in getting it & the strongest motive
to do without it if he could. Again, with half or more than half her
subjects Catholics, herself under the ban of the Pope5 & with a Catholic
competitor for the throne,6 was it not wise in her to take advantage as
long as she could of the real indisposition of the powerful Philip7 (an
indisposition never fully known till now) to drive her to extremities?
We are bound to remember that after all that is said of the danger to
which she exposed England & Protestantism by her parsimony &
over-caution, the event has justified her; England & Protestantism
survived the risk & came out with greatly increased power & éclat.

Edition: current; Page: [1634]
If you have read Mr Motley’s last two volumes,8 you will have observed a
great change in his tone respecting Elizabeth. There are no more of the
disparaging comments of his earlier volumes but on the contrary her
abilities are always spoken of with great respect.

As you truly say, queens, & kings, too, are now superfluous; but the
experience which women have given of themselves as queens is not
obsolete. They are not now wanted as queens, but the qualities which
made them successful as queens are still the conditions of success in
all the practical affairs of mankind.

I thought it best not to discuss the questions about marriage & divorce
along with that of the equality of women; not only from the obvious
inexpediency of establishing a connexion in people’s minds between the
equality, & any particular opinions on the divorce question, but also
because I do not think that the conditions of the dissolubility of
marriage can be properly determined until women have an equal voice in
determining them, nor until there has been experience of the marriage
relation as it would exist between equals. Until then I should not like
to commit myself to more than the general principle of relief from the
contract in extreme cases.

B[lackheath] P[ark]

Aug. 18. 1869

Dear Mr Robertson—

Want of time has prevented me from sooner thanking you for the very
interesting letter you wrote to me on the subject of my little book.2 On
the few points which you criticise you shew so clear a discernment of
both sides of the question that there is little need or scope for
answering you. Only on the smallest of them the good government of
Indian princesses,3 do your remarks present anything to be corrected. In
an Asiatic principality good government (even comparative) is never
obtainable by letting alone. It is obtained by an ever watchful eye & a
strong hand, depending as it does upon a rigid & vigorous control of the
subordinate agents of Edition: current; Page: [1635] government, whose
power of plunder & tyranny if left to themselves is irresistible. The
rulers who do let things alone, are those whose affairs fall into
disorder & their countries into anarchy through their supineness & self
indulgence; & these are generally male rulers. The measure of good
government in the East is the closeness of the ruler’s application to
business; & it is really remarkable that the instances of this should be
so preponderant in the temporary rule of women as regents.

The comparison of women to slaves4 was of course not intended to run on
all fours. I thought the differences too obvious to need stating, & that
the fundamental resemblances were what required to be insisted on. But a
different judgment coming from you cannot but be valuable to me.

The most important of your points is the suggestion of a possible
turning of what is said about the usefulness of the present feminine
type as a corrective to the present masculine, into an argument for
maintaining the two types distinct by difference of training.5 You have
yourself gone into considerations of great importance in answer to this
argument, all of which I fully accept. I shd add some others to them,
as, first, it is not certain that the differences spoken of are not
partly at least natural ones, which would subsist in spite of identity
of training; secondly the correction which the one type supplies to the
excesses of the other is very imperfectly obtained now owing to the very
circumstance that women’s sphere & men’s are kept so much apart. At
present, saving fortunate exceptions, women have rather shown the good
influence of this sort which they might exercise over men, than actually
exercised it.

We have much regretted that your absence prevented us from seeing
anything of you during our summer stay here; but what is a loss to us is
a gain to you. We shall hope to be indemnified when we are next in
England. We leave for Avignon in two or three days.

Aug. 30. 1869

Dear Sir

Your letter is extremely gratifying, and shows how much may be done by
real earnestness and public spirit. You have done very wisely to write
to the Post Master General about the Petition2 because I have seen some
causes to suspect that members of Parliament are not altogether to be
trusted in this matter. Certain it is, that during the time I was in
Parliament, no petitions sent to me by post—and I believe I had more
than the average number—ever failed to be delivered by the post; also
that among all the petitions got up by or for the London Women’s
Suffrage Society, I have never heard of one directed to the Society that
failed to come to hand. It is exceedingly desirable that the petitions
should whenever possible be forwarded by the constituents direct to
their own member, but it is singular that failures on the part of the
Post Office generally take place in these cases. Possibly there is some
failure in the delivery at the House of Commons: nevertheless I myself
had always every cause to think highly of the attention and exactitude
of the officers of the House, and it never happened to me to lose
anything from their neglect, any more than through the neglect of the
Post Office.

I send you some reports of the meeting of the London Women’s Suffrage
Society,3 and you can have any number that you would like to distribute
among your friends. To be a member of the Society it is only necessary
to subscribe one shilling per annum and to give the name and address.
You can either send in your own name and address and that of any friends
who wish to be members, along with the necessary postage stamps, to Mrs.
P. A. Taylor, Aubrey House, Notting Hill, London, W. (Honorary Secretary
of the Society) or to me. The former would be the simpler and quicker,
and you will receive receipts from Mrs. Taylor in due time and also in
future as many copies as you would like to have of all the publications
of the Society. I will ask Mrs. Fawcett, wife of Professor Fawcett M.P.,
whether it would be possible for her to go and speak at Stoke. Either
she or Mrs Taylor would speak well, if it were possible for either of
them to make arrangements to do so. It is just possible that my friend
Professor Fawcett might be able himself to go to Stoke, and the cause of
Women’s Suffrage has no more active, judicious and useful friends than
Mr and Mrs Fawcett.

The Land Tenure Reform Association is only in process of formation. As
soon as the terms of membership are settled, I will let you know.

Sept. 9. 1869

Mon cher Monsieur—

Les raisons indiquées dans votre lettre, comme celles que mettent en
avant les partisans de la fondation de colonies belges, me paraissaient,
comme à vous, extrêmement faibles. Il me semble d’ailleurs que cette
fondation, regardée comme moyen d’assurer un marché aux produits de
l’industrie belge, suppose le maintien de privilèges exclusifs en faveur
de la mère patrie: ce qui est tout à fait repoussé par les lumières du
siècle, et ne serait certainement pas supporté par les colonies,
lorsqu’elles se seraient assez développées pour offrir un débouché de
quelque valeur.

Une meilleure raison serait que la création d’une nouvelle province,
unie avec la mère patrie par un même sentiment de patriotisme, pourrait
être un surcroît de force en cas de danger de la part de l’étranger.
Mais à cela, on peut répondre que si l’indépendance de la Belgique est
exposée à quelque danger d’envahissement, ce serait plutôt dans un temps
très prochain. On doit espérer qu’en moins de temps qu’il n’en faudrait
pour qu’une colonie devint assez importante pour avoir quelque poids
dans la balance des événements, il n’y aura plus de grandes monarchies
militaires, prêtes à fondre sur les petits pays, au premier prétexte qui
se présente.

Quant à la “Subjection of Women”, j’ai à vous remercier de vos
renseignements sur l’éducation des demoiselles en Allemagne. Il se peut
que je n’aie pas rendu pleine justice à l’instruction qu’elles
reçoivent. Cependent, on m’assure que, si elles apprennent plusieurs
langues modernes, elles ne s’en servent guère pour la lecture, et que
même dans leur propre langue, elles ne lisent, en générale, que la
littérature la plus légère. Il est vrai aussi que l’éducation des jeunes
Françaises est ordinairement très défectueuse; cependant, il y a un
assez grand nombre de Françaises qui prouvent par leurs écrits qu’elles
sont douées d’une instruction assez solide, tandis qu’en Allemagne, les
femmes Edition: current; Page: [1638] quelque peu lettrées, comme
Bettina,2 comme Rahel3 ou même comme la comtesse Hahn-Hahn,4 semblent
être en très petit nombre. Après cela, qu’il y ait en Allemagne beaucoup
de femmes d’un talent pratique distingué, je le crois sans difficulté;
mais je pense qu’il y en a partout.

Je pense que la vie de famille n’a rien à craindre de la parfaite
égalite politique et civile des deux sexes. Cette vie est tellement
essentielle à l’humanité, qu’elle ne risque pas de s’ébranler et ne
peut, ce me semble, que gagner, comme toutes les autres relations
sociales, en étant régie par l’accord des volontés, au lieu du pouvoir
arbitraire d’un des conjoints. Quant au vote politique des femmes, s’il
pouvait s’établir dès aujourdhui, il y aurait sans doute un danger
temporaire du côté de “l’influence cléricale”, mais il s’en faut de
beaucoup que nous en soyens là. Et n’est-ce pas surtout parce que les
femmes n’ont pas de voix dans la politique ni dans la conduite des
affaires, que les hommes les abandonnent à l’influence des prêtres, dans
l’idée, au moins dans les pays catholiques, que cela ouvre une voie à
leur sensibilité naturelle, sans que cela puisse tirer à conséquence, et
même en assurant davantage leur fidélité conjugale? C’est un calcul très
peu pré voyant et qui ne pourrait pas durer, si les femmes avaient des
droits dont l’exercice peu éclairé pourrait compromettre ce qu’on
regarde comme de très graves intérêts, même matériels.

Agréez, mon cher Monsieur, l’expression de ma considération la plus
distinguée.

Dear Sir—

My letters are forwarded to me from England once a week & I received
your letter of the 1st too late for you to receive my reply on Monday.
Any one who would draw out a careful statement of exactly the points
indicated Edition: current; Page: [1639] in your letter would be doing a
very great service to the public, but it would be difficult to get
correct information on all these points. The ballot in the U. S. of
America is I believe universal, but also, I believe, quite inoperative
as to secrecy. The same thing is true of France, & true to a
considerable extent of the Australian colonies. It is said, that in some
of the Australian colonies & in Greece, the secret is well kept. I
believe that it would be next to impossible to get authentic information
on all these points except on the spot or by a long & varied
acquaintance with natives of each country, as most people make very
loose & careless statements even on the most literal matters of fact, &
it is necessary to collate the statements of a great many, to get at the
facts even in one individual case. To draw out a really trustworthy
comparative table of the mere bare facts concerning the ballot would be
a matter of time & labour requiring a good deal of cooperation. It would
probably well repay the labour, but there exists no association that I
know of for the purpose of combating the Ballot in any way. I do not
think that the almost certainty of the Ballot being tried in England
before long shd be any discouragement, but the contrary, to our efforts
to get at the truth about it, & should you & your friends be disposed to
undertake any labours of the kind I shall be happy to furnish you with
introductions to any of my foreign friends & correspondents. Mr Arthur
Arnold2 has written an account of the method practised in Greece to
secure secrecy & I believe has mentioned in that some of the other
systems which are inoperative in this respect, & I believe this is the
best & almost the only attempt to give statements of mere facts on the
subject in English.

In America it would appear that nobody desires to keep his vote secret &
that the ballot is preferred only as a convenient & quiet mode of
collecting the votes. I observe also that the eulogiums one often hears
from Australia on the working of the Ballot in Victoria turn almost
entirely on the tranquillity & good order in which the elections are
there conducted through abolition of the open poll. Now it is evident
that these benefits do not at all depend on the secrecy of the votes,
but on their being given in the silent mode of putting tickets into a
box; & would be equally attained if the voter were required to sign his
name to his voting ticket.

Dear Madam—

I beg to acknowledge, with many thanks, your letter of Aug. 10.

You have perceived, what I should wish every one who reads my little
book to know that whatever there is in it which shews any unusual
insight into nature or life was learnt from women—from my wife, and
subsequently also from her daughter.

What you so justly say respecting the infinitely closer relationship of
a child to its mother than to its father, I have learnt from the same
source to regard as full of important consequences with respect to the
future legal position of parents & children. This, however, is a portion
of the truth for which the human mind will not, for some time, be
sufficiently prepared to make its discussion useful.

But I do not perceive that this closer relationship gives any ground for
attributing a natural superiority in capacity of moral excellence to
women over men. I believe moral excellence to be always the fruit of
education & cultivation, & I see no reason to doubt that both sexes are
equally capable of that description of cultivation. But the position of
irresponsible power in which men have hitherto lived is, I need hardly
say, most unfavourable to almost every kind of moral excellence. So far
as women have been in possession of irresponsible power they too have by
no means escaped its baneful consequences.

With hearty congratulations on the progress of the cause of women in
both our countries & in most other parts of the civilized world, I am &c

only matter which I can furnish is a few dates. Born in London, May 20,
1806. Educated wholly by my father, James Mill, author of History of
British India, Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind, and other
works. In 1823 received an appointment in the East India House, and rose
progressively to be the head of the principal office of correspondence
between the home authorities and the local government of India, a post
which had been held by my father. Quitted the service in 1858, when the
functions of the East India Company were transferred to the Crown.
Married in 1851 to Harriet, daughter of Thomas Hardy Esq. of Birksgate,
near Huddersfield and widow of John Taylor Esq merchant of London; who
died in 1858. Elected to Parliament for Westminster in 1865; was an
unsuccessful candidate for that city in 1868.

Oct. 5. 1869

Dear Mr Leslie

I am your debtor for two interesting letters, one from Peyrusse, the
other from London, the last of which owing to an excursion we were
making from home I did not receive until a week after it was written.
You seem to have had a long & varied tour & I look forward with much
pleasure to reading your observations on the districts you visited, more
especially as I have but little personal acquaintance with most of them.
In regard to Britany in most parts of which I have travelled formerly2 I
thought its backwardness even then much exaggerated, but Rennes & its
neighbourhood are a favourable specimen. What the French call “La
Bretagne Bretonnante” is, or was fifteen years ago much wilder, though
really very like the wilder parts of England. I should like to know your
opinion of M. Victor Bonnet.3 Judging from his article on the Gold
question in the Revue des 2 Mondes of 15th August last4 he seems but a
poor political economist. Though acquainted with your speculations on
the subject he seems quite at sea as to the application of them.

It seems to me that whatever can be justly said against women’s fitness
for politics either on the score of narrowness or violence of
partisanship arises chiefly if not wholly, from their exclusion from
politics. Their social position allows them no scope for any feelings
beyond the family except personal likings & dislikes, & it is assumed
that they would be governed entirely by these in their judgment &
feeling in political matters. But it is precisely by creating in their
minds a concern for the interests which are common to all, those of
their country & of human improvement, that the tendency to look upon all
questions as personal questions would most effectually be corrected.

My daughter thinks the opinions expressed by the ladies you mention5
very natural for French men & women & those whose ideas have been most
formed by French literature & for two reasons:—

1. The peculiar bringing up of women has on the whole from a
multiplicity of causes having to do with the history of the nation &
also with race Edition: current; Page: [1643] peculiarities tended in
England to make women both weaker & gentler than men; in France, to make
them more energetic and passionate. This passion & energy is chiefly
used up in rivalry with other women, & a habit of fierce, passionate
contest between women as individuals is acquired. What helps to this is
that energetic Frenchwomen are apt to be less domestic than energetic
Englishwomen partly on account of the smaller families, partly of the
custom of sending the children out to nurse and to pension. Their
energies are thus devoted in greater proportion than in England to
rivalry with other women in dress, in love affairs, & in social success;
so that being at once more energetic & more given to using their
energies in specific contests for superiority with other women, they are
more disposed to personal enmities.

2. It is probably true that women on the average are more what the
French mean by jealous than men; it is certainly true that the less
civilised people are more jealous in this sense than the more civilised;
probably on this account it is that women are more jealous than men as
certainly the French are more jealous than the English. There seems
however good reason to think that one of the specific benefits of
political freedom is that it diminishes this moral vice of jalousie to
which the French are more subject than any other people I know, in
private affairs, although not more so than the Spaniards & Greeks in
politics. You have evidently seen the true answer when you say that the
habit of combination for common objects which is always induced by
political freedom is the cure for the passionate & self willed
disposition of which the French accuse women & other nations accuse the
French.

I inclose three French postage stamps of 20 centimes being the
equivalent of those inclosed in your letter.

Dear Sir—

Your letter of Sept 29 has just reached me. I am very glad to hear of so
many & such good adhesions. It is a proof that many have arrived at the
conviction that the time has come for making some improvement in the
land laws. But the subject has been so little discussed that there is
sure to be great difference of opinion as to what that improvement shd
be. I myself agree in principle with Mr Odger & his friends;2 but if the
Assn were to adopt Edition: current; Page: [1644] as its purpose the
resumption of all the land from its proprietors it could not hope for
any support except from a portion of the working classes. The proposal
is entirely new & startling to all other classes & a great deal of
preparation will be required to induce them even to listen to it
patiently. An Association to agitate on a question is seldom timely or
useful until the public have first been to a certain degree familiarized
with the subject so that hopes may be entertained of making at once a
considerable show of strength. We are certainly very far from this point
in regard to the question of taking possession of all the land &
managing it by the State; I say nothing at present of the reasonable
doubt which may be entertained whether we have yet reached such a degree
of improvement as would enable so vast a concern to be managed on
account of the public without a perfectly intolerable amount of jobbing.
I merely say that the general mind of the country is as yet totally
unprepared to entertain the question. It is possible that the active
spirits in the working classes may think nothing worth trying for short
of this, & may consequently withhold their support from the Assn. I
think this would be a great mistake; but we must be prepared for the
possibility of it.

I agree with Mr Taylor in thinking that the alteration which was
proposed in Art 5,3 which seems to let in claims to an interest in the
land on the part of the working classes generally as distinguished from
those who are actually at work on the land is more than verbal & exceeds
the reasonable powers of a Sub Committee.

With regard to my attendance at the first meeting of the Assn I shall be
able to speak more precisely when I know at what time it is proposed to
hold the meeting, & what is to be done there. I am anxious that you shd
understand clearly that the only relation which I can hold towards the
Assn is that of a member, & occasional speaker. You talk of “leadership”
but that is entirely out of the question.4 It would be impossible for me
to undertake a prominent position in the Assn without giving to it an
amount of time and labour which I do not feel called upon to give;
withdrawing me as it would do from literary occupations to which, both
on public and private [grounds] I prefer to devote my energies.

I have much pleasure in inclosing a note I have received from Mr W.
Edition: current; Page: [1645] Rossiter, the manager of the South London
Working Men’s College.5 He will be a most desirable & valuable member of
the Assn. I have referred him to you for all points of information.

Cher Monsieur—

Parmi toutes les adhésions qui ont été données à la thèse de mon petit
livre2 je ne sais s’il y en a aucune qui m’ait fait plus de plaisir que
la vôtre; et cela non seulement à cause de l’influence que donne à vos
opinions votre position si importante dans le monde des lettres3 mais
encore plus par la confirmation de ma conviction que les âmes poétiques,
lorsqu’elles sont jointes à une intelligence éclairée ne verront rien
qui leur répugne dans la modification que la justice exige dans les
relations sociales entre les deux sexes. En effet dans toute société qui
n’est pas profondément démoralisée il n’y a pas à craindre que l’homme
ne cherche pas à idéaliser la femme. La nature l’y portera toujours:
mais ici comme dans tout le reste, il s’agit pour l’idéal de ne pas trop
s’écarter des conditions de la réalité. Autrement on aurait d’une part
un idéal incompatible avec les conditions de la vie, et d’autre part une
vie réelle toute prosaïque dans laquelle on retomberait toujours. Il en
est ainsi de l’idéal que beaucoup de poètes ont voulu établir pour les
femmes. Ils se sont figuré un être tout de fantaisie, qui aurait besoin
pour exister d’un monde aussi imaginaire que lui; ils ont proposé aux
femmes cet être-là pour modèle, et quand elles tâchent de s’y conformer
en toute sincérité ou en apparence, elles se heurtent contre les dures
exigences de la vie réelle qui s’opposent invinciblement à la
réalisation. Qu’on s’efforce tant qu’on veut à écarter de la vie des
femmes ces exigences, on n’en vient jamais à bout: d’abord, pour la très
grande majorité du sexe féminin c’est Edition: current; Page: [1646]
matiérellement impossible; et chez le petit nombre des privilégiées il
en reste toujours assez pour les rendre dures, égoistes et cruelles, à
moins d’en être préservées par une culture morale qui serait tout aussi
efficace dans un état de choses plus naturel. Il me semble que l’idéal
propre à l’existence humaine serait tout autre que cet idéal de
fantaisie, sans être pour cela moins poétique: ce serait l’idée d’une
personne complète dans toutes ses facultés, propre à toutes les tâches
et à toutes les épreuves de la vie, mais qui les remplirait avec une
grandeur d’âme, une force de raison et une tendresse de coeur très
au-dessus de ce qui a lieu maintenant, sauf peut-être chez les plus
admirables caractères dans leurs moments de plus grande exaltation. Si
cet idéal a jamais été offert au genre humain c’est dans le Christ, et
je ne sais pas ce qu’on pourrait demander de mieux soit à un homme soit
à une femme sous le rapport de perfectionnement moral, que de lui
ressembler. Or ce caractère-là est aussi profondément réel que
poétiquement élevé et émouvant.

Dear Sir

I return your paper of questions, with answers annexed as you request.
The most common of the informalities which prevent a petition from being
received, is a breach of the rule that at least one of the signatures
should be written on the sheet of paper on which the petition itself is
written. A single signature on the same sheet authenticates it as at
least the petition of somebody: but if all the signatures are on sheets
pasted on, there is no positive assurance that any of them were really
intended for the petition to which they are in that manner annexed.

Your petition,2 however, seems never to have reached the stage at which
it could be rejected for informality; since this takes place after, not
before, the petition has been presented to the House and referred to the
Committee of Petitions. If your petition never reached the member to
whom it was addressed (which from your former letter I understood to be
affirmed by him) the miscarriage (if you are sure that it was posted)
must either be imputable to the Post Office or to the officers of the
House of Commons.

I will write to ascertain whether it will be possible for Mr and Mrs
Fawcett, or any other of the ladies of the Committee, to attend and
speak at a meeting in your borough.3 I will also direct the publishers
to send you a number of copies of the little book. There seems a great
probability that the Edition: current; Page: [1647] question will be
brought forward in the House next session; but people should be willing
to petition whether this is the case or not. A great question is seldom
carried without long perseverance in working for it.

I shall always be happy to hear your opinions on any subject on which
you like to write to me.

Dear Mr Fawcett

Mr William Wood, a working man in the Potteries, who has long been a
correspondent of mine, and is one of the most thoughtful and sensible
working men with whom I have ever been in communication, is of opinion
that a public meeting on Women’s Suffrage might usefully be held, or at
the least a lecture delivered, in the borough of Stoke on Trent, and
offers to take upon himself the work of making the necessary
arrangements, provided that one of the leaders of the movement is able
to be present, and especially if, as he says, “one at least of the
ladies who are the glory and no small part of the strength of the
movement be present to speak to us in its advocacy.” This last he
considers of primary importance. He will write further on the details of
arrangements if I can tell him that you and Mrs Fawcett would be able
and willing to take part. Mr Wood was the first to broach the subject in
the local press, and has ascertained by a successful personal canvass
for signatures to a petition that “there is really a large body of
people in the Borough who are favourable to the movement, and who with a
little organisation, would be willing to give an active support to it.”
He adds “I have assurance of assistance in any future action in the
matter from many of the most active and intelligent politicians amongst
my own class, and also from some of the few with whom I came in contact
of the wealthier classes in the borough.” A meeting, therefore, under
your and Mrs Fawcett’s auspices would not be likely to be a failure, and
might tend to promote the movement among the working classes in general;
and Mr Wood thinks that the presence of a lady among its advocates might
encourage ladies in the locality to join. It seems a pity that such
favourable promise should not be taken advantage of. Next Edition:
current; Page: [1648] to a meeting, a lecture by Mrs Fawcett would be
most useful, and the same lecture might afterwards be delivered in other
places. If you and Mrs Fawcett look favourably on the proposal, I think
you will find Mr Wood capable of fulfilling all he promises. His address
is 6 Hawkesmere Street, Hanley, Stoke on Trent.

The cause seems to be prospering everywhere. There are responses to my
little book in almost all parts of Europe. It is being translated into
Polish; I have had three proposals for translating it into Russian and a
greater number than I can remember into German.2 The reviews of it,
whether favourable or hostile, are in general very encouraging.

The Land Association also has got together a great number of very good
adhesions. I only hope it will be possible to keep adherents together
who differ so much in the length they intend to go. This can only be
done by leaving many important points as open questions for discussion
within the Association itself.

My daughter sends her kindest regards to Mrs Fawcett, and I am

Dear Mrs. Taylor,—

One of my working-men correspondents, and the most thoughtful and
intelligent of them, Mr. William Wood, of Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, who
has lately enrolled himself as a member of the London Woman Suffrage
Society, is very desirous of having a public meeting, or, if that should
be impossible, a lecture in his borough, and offers to take upon himself
the work of making the arrangements; but he considers it a sine qua non
that “one at least of the ladies who are the glory and no small part of
the strength of the movement, be present to speak to us in its
advocacy.” . . .

I have written to propose to Mrs. Fawcett to take up the project;2 if
she does not, would it be impossible for you to do so? It would be
unfair to Edition: current; Page: [1649] ask you, who have so much on
your hands in the central direction of the movement, to work at the
outposts when the work can be done by anyone else, but we rely so much
on your public spirit that we cannot help looking to you as a reserve
when others fail. The cause has now reached a point at which it has
become extremely desirable that the ladies who lead the movement should
make themselves visible to the public, their very appearance being a
refutation of the vulgar nonsense talked about “women’s rights women,”
and their manner of looking, moving, and speaking being sure to make a
favourable impression from the purely feminine as well as from the human
point of view.

Dear Sir

In deference to your wishes I have taken some days to reconsider the
subject of your letter but the result is that I adhere to my resolution
of not accepting the Presidentship of the Association.2

Edition: current; Page: [1650]
When I was asked to take the Chair at the first meeting of the
Committee, & when Mr Beales & yourself shewed a desire to put my name
forward to the public, I distinctly said that it would not suit me to be
President, or to take the leading part in the conduct of the
Association, and it was on that understanding only that I consented to
be Chairman of the Provisional Committee. It is repugnant to me to be
ostensibly at the head of any undertaking unless I am prepared to devote
my utmost efforts to make it succeed; & the land question
notwithstanding its importance is only one of a number of subjects which
have a claim on my time & exertions. I therefore do not think it
required by or consistent with my duty to devote myself to this one
movement even if it were clear, which it is not to me, that I am the
fittest person to take the lead in it.

With regard to attending the first public meeting, it would not be
impossible for me to do so, at any time not earlier than the latter end
of November. But it seems to me quite premature to appoint a public
meeting as long as there is the present uncertainty about our pecuniary
means. You say that the Education League3 is up & doing & that therefore
the Land Association should be up & doing too. But if the newspapers
speak truth, the Education League has already raised many thousands of
pounds. I think it imprudent to give publicity to our proceedings in any
way until we are privately assured of an amount of support which will
prevent the possibility of a total break down in the attempt to form a
Society. Our first duty is if possible to guard against this. We cannot
hold meetings & carry on agitation like the Education League unless we
have as much money. We shall need ample donations from our richer
members & an annual subscription from all, and until assured of these I
think it better not to come before the public.

With regard to the Programme, the reason which led me to suggest a
modification of it, has been taken away by the formation of a separate
organisation by some of the leaders of the working classes for their own
programme.4 If they think the time has come to agitate for their more
extreme objects, they will give but a cold support if any support at
all, to ours, & it is useless going out of our way to attract them. I
myself should differ Edition: current; Page: [1651] from them even as to
the waste lands. I should be sorry to see the whole of these farmed out
& given up to cultivation. I wish a great part of them to remain in
their native wildness & natural beauty. There is little enough beauty in
our common life, & we cannot afford to sacrifice what we have. It is in
the lands owned by public bodies & charitable institutions that I would
try the experiment of state or municipal management.

I wish it clearly understood that if I am present at all at any public
meeting it must not be as presiding but merely as one of the speakers.

You are aware of the favour with which the majority of the popular party

as a means of restraining bribery and intimidation, and the increased
interest which this question has assumed through the recent extension of
the suffrage. The writer of the inclosed letter,2 and some of his

respecting the practical working of vote by ballot in the countries in
which it exists by law. Their own opinion, like mine, is unfavourable to
it; but their desire is to find the truth, whatever it may be; and the
vague impressions current in Europe give no real knowledge of the ballot
in America even as it exists by law, much less of the mode in which it
is actually conducted, and the advantages and disadvantages which are
found in practice to attend it. You would oblige me very much, and would

Cher Monsieur—

Je vous remercie de m’avoir envoyé le Journal des Débats.2 La notice par
M. Taine dépasse beaucoup en louanges, et ce qui vaut mieux, en
adhésion, tout ce qu’on pouvait espérer. J’ai lu dans la Revue l’article
de M. Janet.3 J’ai lieu de lui savoir gré encore plus que vous, des
égards qu’il nous montre. Quant à la substance de l’article, mon
appréciation diffère peu de la vôtre. La tentative qu’il fait de prouver
l’existence objective des corps par un argument semblable à celui dont
je me sers pour établir la réalité d’autres êtres sentants et pensants,
est ingénieuse mais sans valeur aucune. Son exemple des deux lutteurs ne
prouve que ce qu’on ne songe pas à nier, savoir que les possibilités
permanentes de sensation qui sont de la catégorie de ce que nous nommons
résistance, se trouvent quelquefois liées à une conviction rationelle
d’une autre sensation de résistance hors de nous, à quoi l’on peut
ajouter que leur réalisation dépend quelquefois d’une volonté hors de
nous. Tout cela n’a aucune difficulté dès qu’on admet la réalité de
sensations et de volitions autres que les siennes propres.

Quant au problème général. M. Janet le déplace complètement. On lui dit
que la force n’est qu’un phénomène, et il vous répond en prouvant la
force, comme si vous aviez dit qu’elle n’existe pas.

Je viens aussi de lire l’opuscule de M. Renouvier.4 Sauf la question du
libre arbitre, que du reste il a pu poser plus nettement et d’une
manière plus rationelle qu’on ne la pose ordinairement, parcequ’il a
renoncé à sauver la prescience divine: sauf cette question, dis-je, il
ne me semble pas qu’il y ait beaucoup de différence entre ses opinions
et les miennes, sur les grandes questions de la métaphysique. Il nie la
substance, il réduit les corps à des groupes de phénomènes. Il croit à
la vérité me dépasser lorsqu’il nie l’infini, et il pense qu’en
soutenant l’intelligibilité non de l’infini abstrait mais de l’infini
quoad hoc j’ai voulu laisser une ouverture pour des spéculations
transcendantes. Il n’en est rien: mon but était pratique, et surtout
moral; Edition: current; Page: [1653] j’ai voulu montrer que s’il existe
un être possédant un attribut quelconque porté a l’infini, cet attribut
doit être qualitativement identique au même attribut s’arrêtant au fini;
que, par exemple un Dieu infiniment bon ne peut être bon que de la bonté
humaine. Ma controverse avec Mansel aurait dû prouver à M. Renouvier la
grande importance morale, dans un milieu croyant, de cette thèse.

La réponse de M. Huxley à M. Congreve a déjà paru, dans le même recueil
périodique que la conférence.5 Par un heureux accident j’ai conservé
cette réponse et je vous l’envoie par la poste. C’est une critique amère
de Comte, parfois juste, plus souvent injuste ou exagérée, et qui me
paraît dans son ensemble extrêmement faible. Pour rendre justice à
Huxley il faut se rappeler que le volume le plus imparfait et surtout le
plus arriéré de la Philosophie Positive est celui qui traite de la
chimie et de la biologie,6 et que ces deux sciences sont justement
celles que Huxley connaît le mieux. Je ne lui crois pas de grandes
connaissances dans les sciences qui dépendent de la mathématique:
lorsqu’il se hasarde à contester les généralisations de Comte sur la
philosophie générale des sciences, tout ce qu’il dit est tellement
superficiel que le moindre disciple de Comte n’aurait pas de peine à le
réfuter.

TO HENRY GEORGE1

Oct. 23, 1869

Dear Sir

The subject on which you have asked my opinion, involves two of the most
difficult and embarrassing questions of political morality; the extent
and Edition: current; Page: [1654] limits of the right of those who have
first taken possession of an unoccupied portion of the earth’s surface,
to exclude the remainder of mankind from inhabiting it; and the means
which can be legitimately used by the more improved branches of the
human species to protect themselves from being hurtfully encroached upon
by those of a lower grade in civilisation. The Chinese immigration into
America raises both these questions. To furnish a general answer to
either of them would be a most arduous undertaking.

Concerning the purely economical view of the subject I entirely agree
with you; and it could hardly be better stated and argued than it is in
your able article in the New York Tribune.2 That the Chinese
immigration, if it attains great dimensions, must be economically
injurious to the mass of the present population; that it must diminish
their wages, and reduce them to a lower stage of physical comfort and
well-being, I have no manner of doubt. Nothing can be more fallacious
than the attempts to make out that thus to lower wages is the way to
raise them; or that there is any compensation in an economical point of
view to those whose labour is displaced, or who are obliged to work for
a greatly reduced remuneration. On general principles, this state of
things, were it sure to continue, would justify the exclusion of the
immigrants, on the ground that with their habits in respect to
population, only a temporary good is done to the Chinese people by
admitting part of their surplus numbers, while a permanent harm is done
to a more civilised and improved portion of mankind.

But there is much also to be said on the other side. Is it justifiable
to assume that the character and habits of the Chinese are unsusceptible
of improvement? The institutions of the United States are the most
potent means that have yet existed of spreading the most important
elements of civilisation down to the poorest and most ignorant of the
labouring masses. If every Chinese child were compulsorily brought under
your school system, or under a still more effective one if possible, and
kept under it for a sufficient number of years, would not the Chinese
population be in time raised to the level of the American? I believe
indeed that hitherto the numbers of Chinese born in America has not been
very great: but so long as this is the case—so long (that is) as the
Chinese do not come in families & settle, but those who come are mostly
men and return to their native country, the evil can hardly reach so
great a magnitude as to require that it should be put a stop to by
force.

One kind of restrictive measure seems to me not only desirable, but
absolutely called for; the most stringent laws against introducing
Chinese immigrants as Coolies, i.e. under contracts binding them to the
service of particular persons. All such obligations are a form of
compulsory labour, that is, of slavery: and though I know that the legal
invalidity of such contracts Edition: current; Page: [1655] does not
prevent them from being made, I cannot but think that if pains were
taken to make it known to the immigrants that such engagements are not
legally binding, and especially if it were made a penal offence to enter
into them, that mode at least of immigration would receive a
considerable check. And it does not seem probable that any other mode,
among so poor a population as the Chinese, can attain such dimensions as
to compete very injuriously with American labour. Short of that point,
the opportunity given to numerous Chinese of becoming familiar with
better and more civilised habits of life, is one of the best chances
that can be opened up for the improvement of the Chinese in their own
country, and one which it does not seem to me that it would be right to
withhold from them.

not generally possessed in England, on the mode of operation of Secret
Suffrage in the countries where it exists in the election of members of
representative bodies. Their opinion, like mine, is unfavourable to
secret voting; but their wish is, not to confirm their existing opinion,
but to know the truth; what are the means taken in different countries
to secure secrecy; how far those means are effective; and in what
respect secrecy, so far as secured, is attended with either good or bad
effects. Could you furnish from your own knowledge, or point out the
means of obtaining, information on these points in the cases of Austria,
Hungary, or any German Government? If you could do so it would be a
valuable contribution to a subject of great & increasing importance in
English politics, and I should myself be sincerely grateful to you for
it.

Oct. 23. 1869

Dear Thornton—

We are most happy to hear that you have had such an interesting holiday2
& that both the weather & your health & spirits were so favourable to
enjoyment. I am much obliged to you for your observations on the peasant
properties. We must try to find out whether the farms which pleased you
so much in North Holland are the property of the farmers.3 With regard
to the internal discomfort of the houses in other places, it is probably
a consequence & sample of the general habits of the country. In most
parts of the Continent the taste for what we call comfort is much less
developed than in England: & peasant properties by the prudential and
calculating habits which they foster, promote frugality as well as
industry (the peasants preferring saving to enjoyment) often exhibit a
very meagre state of living when the means are, as in the case you
mention of the widow near Darmstadt, ample.4 Helen says too that to
understand this subject one must distinguish between comfort & neatness,
although neatness is no doubt an essential to comfort in our eyes. There
would almost seem something of race in the care for neatness, which
Helen says does not follow at all, as one might suppose, the variations
of climate. Some Oriental peoples are very neat, as are the Spaniards
(in the parts of Spain we have visited) & the Greeks. In Greek & Spanish
rooms where the furniture is poor, & there is substantial dirtiness if
vermin may so be called the neatness is often charming, & most
refreshing to the eye & spirits, while in French rooms of the same class
the building will be more solid, the bedding comfortable &
irreproachably clean, & yet the dust and untidiness will be repugnant &
wretched to an English eye. Some of the same curious differences may be
noticed in different parts of Germany, & Helen says that for many years
she has tried Edition: current; Page: [1657] to find any general rule
which will explain these variations. She is inclined to think that it
may perhaps prove that this pleasant tidiness of the home to the eye
depends upon whether the women work out of the house or not, & may have
nothing to do with race, climate, civilisation or wealth. This however
is still a mere hypothesis in her mind.

We too have made an excursion, of about ten days, in the Alps. We
established ourselves at the inn on the top of the pass of Mont Cenis,
6000 feet above the sea, & greatly enjoyed walks among the neighbouring
heights. We had at first splendid weather but as it seemed to be
changing we went off to some little travelled parts of the lower Alps,
south of Grenoble where we had again beautiful weather & much enjoyment.
We have since had a still pleasanter though shorter excursion in the
mountains of the eastern part of our department, in which last excursion
we walked upwards of fifty miles in three days. The improvements in our
own little place are now nearly completed, but until they are quite
finished they continue to give Helen a great deal of troublesome
occupation. I have no report to make as yet of work done, except what
can hardly be called by that name—bringing up arrears of general
reading—but I hope to have better account to give in a little while.
About Carlyle I agree both with you & with Hill.5 It is only at a
particular stage in one’s mental development that one benefits much by
him (to me he was of great use at that stage)6 but one continues to read
his best things with little if any diminution of pleasure after one has
ceased to learn anything from him.

TO HENRY FAWCETT1

Oct. 24. 1869

Dear Mr Fawcett

I had already seen a very brief account in a newspaper,2 of your and Mrs
Fawcett’s proceedings at Warwick, and was extremely pleased with both.
Edition: current; Page: [1658] We are specially delighted that Mrs
Fawcett took the opportunity of speaking for women’s suffrage, and that
she thinks seriously of preparing a lecture. What she has already
written is a guarantee for its being excellent both in matter and stile,
and her person and manner will dispel prejudice and attract adherents
wherever she delivers it. I hope that there will be nothing to prevent
your going to Stoke in January, which, I imagine, will be as suitable a
time for Mr Wood’s purpose as November or December.3 If I may judge from
his correspondence, you will find him an interesting and useful person
to know: he has thought on a great many important subjects, and very
soundly on almost all. What you say about the reception of Mrs Fawcett’s
speech at Warwick, and of the book4 at Brighton, is very encouraging. If
the working men, in any numbers, take up women’s suffrage, it will get
on very fast. We highly approved the course you took and the things you
said at Birmingham.5 I, like you, have a rather strong opinion in favour
of making parents pay something for their children’s education when they
are able, though there are considerable difficulties in authenticating
their inability. At all events I would have it left an open question;
and because they refused to leave that and other secondary questions
open, I did not join the League. But I think you are quite right in
overlooking this consideration, and acting with the League, in order to
form a strong party in the House for the principle of universal and
compulsory unsectarian education.

You will believe how delighted we are that Cairnes is so much recovered,
and is able to resume his Lectures. The pamphlet he mentioned, by George
Campbell,6 was sent to me by the author after it was printed, but before
publication, and I did not know that it was yet published. It appeared
to me a most valuable contribution to the subject. The Cobden Club have
for once done something useful in asking him to write on the Land
question.7 The Land Tenure Reform Association has received a
considerable number of good adhesions, but it has not yet raised any
money; and it is indispensable to know what it is able to do in this way
before attempting to come before the public; for a break down would be
much more ignominious, and much more injurious to the cause, after, than
before, a public demonstration. My name has very unjustifiably been put
forward as President, which I from the first refused to be. I have told
Reid [page torn] my name must not be used in Edition: current; Page:
[1659] this way, as I cannot be President,8 although I am willing to do
anything I can as a member. I do not know whether to be glad or sorry
for the separate organisation which has been started by some leaders of
the working classes for a much more radical alteration of the land
laws.9 The furious and declamatory violence of their Resolutions and
some of their speeches, seems to shew that they would have been a very
intractable element in the other Association and that it is well rid of
them. One thing I see clearly; that there will be more difficulty than
ever in preserving the commons. The working class speakers are filled
with exaggerated ideas of the value of the waste lands for cultivation,
and apparently do not care at all for the preservation of natural
beauty; and if they make any way with their agitation, the landlords
will throw over the commons to save their estates. Our best chance of
avoiding this will be the progress of education in all classes; and
unfortunately it is much easier to improve education in quantity than in
quality. It is no new thing that all good depends on work, but in the
present state of matters the work of the more advanced minds, over and
above its inherent difficulties, has the additional one that it is, in a
certain degree, working against time. But there would be little to fear
if there were a tolerable number who worked with the energy and spirit
that you do. Women’s suffrage will help us in this as in so many other
things, for women will be much more unwilling than men to submit to the
expulsion of all beauty from common life. I am Dear Mr Fawcett

very truly yours

Oct. 24. 1869

Dear Sir—

I have received your letter dated the 18th inst. I need hardly say that
I sympathize in your preference of literary to mercantile occupation;
but all experience proves that of these two, considered as professions,
the latter alone is to be depended on as a means of subsistence & that
the former can only be prudently taken up by persons who are already in
independent Edition: current; Page: [1660] circumstances. It is a rare
good fortune if an author can support himself by his pen, unless as an
editor or sub editor of a newspaper or other periodical; & I suppose
there is not in our day a single instance in which it has been done by
poetry of any kind. All my experience of life confirms the wisdom of the
advice which Coleridge, in his Biographia Literaria,2 gives to writers
even of the greatest genius: to let, if possible, their regular
business, on which they rely for support, be something foreign to their
favourite pursuits, reserving these as the consolation of their leisure
hours. In that case, success, & the favourable estimation of others, are
not a matter of necessity to them; if they produce anything worthy of
being remembered, they can wait for it to be appreciated, or can be
content with the pleasure of the occupation itself. My own conviction is
that to be independent of immediate success is almost an absolute
condition of being able to do anything that greatly deserves to succeed.
Many meritorious literary men would feel themselves saved from lifelong
disappointment if they could exchange their position for one of assured
though moderate income in the vocation which you are so desirous of
quitting for theirs.

With regard to the publication of your work I hardly know what advice to
give. It is easy to obtain a publisher if you are able & willing to take
on yourself the risk of pecuniary loss. But it is difficult to find a
bookseller who is willing to venture anything on the success of a
dramatic poem; there are so many writers of dramatic poems, & so few
buyers of them; & whatever may be the merit of yours, there is no
certainty of its becoming known to the public. Even if an author has
friends who are connected as writers or editors with the literary
periodicals, which people consult to know what books to order from
Mudie’s3 or the circulating libraries, he has but a precarious chance,
for people have learnt to distrust the praises of periodicals. Authors
often build hopes on recommendations to a publisher from some person who
is considered a good judge but these are so often given from mere good
nature that they carry little weight; nor do publishers consider the
merit of a work as a sufficient guarantee of its pecuniary success. For
myself I have no means of aiding you in any of these ways. Even if
authority carried greater weight than it does with publishers, I am not
an authority on these subjects.

What I say to you I have said to many others who have made applications
to me of the same kind, & I sincerely regret that I have nothing more
satisfactory to offer.

In short I see but two alternatives for a young author. He can test the
probable popularity of his work by offering it to publishers & editors
who Edition: current; Page: [1661] whether rightly or not are
practically the judges of this, & if their decision is unfavourable he
must either resign literary work or content himself with working merely
for the love of his work accompanied by any such hopes as he may still
venture to entertain of better success in the future.

Dear Sir—

I thank you & Mrs Barnard heartily for your kindness to Mr Kyllmann.2 I
hardly know your equal in eagerness to do kind offices to your friends
or to your friends’ friends, while from your manner of conferring a
favour any one would suppose that you were receiving one.

I have not written anything on the subject of police. What you have
heard of is doubtless a private letter to one of my active supporters in
Westminster,3 who asked my opinion on the proposal to place “habitual
criminals” under police surveillance, a proposal since embodied in an
Act of Parliament4 some of the provisions of which appear to me very
objectionable. The letter though signed by me was written by my
daughter, who has thought more & to greater purpose on these questions
than I have. It was not intended for publication, but was sent without
my permission to the newspapers. The date of the letter was December 14.
1868, but I have not a copy of any newspaper containing it & do not
remember the date [of] publication.

The multiplication of casts of the finest works of ancient sculpture is
very useful as one among many means of educating the public eye.5 Both
in art & in nature, a certain degree of familiarity is necessary not
merely to the intellectual appreciation but to the enjoyment of the
higher kinds of beauty: Every one who takes pleasure in a simple tune
has the capacity of fully enjoying Weber & Beethoven, but very often he
derives little or no pleasure from a first hearing of them. It is a
great mistake to think that children are not benefitted by living &
growing up among models of beauty. They are on the contrary more
benefitted than any one else, though not, at the time, conscious of the
benefit. I can trace a great influence in my own development Edition:
current; Page: [1662] to the accident of having passed several years of
my boyhood in one of the few old abbeys which are still inhabited,6
instead of a mean & graceless modern house, & having at the same time &
place been familiar with tapestries from Raphael’s cartoons, which
peopled my imagination with graceful & dignified forms of human beings.
There is a great want of this training of the perceptions & taste in our
modern societies; but it is not by any one help or stimulus that the
want can be supplied. The great desideratum in America—& though not
quite in an equal degree, I may say in England too—is the improvement of
the higher education. America surpasses all countries in the amount of
mental cultivation which she has been able to make universal; but a high
average level is not everything; there are wanted, I do not say a class,
but a great number of persons of the highest degree of cultivation which
the accumulated acquisitions of the human race make it possible to give
them. From such persons, in a community that knows no distinction of
ranks, civilisation would rain down its influences upon the remainder of
society, & the higher faculties having been highly cultivated in the
most advanced part of the public would give forth products & create an
atmosphere that would produce a high average of the same faculties in a
people so well prepared in point of general intelligence as the people
of the United States.

I have given an introduction to you, and to two or three of my other
friends in America, to a correspondent of mine in Scotland, Mr. D.
Watson,7 of Hawick, who is anxious to obtain information that can be
depended on (but is under the necessity of asking for it by letter)
respecting the practical operation of Vote by Ballot in the United
States. The example of America is often cited in favour of secret voting
& sometimes against it, but there is a great deficiency of real
information as to how it operates in America & even as to whether there
is real secrecy at all. My correspondent & some of his friends are like
myself unfavourable to secret voting but they are anxious to obtain
whatever light American experience can throw on the practical question.

TO JOHN ELLIOT CAIRNES1

Nov. 16. 1869

Dear Mr Cairnes

It gave us great pleasure to receive a letter from you dated from
London, and to know that you are able not only to live in England but to
lecture this winter. Even if your health has not sensibly improved since
you arrived in England, it is very much that it should have recovered
sufficiently before that time to restore you to active life, and that it
should maintain the improvement under less favourable circumstances of
climate. Your class, I believe, is as large if not larger than has ever
been obtained by a Professor of Political Economy in University College.
The whole career of that Institution is a melancholy proof of the rarity
of any desire in the middle classes of London to give the benefit of a
good education to their sons. They evidently set no value on any
instruction not strictly professional, and I am afraid the manufacturing
districts of England, though in some respects more active-minded are, on
this point, not at all superior to London. In Scotland alone a higher
instruction is valued, probably because the teaching in the elementary
schools has been so managed as to lead up to it; which should be a
lesson to those who have to construct a national system of primary
schools.

It is very kind of you to feel so much interest about my health. There
was no cause of uneasiness from the attack I had at Paris,2 after the
first few hours. Being taken in time, it was soon conquered, and when I
left Paris for England a few days afterwards I was in my usual health,
and have since remained so. My daughter also, though still liable to a
return of her headaches, is much stronger and better than when we
arrived here.

Your letter made me rather ashamed of myself from the belief it shewed
that I must be very busy. Since I have been here this time, I may almost
call Edition: current; Page: [1664] myself idle, having done little but
to bring up old arrears of general reading. And I am seldom for long
together too busy to spare time for anything you ask me to do,
especially anything so pleasant as to read any of your writings. I beg
that you will never allow any scruple to prevent your applying to me
when you think I can be in any way useful: and with respect to the very
interesting book you think of writing (I well remember how highly I
thought of its precursor)3 I should be only too happy to read in the MS.
either any part or the whole. Indeed, if I were to see all of it that
relates to the French political economists as well as to Comte,4 I
should be better able to compare your impression respecting them with my
own. I believe we think pretty much alike about them. French philosophic
writers seem to me decidedly inferior in closeness and precision of
thought to the best English, and more in the habit of paying themselves
with phrases and abstractions. The French political economists share
largely in this defect. It should be remembered however, that there is a
much greater number of them than of English, unless, to make up the
equality we descend to English writers so bad as almost to turn the
average the other way. There are also more exceptions than you perhaps
know to the general vagueness and looseness of thought of French
economists. Besides Say,5 and Turgot,6 of which last Courcelle-Seneuil
says with some reason that it is harder to say what of the truths of the
science he did not anticipate than what he did, there are some now
living who have formed themselves very much upon the stricter and more
precise English model: Joseph Garnier7 especially, in his treatise on
Political Economy. Garnier is an exception to their false conception of
the method of the science. Courcelle-Seneuil, whom I just mentioned, and
who has written a book of considerable merit (Traité Théorique et
Pratique d’Economie Politique)8 is also, to some extent, an exception.
A. E. Cherbuliez of Geneva (who lately died) published in 1862 a “Précis
de la Science Economique et de ses Principales Applications” which I
thought favourably of. The last two of these treatises I have here, and
can send to you if you would like to see them. I Edition: current; Page:
[1665] think both Reybaud9 and Michel Chevalier10 unfavourable specimens
of French economists as to close thinking, and the former is besides of
a narrow and prejudiced school. Bastiat11 shines as a dialectician, and
his reasonings on free trade are as strictly scientific as those of any
one; but his posthumous work (Harmonies Economiques)12 is written with a
parti pris of explaining away all the evils which are the stronghold of
Socialists, against whom the book is directed. The Journal des
Economistes13 you will find in the London Library. A course of that
gives a more correct idea than anything else, of the general
characteristics of French economists: the more, as they occasionally
carry on controversies with one another in its pages, which bring out
their several types of thought. They are divided by two broad lines:
into Malthusians and anti-Malthusians, and into Utilitarians and
anti-Utilitarians. This last distinction extends even to political
economy, in consequence of the prevailing French habit of appealing to
intuitive principles of droit even on economic subjects.

Your news of the Fawcetts is pleasant. I have a high opinion of Mrs
Fawcett’s capabilities, and am always glad to hear of any fresh exercise
of them.14 Respecting the Irish land question, I hardly think it
possible that you and I should not agree entirely, when discussion has
thrown sufficient light upon the details of the question. I feel, with
you, that the reasons for fixity of tenure apply chiefly to ryots, or
labourer-farmers and not to capitalist farmers, for whom leases suffice;
and I feel, also, that by making these last actual proprietors, a fresh
agrarian question may be raised up on the part of the labourers whom
they employ. The chief difficulty I feel is the practical one of having
different laws for large and for small tenants; though I myself, in my
speech in 1868,15 suggested as a possible expedient, to make a
distinction between arable and grazing farms. A propos, there has been a
call from Ireland for a reprint of my two speeches on the land
question,16 together with the chapters on that subject in my Political
Economy;17 and this is now being Edition: current; Page: [1666]
printed.18 Is it not curious that the plan in my pamphlet19 is almost
always spoken of as a simple proposal to buy out the landlords and hold
all the land as the property of the State? though it is palpable to
every one who looks at the pamphlet that my proposal was simply a
permanent tenure at a fixed rent, and that I only offered to any
landlord who disliked this, the option of giving up his land to the
Government instead. Mr George Campbell sent me his paper20 before it was
published, and I quite agree with you as to its great merit. He has
since informed me that he has published it in an enlarged form, and has
sent me a copy. This is at Blackheath, and will be in the first parcel
that comes.

With our kind regards to Mrs Cairnes, whose improved health it gave us
great pleasure to hear of, I am

Dear Mr Cairnes

I will send the Courcelle Seneuil and Cherbuliez2 almost immediately, to
your Hastings address. I by no means answer for their view of the
science, or Edition: current; Page: [1667] Garnier’s either,3 as
unexceptionable at all points; but it is certainly better than that of
the French writers of the present day with whom you appear to be best
acquainted, and I think it necessary for you to know them in order to
form a just judgment of the contemporary French school.

I look forward with great pleasure to reading any portion you like to
shew me of your new book, or indeed of any book of yours.

I expect to receive Mr Campbell’s book4 in a few days. In the meantime,
there is a letter of his in the Daily News of last Tuesday, Nov. 30,5
containing, as I gather, proposals somewhat more specific than those in
his book, and among other things an attempt, though an inadequate one,
to lay down principles to guide the public arbitrator in determining
what is a fair rent. That difficulty is inherent in all plans, however
moderate, which offer any greater security than at present to the tenure
of the occupier. But, after all, a question cannot be insoluble which,
in point of fact, has to be resolved by every landlord who lets his land
on any other principle than the (in Ireland) ruinous one of competition.
I should say that the rent which a public arbitrator ought to consider a
fair one, is the highest which any respectable tenant, capitalist or
peasant, could afford to give, consistently with proper cultivation of
the land according to the standard of good farming received in the
country, and this, though difficult to define in general terms, could
certainly be determined with considerable accuracy in each particular
case, by an experienced land agent or manager, such as many in Ireland
are. What do you think of Campbell’s line of demarcation between
contract and status tenures? In case you have not seen the letter, I
transcribe the passage. “All agricultural tenures in which the landlord
has erected the necessary buildings and fences and made all the
considerable improvements, and in respect of which no practice of
selling the claims of the tenant or compensating him for loss of
occupancy exists, shall be distinguished as contract tenures, and shall
not be subject to the interference of the Commission. All other
agricultural holdings shall be designated Status tenures.”

I should very much regret not to be at the Club when your question is
discussed.6 I do not expect to be at the February meeting, and am not
certain about the March. I may say that the April meeting is the only
one this year at which I feel confident of being present.

The “Chapters and Speeches”7 will be out shortly. The reports of the
speeches are taken from Hansard. The first of the two, that of 1866, was
Edition: current; Page: [1668] printed verbatim from my MS. That of
1868, not being a written speech could not be given so exactly, but the
newspaper report was carefully corrected for Hansard by myself, and is
tolerably adequate.

The Tracy you speak of is the metaphysician Destutt-Tracy,8 and his
Political Economy forms one of the four volumes of his Idéologie,9 which
by an unlucky and rather strange chance I have never read, though I know
it to be worth reading. What are the merits of the political economy
portion I do not know. It is probably good for its time, but, I suppose,
behind hand now.

The news contained in your letter is indeed a subject of

further particulars about the Scholarships as soon as they are decided,
as we shd like to contribute a little towards them.

There is no harm, & some good, in any number of persons attending merely
for amusement provided that the lectures are not adapted for them but
for serious students. This would be very much guaranteed by the
lecturers’ holding some amount of examination at every lecture, as is
the practice, I believe, of the Scotch professors. This would have a
very good effect both on teachers & pupils, keeping before the minds of
both that serious work is intended. No one need be examined without her

Dear Sir,—

You have rightly judged that I should sympathize with an attempt to
raise the standard of free and unfettered discussion on religious as on
all other subjects; involving necessarily the same unlimited liberty of
disbelief as of belief. Whether that attempt is made by professing
Christians, or by persons who do not take that name, it is equally
welcome to me; so long as, whichever side they take, they are willing
and able to do justice, both logically and historically, to the other
side. There is nothing in your letter and Prospectus that tends to give
any other than a favorable idea of the spirit in which you have set
about your undertaking. But to come before the public as giving what
would be sure to be construed, however untruly, and however contrary to
your intention, as a kind of voucher or guarantee for the merits of the
projected newspaper, would, as it seems to me, be only suitable in those

beginnings, and helped it forward so vigorously in its early and most
difficult stages. You and Mrs Mott2 have well deserved to live to see
the cause in its present prosperity, and may now fairly hope to see a
commencement of victory in some of the States at least. I have received
many kind and cordial invitations to visit the United States, and were I
able, the great convention to which you invite me would certainly be a
strong inducement to do so. My dislike to a sea voyage would not of
itself prevent me, if there were not a greater obstacle—want of time. I
have many things to do yet, before I die, and some months (it is not
worth while going to America for less) is a great deal to give at my
time of life, especially as it would not, like ordinary travelling, be a
time of mental rest, but something very different. I regret my inability
the less, as the friends of the cause in America are quite able to
dispense with direct personal co-operation from England. The really
important co-operation is the encouragement we give one another by the
success of each in our own country. For Great Britain this success is
much greater than appears on the surface, for our people, as you know,
shrink much more timidly than Americans from attracting public notice to
themselves; and the era of great public meetings on this subject has not
arrived in our country, though it may be near at hand. I need hardly say
how much I am gratified by the mode in which my name was mentioned in
the National Convention at Newport, and still more at the tribute to the
memory of my dear wife,3 who from early youth was devoted to this cause,
and had done invaluable service to it as the inspirer and instructor of
others, even before writing the essay4 so deservedly eulogized in your
resolutions. To her I owe the far greater part of whatever I have myself
been able to do for the cause, for though from my boyhood I was a
convinced Edition: current; Page: [1671] adherent of it, on the ground
of justice, it was she who taught me to understand the less obvious
bearings of the subject, and its close connection with all the great
moral and social interests of the cause. I am, dear Madam, very
sincerely yours,

TO THE EMPLOYEES OF MESSRS. BREWSTER OF NEW YORK1

A[vignon]

Dec. 11, 1869

Dear Sirs—

I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of Nov. 12.

The plan of Industrial Partnerships seems to me highly worthy of
encouragement as uniting some of the advantages of cooperation with the
principal advantages of capitalist management. We should hope, indeed,
ultimately to arrive at a state of industry in which the workpeople as a
body will either themselves own the capital, or hire it from its owners.
Industrial Partnerships, however, are not only a valuable preparation
for that state, & transition to it, but might probably for a long time
exist by the side of it with great advantage; if only because their
competition would prevent cooperative associations of workmen from
degenerating, as I grieve to say they often do, into close joint stock
companies in which the workmen who founded them keep all the profits to
themselves.

The proposal of Messrs Brewster is in some important respects a
considerable improvement on the English Industrial Partnerships of which
I have any knowledge; because it takes the employés themselves into
council to determine the share of profit to which they shall be
admitted, instead of fixing its amount by the sole will of the
employers, and because it gives to a council elected by the employés, an
important share in the government of the workshops, even to the extent
of allowing them, by a two-thirds majority, to overrule the wishes of
the employers.

I have no such knowledge of the details of the subject as would enable
me to make any suggestions that it would be useful to you to receive.
But I will shew your letter & the printed plan of Messrs Brewster to
those of my friends who have more information on the subject & are more
capable of making Edition: current; Page: [1672] useful suggestions than
I am myself, especially Mr Hughes and Mr Ludlow, both of whom have had
an intimate connexion with Cooperation in England almost from its
infancy. Only one point in Messrs Brewster’s plan occurs to me as open
to criticism: that which provides that those who leave the employment
voluntarily shall forfeit their share of profits for the current year.
It seems to me that the Boards to whom so many other powers are
entrusted, might be the judges to decide whether in the particular
circumstances of each case the share of profit shd be forfeited or not.

Your questions2 did not by any means appear to me as absurd or trivial.
On the contrary, they shewed that you practise and require accuracy in a
matter of business. That three names of one family should be signed in
one handwriting is so common and so trifling a circumstance that nobody
is likely to notice it nor to draw any unfavourable inference from it if
noticed.

I hope you may be able to arrange with Mrs Fawcett to deliver a lecture
in your borough.3 She seems quite willing to do so if she can make it
accord with her arrangements.

The two copies of my little book4 would be extremely well bestowed on
the Libraries you mention, and I should have relied on your judgment had
you bestowed them without consulting me. If you would like any more
copies I shall be very happy to send them to you.

I do not know who is the Secretary of the Labour Representation League,5
but a note to Mr George Howell, 9 Buckingham Street, Strand, London W.C.
would probably procure for you that and any other information about the
League. He is perhaps himself the Secretary, and in any case, is sure to
know all about it.

I do not possess a copy of “Essays and Reviews”.6 My copy was lent many
years ago, and has not been returned to me. If I can procure it again
from the friend to whom I lent it, I will send it to you.

TO JOHN ELLIOT CAIRNES1

Jan. 11. 1870

Dear Mr Cairnes

The Pall Mall Gazette containing Mr Maine’s criticism of your article2
reached me duly. Though some of Mr Maine’s strong points come out in it,
on the whole it is hardly worthy of him. I need scarcely tell you that
what he principally objects to in your article constitutes in my eyes
its greatest value. I have never seen the ethical distinction between
property in land and in moveables so thoroughly and clearly worked out,
and the philosophical limits both of the property doctrine and of the
counter-doctrine so well stated. And though Maine goes along with the
practical conclusion, I am disappointed that he does not see the value
of this exposition, or that the conservative instinct is so strong in
him as to make him jealous of bringing the foundations of property under
discussion. Surely nothing can be more strange than one of his arguments
for abstaining from stirring up the subject, viz. that the present ideas
of property are wrong not in one direction only but in both, as witness
the disrespect for patent rights, and for copyright! Surely that is only
the more reason why the real foundations of the question should, instead
of should not, be insisted on.

It is a real and great pleasure to read such writing as yours. Very few
writers have a skill comparable to yours in making the exposition of
principles at once clear, persuasive, and attractive. With regard to the
practical conclusions of the article, Mr Campbell’s suggestions,3 with
your additions and modifications, are without doubt the utmost of what
there is any chance of obtaining at present from Parliament. The danger
is, as you observe, that we shall be put off with something far short of
this. If the plan is adopted, and gets into operation, no one will be
better pleased than I shall be. But I retain all my doubts whether, at
the point which Irish demands and expectations Edition: current; Page:
[1677] have now reached, any measure which makes the amount of rent and
the grounds of eviction in each individual case depend on the decision
of a public authority, can settle the question, or can possibly be
final. Every possible suspicion will be thrown on the intentions of the
Commission,4 and every possible hostile criticism will be made on its
decisions; and all whom it suffers to be evicted, or whom it requires to
pay an increase of rent, will think that they ought to have had fixity
of tenure at a valuation made once for all. But it is of no use
grumbling at the inevitable. Fixity of tenure cannot be carried at a
high step; and it is important that the intermediate measure should be
the best possible, as I think yours is.

I hope Courcelle Seneuil and Cherbuliez,5 which I had been too long in
sending, have long since reached you. I hope still more that your health
improves. It is already a great thing that so much of your working power
is restored. One can hardly exaggerate the value of minds which keep up
their thinking as time and events advance, instead of doing it all in
the first few years after entering into active life. There are too few
of them.

TO SIR ROBERT COLLIER1

A[vignon]

Jan. 11. 1870

My dear Sir,

I take the liberty of inclosing to you the newspaper report2 of a matter
in which I feel a painful interest & in which I am anxious to obtain the
aid of your influence towards mitigating the hardship of what seems to
me an extremely hard case. On the 24th of Decr a policeman named Wm
Smith was charged before Mr Benson3 the magistrate with an assault upon
a labouring man. The evidence proved that the policeman saw the man
Edition: current; Page: [1678] knock down a woman (his wife as it turned
out) in the street at one o’clock in the morning & interfered for her
protection, & in doing so, struck the man with his staff—which assault
on the man, Mr Benson said was “unprovoked, brutal & unjustifiable” &
sentenced the policeman to a month’s imprisonment & hard labour. I learn
from enquiries which I have since caused to be made, that the man,
though of unblemished character & 3½ years service has been dismissed
from the force & deprived of his livelihood.

Now the only thing in which this poor man had exceeded his duty—the only
point in which his conduct was not meritorious—was the blow with his
truncheon & in that he did what any man, not a police officer, might
justly have been proud of doing but which a policeman shd not have done
if he was able to take the man into custody by a less employment of
force; which however is uncertain, as the man was evidently in an
excited & violent state.

I am not a partisan of the police, on the contrary I greatly distrust
them & think that magistrates rely too much on their evidence & often
treat instances of bribery, perjury & other highly criminal conduct on
their part with most undue lenity. But on this very account, can there
be a worse lesson to the police or to the public, than that when so many
are retained in the force after flagrant misconduct one poor man against
whom there is no other charge is dismissed for a little excess of zeal
in protecting a woman against gross ill treatment? Policemen will think
twice before they will interfere again to protect men’s wives, or any
other women against brutality when they find that any hurt they inflict
on a brute of this description is declared from the seat of justice to
be not only “brutal & unjustifiable” but “unprovoked,” knocking down a
woman in the street being no provocation to a bystander, even to an
appointed & paid preserver of the peace—that in short a woman is a
creature whom it is safe to knock down but most dangerous to defend from
being knocked down by another man.

The policeman’s sentence will shortly expire & he will be released from
prison. Would it be impossible to prevail upon the Home Office to
restore him to the force? He has surely been punished enough for the
worst that he can be charged with—overzeal in the performance of an
important duty. I think it would be possible to get a well signed
Memorial presented to the Home Office, praying for his reinstatement;
but it would be better that it shd be done by the spontaneous act of the
Home Secretary,4 as it might perhaps be, if you would interest yourself
in the matter. I write by this post to Sir John Coleridge5 & Mr Russell
Gurney6 & would write to Mr Bruce if my acquaintance with him was
sufficient to warrant it.

TO FRANK HARRISON HILL1

Jan. 11. 1870

Dear Mr Hill

There is a subject in which I very much wish to interest you. It is a
police case, reported under the head of “Thames” in the Daily News of
Dec. 25. The policeman William Smith, who was sentenced by Mr Benson to
a month’s imprisonment with hard labour for, at the worst, using an
unnecessary degree of violence against a man whom he saw knock down a
woman in the street at one o’clock in the morning, has, as I have learnt
by private inquiry, been dismissed from the force and deprived of his
livelihood. The contrast between the manner in which perjury and other
gross criminality on the part of policemen are continually passed over
by magistrates, and this extreme severity for an act which would be
honourable to anybody but a policeman, and in him was nothing worse than
a slight excess of laudable zeal in the performance of a duty in which
the police are much oftener culpably remiss than overzealous, must make
a very great impression on the minds of policemen, who will learn from
it to be still more careful for the future how they interfere to protect
a woman from ill usage by a man. The magistrate had not a word of blame
for the brutal husband, but declared the blow struck by the constable to
be “unprovoked, brutal, and unjustifiable.” Be it observed that at the
time the policeman struck the blow, he probably did not even so much as
know that the woman was the wife of the man who was assaulting her but
simply interfered against a man who was in the act of knocking down a
woman in the public streets. As the poor man’s punishment is now drawing
to a close, if the Daily News would say something in favour of restoring
him to the force,2 it might greatly aid the attempt I am making to bring
influence to bear upon the Home Secretary for that purpose.

With our kind remembrances to Mrs Hill, I am

Jan. 11. 1870

Dear Sir—

I think you have done wisely in writing to Washington & in accepting the
correspondence of the New York Tribune. Will you pardon me for saying
that I think you are likely to be much sooner recognized as a man of
ability through what you may do in this last capacity, (if it suits you
to make yourself known as the writer) than by the profoundest
philosophical treatise that it is possible to write? because there are
so many more people competent to judge of the activity shewn. In some
respects even your larger works would have more chance of giving you a
reputation than the one you are now thinking of, since jurisprudence
being a special subject, a systematic work on any branch of it has to
some extent the advantage of being judged by experts, while Logic &
Method are at once everybody’s business & nobody’s.

I have no fault to find with the title of your proposed book.2 I think
it quite allowable either to treat Logic as coextensive with Method, or
Method as a whole of which Logic is a part: the latter is more
conformable to my own use of the words. But I am not nearly so confident
as you seem to be that I shall like your book. Ability it will not want,
nor system & concatenation: but I suspect that your “method” & mine are
radically different, & I gather from what you say that in order to agree
with your views, I shall have to abandon the greater part of my own. It
may be that you have made discoveries which supersede all previous
writers on logic from Aristotle downwards & change the whole face of the
subject: if so, you will probably be appreciated fifty years after your
death. You may have done all this, & I may not be able to see it: if I
do, I think I can depend upon myself for being ready to confess &
proclaim it; but even that would be but a very little way towards
success. Byron might rise one morning & find himself famous, but Byron
was a lord, & besides, what he wrote were trivialities which anybody
could understand: and when a lord or a rich man gets praised for his
writings it is not because of the means which his title or his wealth
gives him of making their merits known; the homage is to the title or
riches themselves, & he is praised as a writer because that is the form
of praise he is supposed to like. Publishers look only to the saleable:
there is little or no public for philosophical treatises (unless indeed
they can get into the Universities) & Edition: current; Page: [1681]
books of any profundity are now generally written by men who have other
occupations & means of subsistence & who, contented to get their books
into print, can wait any length of time for recognition. As regards
myself, unless I am completely converted to your views & become a
disciple, there is little that I can do to help you. Old & intimate
friends of my own whom both on personal & on public grounds I am most
desirous to assist, are unable to get their writings published. No
opinion from me will make a publisher think that a book on a dry subject
is saleable: but if you can make yourself, by other means, independent &
known, or even only independent, you may be able to risk it yourself &
try the chance.

I expect to be in England about the first week in March.

TO AN UNIDENTIFIED CORRESPONDENT1

Avignon

,
January 11 1870

The subject of your letter of the 3rd is one which I have much
considered, and in which I feel great interest, and the result of the
consideration is that I greatly deprecate any extension of the
Contagious Diseases Act,2 and should highly approve of its repeal. I do
not think the abuses of power by the police mere accidents which could
be prevented. I think them the necessary consequences of any attempt to
carry out such a plan thoroughly. If once examination is made other than
voluntary the police must try to prevent evasion of it, and this at once
opens the door to innocent mistakes on the part of the police, and makes
it necessary to entrust them with power over women which no men are fit
to have. I am opposed to the principle of the Act. I believe the medical
efficacy of it to be doubtful, and I believe it to be impossible to
carry it out without a degree of oppression which would more than
overbalance any advantages that could be gained. Of course, in saying
this, I look to the female population as well as the male, and strike
the balance of advantages to the whole. I may as well say that I think
this oppression does exist in France, and is responsible for a state of
things among all classes far worse than exists in England. Nor do I
think the indirect evils of this kind Edition: current; Page: [1682] of
registration to be despised. The interpretation certain to be put upon
regulations of this description, even if entirely false, is so
mischievous that a very great balance of well-ascertained practical good
effects would not, perhaps, be sufficient to compensate for it. To fancy
that calling this objection a sentimental one at all invalidates it is
merely childish, for, assuredly, men’s sentiments have a great deal to
do in regulating their conduct; and no law can be a good one which gives
a bad direction to men’s sentiments.

Mon cher M. Villari—

J’ai bien tardé à vous remercier de votre bonne lettre et des envois si
intéressants qui l’ont accompagnée. C’est que j’attendais pour avoir le
loisir de lire l’ouvrage de M. Gabelli,2 qui méritait évidemment une
lecture très sérieuse. J’ai fait enfin cette lecture et j’en suis bien
récompensé. Ce traité a tout le mérite qu’on devait attendre de la haute
opinion que vous avez de son auteur. Je suis charmé de voir arborer en
Italie le drapeau de la phychologie inductive et de la morale
utilitaire, dans un livre si fortement pensé et qui prête si peu à la
critique.

C’est en même temps un indice et une cause de progrès intellectuel, en
donnant aux principes du droit et de la morale une définition claire et
une base démontrable et en épargnant la déplorable déperdition de force
intellectuelle qui a lieu aujourd’hui pour une métaphysique nuageuse qui
ne mène à rien, parcequ’elle suppose toujours ce qui est en question, en
faisant du sentiment subjectif de l’homme sa propre justification. Votre
ami me paraît de force à lutter très vigoureusement contre cette
métaphysique et cela de la meilleure façon, en le remplissant par
quelque chose mieux. J’ajouterai qu’il Edition: current; Page: [1684]
raisonne et discute très bien: les mots ont toujours pour lui un sens
notamment déterminé et il sait toujours ce qu’il veut dire.

Je suis très content de vos circulaires sur l’instruction des femmes.
Ces circulaires sont très propres à stimuler le zèle des autorités
locales en leur faisant sentir l’importance que met le gouvernement à
l’instruction réelle et sérieuse des femmes. Ce que vous me dites par
leur retentissement et par l’effet que déjà elles produisent est très
encouragement. J’espère que le changement du ministère n’a rien changé
dans les dispositions du gouvernement à cet égard et n’a pas ébranlé
votre position officielle3 si précieuse au bien public.

Vous me demandez mes idées sur l’instruction des femmes, mais puisque
vous approuvez mon livre4 je crois que vous les connaissez déjà et que
ce sont les vôtres. Vous savez que je ne voudrais nulle distinction dans
l’instruction donnée aux deux sexes. Dans mon opinion l’instruction
générale doit être la même: quant à la professionnelle, elle dépendra de
la destination sociale de chaque élève, mais celle-là aussi doit être
ouverte aux jeunes filles comme aux jeunes gens. Je crois que l’on
finira par n’avoir que des écoles communes aux deux sexes. Après cela il
va sans dire que la connaissance du milieu social de l’Italie doit
décider de l’approche qu’il est aujourd’hui possible de faire à cet
idéal. Le plus grand danger à craindre c’est que tout en faisant faire
les mêmes études, on ne s’efforce pas à les faire faire aussi solides
par les jeunes filles; et qu’on se contente de quelque chose de plus
superficiel, ne visant guère qu’à l’amusement ou à l’agrément. Ce danger
cessera du moment où il sera compris que l’instruction des femmes est
tout aussi importante aux intérêts sociaux que celle des hommes. Dès que
cette idée-là se sera emparé des esprits, la cause sera gagnée. Et le
gouvernement fera déjà beaucoup de bien en faisant voir que c’est là son
intime conviction.

Vous me connaissez assez pour juger que je ne suis pas ému par ce qu’il
y a de peu satisfaisant dans la vie politique du moment en Italie. Ces
luttes d’ambition et d’amour propre sont réellement des phénomènes très
superficiels: et tout indique que les mouvements intellectuels et
économiques se poursuivent très heureusement sous cette surface. C’est
sur ces deux mouvements que tout renseignement venant de vous me serait
précieux. A propos, les documents sur Rome que vous avez eu la
complaisance d’envoyer n’étaient pas ce dont j’avais besoin: Je croyais
que comme en France un exposé général de l’état, surtout économique du
pays, se publiait tous les ans, et je voulais y chercher principalement
des renseignements sur l’émigration. Au reste le besoin momentané que
j’avais de ces renseignements est passé.5

Dear Chapman

I am much obliged to you for your interesting letter on the Colonial
question, and all the more, as your early departure2 will prevent me
from having any opportunity of talking over with you the new aspects of
the subject.

The causes you mention are, no doubt, those which have chiefly
contributed to the indifference of official people in England about
retaining the colonies. I suspect that separation would still be a great
shock to the general English public, though they justly dislike being
taxed for the maintenance of the connexion. For my own part, I think a
severance of it would be no advantage, but the contrary, to the world in
general, and to England in particular; and though I would have the
colonies understand that England would not oppose a deliberate wish on
their part to separate, I would do nothing to encourage that wish,
except telling them that they must be at the charge of any wars of their
own provoking, and that though we should defend them against all enemies
brought on them by us, in any other case we should only protect them in
a case of extremity such as is not at all likely to arise. I have always
thought, however, that we ought to have softened the transition in the
case of New Zealand by guaranteeing a loan to enable the colony to
maintain for a few years a sufficient force of its own raising, without
taking away the industrious population from the labours on which the
very existence of the colony depends.

I do not see my way to any practicable mode of federal government for
communities so widely scattered over the world. And I have attended
sufficiently to colonial affairs to be aware that the colonies will not
allow us to cast out our paupers into them. But emigration of able
bodied agricultural labourers who are not paupers, I suppose they would
welcome, and this would be very useful to us. Our having given up the
unoccupied lands to the colonial government creates many difficulties. I
thought, at the time, that it was an error; that the lands ought to have
been regarded as the common inheritance of the whole people, the United
Kingdom and the colonies taken together; the first comers having no just
claim to the exclusive disposal of more than they could themselves
occupy. But in this matter, jacta est alea, and we have only to make the
best arrangement we can with the colonists for the reception of such
emigrants as they are willing to take.

Dear Madam—

I have delayed very long to thank you for kindly sending me your book2
the reason being that I have only just now found time to read it.
Nothing can be more laudable than your purpose in writing the book—that
of inspiring greater respect for the people of India in the minds of
those who are appointed to govern them. That respect for the most part
exists in the experienced men who know the natives from a long course of
service in India; but nothing can be more disgusting than the feelings &
demeanour towards them of numbers of the raw young Englishmen who go out
& I am afraid this is an increasing evil since the substitution of the
Queen’s army3 who detest the country and only remain a few years in it,
for a force Edition: current; Page: [1687] of which the officers passed
their whole career in India, & since the great increase of private
adventurers, who are not even under that imperfect control from
superiors to which the military, & the civil officers of government are
subject.

I think you have done good service by putting within reach of the
English public, in the compass of a single work, so much knowledge, both
in the shape of information & of specimens, of the thoughts &
intellectual productions of the Hindoos. Opinions will differ as to the
merits of these productions, & of the state of civilization which they
indicate; but they are an authentic & interesting product of the human
mind; they deserve to be known, & any one may now know where to find
such a selection from them as is sufficient to give a correct general
notion of their kind & quality. This could not, as far as I know, have
been obtained before, without at least dipping into many books.

You ask me for information respecting the administrative capacity shown
by so many ladies of ruling families in India & especially whether these
ladies are Hindoos or Mahomedans. They are almost all Hindoos. The case
can seldom arise in a Mussulman principality, as by Mahomedan law the
mother is not regent for her minor son, whereas among Hindoos the mother
by birth or adoption is regent of right. One of the most remarkable
however of these ladies, the late Sekunder Begum of Bhopal,4 was a
Mahomedan. She was the only child of the ruler of the country, & at his
death, according to the custom of the people she could transmit the
chiefship to her husband but could not exercise it herself: she was
however so much the stronger mind & the most popular too that the people
obeyed her in preference to her husband & after his death which was an
early one she was allowed to govern the country at first nominally for
her daughter, but latterly in her own right. She was a most energetic,
prudent, & just ruler, & her daughter who has now succeeded her, & who
has been carefully trained by her to public business, is expected to
tread in her footsteps. Her own mother too was a remarkable woman. As
the Native States were in my department at the India House I had
opportunities of knowing all that was known about the manner in which
they were governed & during many years by far the greater number of
instances of vigorous frugal & skilful administration which came to my
knowledge were by Ranees and Raees as regents for minor chiefs.

My daughter has not yet had time to read your book, but she looks
forward to doing so with pleasure & begs to be kindly remembered to you.

Dear Sir—

I do not feel entitled to proffer my opinion unasked to Mr Odger on a
point on which you say he has not made up his mind, & I do not like to
urge upon him any particular course of action during his canvass,2
supposing that I knew he agreed with me in opinion. No one has taken a
warmer interest than I have in the candidatures of working men in
general & Mr Odger in particular, & I believe Mr O. is well aware of
this.

Not only do I object altogether to the extension of the C[ontagious]
D[iseases] Acts,3 but I have seen the passing of them as they at present
exist with great regret & shd be extremely rejoiced if they could be
repealed: since not only do I object to them altogether on principle but
I think that in the long run those measures are likely rather to
increase than diminish the evil they are intended to attack. Moreover I
fully agree with you in thinking that opposition to those Acts is more
particularly incumbent on the defenders of the interests of working men,
because working women are likely to be the greatest sufferers by this
system of legislation & if it is to be carried out with anything like
efficiency it could only be by an enormous expenditure which of course
would fall in the long run upon the great mass of the taxpayers. Of
course one need scarcely say that to any man who looks upon political
institutions & legislation from the point of view of principle the idea
of keeping a large army in idleness & vice & then keeping a large army
of prostitutes to pander to their vices is too monstrous to admit of a
moment’s consideration, while the safety of the country could be
provided for by the military education of all classes, or until after
every possible experiment with married soldiers had been tried & failed.
I therefore do not think that this system of legislation which I think
utterly depraving to the mass of the population (not to speak of its
gross inequality between men & women) is in any way specially necessary
for the army & navy. It is a monstrous artificial cure for a monstrous
artificial evil which had far better be swept away at its root in
accordance with democratic principles of government.

I do not wish to write anything at length or to print anything on the
subject, Edition: current; Page: [1689] as I have great hopes that any
further extension of these Acts will be checked by the public spirited
action of the Ladies Committees, & I believe that full discussion of the
subject will lead to bringing public opinion to our side in regard even
to the repeal of the Acts. But if you would like to shew this letter to
Mr Odger, or to any friend, I shd have no objection at all to your doing
so.

Dear Sir:

I beg to acknowledge your letter of Nov. 21.

I think you must have been misinformed as to the purport of the letter
which I addressed, on the 23d of October, to a California citizen who
had asked my opinion on the subject of the Chinese immigration.2 I
certainly said that the settlement, in large numbers, of a population in
a lower state of civilization, and willing to work for a lower rate of
remuneration, would have a tendency to deteriorate the condition of the
native laborer for wages, and would, so far, on general principles,
justify restraints on immigration; but I urged, as a greatly preferable
course, to endeavor, by education, to raise the Chinese population to
the level of the American; and it is with great pleasure I learn from
your letter that this is already being attempted with some success. The
only measure of distinction which I did advocate was the enforcement of
stringent laws against introducing Chinese under contract to work for
particular persons; which is a form of compulsory labor—that is, of
slavery. I should greatly deprecate the institution of a Chinese for an
American population in all the departments of manual labour, the Chinese
remaining what they are; but I distinctly stated in my letter that so
long, at least, as the bulk of the immigrants return eventually to their
own country, the opportunity given to numerous Chinese of becoming
familiar with better and more civilized habits of life is one of the
best chances that can be opened up for the improvement of the Chinese in
their own country, and one which it does not seem to me that it would be
right to withhold from them.

I am, dear Sir, yours, very faithfully,

The American Social Science Association will do immense service if it
makes itself an organ for stimulating the desire and obtaining the means
of the highest possible education. Stimulating the desire is all that is
needed for obtaining the means, for there are never wanting, in your
country, generous men who give large sums to enrich their country with
permanent institutions which they think useful to it. When opinion shall
have been duly prepared, persons will probably be found who will be
disposed to endow Professorships of Jurisprudence and Roman Law at
Harvard College and the other Universities.

What you say about the new start which the mind of America has been led
to make by her long and arduous struggle, is exactly what I foresaw from
Edition: current; Page: [1691] almost the very beginning. I wrote in
January, 1862, and often said in the years following, that, if the war
lasted long enough, it would very likely regenerate the American
people,2 and I have been seeing more and more clearly since it closed,
that to a considerable extent it has really done so, and in particular,
that reason and right feeling on any public subject has a better chance
of being favorably listened to, and of finding the national mind open to
comprehend it, than at any previous time in American history. This great
benefit will probably last out the generation which fought in the war;
and all depends on making the utmost use of it, for good purposes,
before the national mind has time to get crusted over with any fresh set
of prejudices as nations so quickly do.

TO LORD AMBERLEY1

Avignon

Feb. 2. 1870

Dear Lord Amberley

Mr Lecky’s2 state of mind on the subject of prostitution is
characteristically conservative. He thinks that since it has not been
reformed up to this day it never can be. This is the true conservative
stand point. Whatever reforms have been already effected are well
enough; if they were effected long enough ago, they are even excellent.
As to any reforms in the future, though they might be desirable in
themselves, they are sure to bring with them greater evils than they can
remove; and then come those jeremiads more or less eloquent and
touching, which we are so accustomed to in politics and morals, about
the fearful consequences to society of attempting to do anything that
has not been done already. It would be hardly possible to support any
opinion by flimsier reasons than these particular ones of Mr Lecky. Are
we to consider what the Church accomplished in the middle ages as the
extreme limit of the moral improvement possible to mankind? Are the
violent appetites and passions of half-tamed, or not even half-tamed,
barbarians, a measure of the obstacles to be encountered in educating
the young of a cultivated and law-observing community? The Church strove
with sincerity and earnestness in the middle ages to suppress private
war and the abuses of military violence, with very little success; but
what could not be done then, has been found quite practicable since, and
has been actually accomplished.

It is of more importance, however, to consider Mr Lecky’s doctrine than
his reasons. He considers prostitution as a safety valve to prevent the
propensity to which it ministers from producing worse evils.3 Now, in
the first place, I believe that the propensity has hitherto been
fostered, instead of being weakened, by the tendencies of civilisation
(which has been a civilisation left mainly to the influence of men) and
by the teaching of the Catholic Edition: current; Page: [1693] Church,
which in order to add to the glory of the ‘grace of God,’ always has
exaggerated and still does exaggerate the force of the natural passions.
I think it most probable that this particular passion will become with
men, as it is already with a large number of women, completely under the
control of the reason. It has become so with women because its becoming
so has been the condition upon which women hoped to obtain the strongest
love and admiration of men. The gratification of this passion in its
highest form, therefore, has been, with women, conditional upon their
restraining it in its lowest. It has not yet been tried what the same
conditions will do for men. I believe they will do all that we wish, nor
am I alone in thinking that men are by nature capable of as thorough a
control over these passions as women are. I have known eminent medical
men, and lawyers of logical mind, of the same opinion.

But, in the second place, supposing that Mr Lecky is right in thinking,
as he apparently does, that men are not capable of efficient control
over this propensity, I should still differ from him when he thinks that
prostitution is the best safety valve. I, on the contrary, think that
with the exception of sheer brutal violence, there is no greater evil
that this propensity can produce than prostitution. Of all modes of
sexual indulgence, consistent with the personal freedom and safety of
women, I regard prostitution as the very worst; not only on account of
the wretched women whose whole existence it sacrifices, but because no
other is anything like so corrupting to the men. In no other is there
the same total absence of even a temporary gleam of affection and
tenderness; in no other is the woman to the man so completely a mere
thing used simply as a means, for a purpose which to herself must be
disgusting. Moreover so far from thinking with Mr Lecky that
prostitution is a safeguard even to the virtuous women, I think it cuts
at the core of happiness in marriage, since it gives women a feeling of
difference and distance between themselves and their husbands, and
prevents married people from having frank confidence in one another. The
fact I believe to be, that prostitution seems the only resource to those
and to those only, who look upon the problem to be solved to be, how to
allow the greatest license to men consistently with retaining a
sufficient reserve or nursery of chaste women for wives. Their problem
is not, as yours and mine is, how to obtain the greatest amount of
chastity and happiness for men, women, and children. Marriage has not
had a fair trial. It has yet to be seen what marriage will do, with
equality of rights on both sides; with that full freedom of choice which
as yet is very incomplete anywhere, and in most countries does not exist
at all on the woman’s side; and with a conscientious scruple, enforced
by opinion, against giving existence to more children than can be done
justice to by the parents. When marriage under these conditions (and
with such means of legal relief in extreme cases as may be adopted when
men and women have Edition: current; Page: [1694] an equal voice) shall
have been tried and failed, it will be time to look out for something
else: but that this something else, whatever it may be, will be better
than prostitution, is my confirmed conviction.

We are sorry that you have had such deplorable weather during your whole
stay in Italy. The winter seems to have been a bad one over the whole
South. There has been snow all round us; Perpignan, Narbonne, Bezius,
have been snowed up. We have had none here; but instead of our glorious
winter days (of which, until quite lately, there have been only a few)
cold northwest winds, with clouds and haze almost like England. This
ungenial weather has disagreed both with my daughter and me: she has
been not nearly so well as when you saw her, and I have had a series of
small ailments, and have still an obstinate cold.

Shall you be in England in April? The Women’s Suffrage Committee would,
I believe, prefer to hold their meeting in April, but if you could not
be present then, would postpone it till June. Would you mind writing to
ask Mr Winterbotham4 to speak at the meeting? either in April or in
June, according as you are yourself able to be present.

I inclose introductions to M. Jules Simon and M. Louis Blanc: the latter
of whom, however, lives in England, and we hope you will meet him at our

Dear Lord Amberley

I should have plenty to say both on Mr Lecky’s further remarks2 and on
your difficulties; but having just found your letter on returning from a
five days excursion I write hastily for the chance of finding you still
at Florence. I will therefore merely throw out a few hints. I see no
proof of the difference of physical constitution you suppose to exist
between men and women as to Edition: current; Page: [1695] the point in
question. From all I have read or heard I believe that there are no
signs of it among savages: and the Hindoo books talk perpetually of the
unrestrainable voluptuousness of women. I rather think the difference is
merely that the masters, being more accustomed to indulge all their
propensities than the subjected, find them more imperative and
uncontrollable. So much for Mr Lecky’s “heroic standard of virtue.” With
Mr Lecky I am entirely at issue as to prostitution being the least bad
form of illicit sexuality. I think it by far the most degrading and the
most mischievous. On the whole I would rather you did not shew my letter
to Mr Lecky.

We are very sorry to hear that you are going to lose a place which you
like, and to have the great trouble of looking out for another.3 We will
inform the Women’s Suffrage Committee of the limits within which your
ability to attend the meeting will be confined. Many thanks for writing
to Mr Winterbotham.4 I do not know how he reconciles his not having yet
made up his mind to the suffrage, with “hearty adhesion to the
principles” of the book on the Subjection of Women. “The question of
careers and of political rights” will settle that of education much
sooner than the latter the former; and this he will probably find out.
Meanwhile, and independently of losing him as a speaker at the meeting

Dear Sir—

I presume I am indebted to you for sending me the number of the Chicago
Tribune which commented on my supposed opinions respecting Chinese
immigration.2 Nothing could be clearer or fairer than the editorial
Edition: current; Page: [1696] statement of the reasons which in my
opinion might justify the exclusion of immigrant labourers of a lower
grade of civilisation than the existing inhabitants. But I never said
that in America & in the present circumstances of the case it ought to
be done. My letter on the subject to a Californian citizen3 who had
asked my opinion, has been so much misunderstood that I cannot but think
the copy of my letter which I understand appeared in the newspaper must
have been a mutilated one. I distinctly declared that in my opinion the
right course to be adopted is to endeavour by education to bring the
rising generation of Chinese up to the level of Americans. If there is
little or no rising generation (the Chinese not being permanent
settlers) I said that in that case their coming could be no such evil to
the labouring classes as to justify its prohibition, while the
opportunity it gives of carrying the ideas of a more civilised country
into the heart of China, is an advantage to the people of China of which
(I said) I do not think it would be right to deprive them. The only mode
of immigration which I said that I thought shd be prohibited is the
bringing over Chinese as Coolies under engagements to work for
particular persons; which is a form of compulsory labour, or in other
words of slavery.

Many thanks for the trouble you have taken to give information to Mr
Watson.4 I have since heard that the American Soc Sc. Assn has taken up
the subject,5 so that I hope a considerable amount of valuable
information is likely to result from Mr Watson’s inquiries.

Although you have not been successful, I congratulate you on the result
of the polling in Southwark, as it proves that you have the majority of
the Liberal party with you,2 and that you have called out an increased
amount of political feeling in the borough. It is plain that the Whigs
intend to monopolise political power as long as they can without
coalescing in any degree with the Radicals. The working men are quite
right in allowing Tories to get into the House to defeat this exclusive
feeling of the Whigs, and may do it without sacrificing any principle.
The working men’s policy is to insist upon their own representation, and
in default of success to permit Tories to be sent into the House until
the Whig majority is seriously threatened, when, of course, the Whigs
will be happy to compromise, and allow a few working men representatives
in the House.

I cannot help thinking St. James’s Hall too large for the meeting,2
unless you mean the smaller room there. I look with great misgiving
Edition: current; Page: [1698] upon a meeting at all this year, as the
promises are as yet so few. You have not told us whom you think of
asking to speak. I think the second meeting3 in some respects more
critical than the first, because many who have heard of the success of
the first will come, & it will be mischievous if they go away
disappointed. I cannot pledge myself to speak & I do not see a prospect
of a successful meeting, whether I speak or not, unless Mr Maurice & Mr
Cairnes consent. I do not see, without them, enough speakers of the
first class. Will you kindly let us know for what day the 2d reading of
the bill is fixed;4 & Helen asks me to say that she cannot write to Miss
Hare5 until you answer her question whether you would like Miss Hare to
read the report of the year’s proceedings in the place of Miss Biggs,6
as you suggested that some one shd do when we last saw you. You do not
tell us what lady speakers you think of asking. Helen says that if there
were no other lady speakers than yourself & Mrs Fawcett, she would do
her utmost to try to speak herself, & thinks that probably her doing so
might help to induce Miss Hare: but unfortunately she cannot promise, as
she cannot depend with certainty on her health. Still we think that few
lady speakers are better than having any who are not all that could be
desired. I must reiterate my objection to St. James’s Hall because I
think that even if it could be filled (which is doubtful) it would have
too much the appearance of a public meeting. I shd have thought Willis’
Room quite large enough.

We have not yet fixed when we shall leave here, but will be in England
for the meeting whenever it may be. In a letter7 received yesterday from

25th would suit Lord A. best.

Dear Mr Cairnes

It would be of the utmost value to the meeting of the Women’s Suffrage
Society, and a great service to the cause, if you could find it possible
to say a few words at the meeting.2 I know that it is asking very much
from you, but in a case like this the second meeting is the most
critical of all, especially after the first has been successful. Even if
it is as good a meeting as the first, there will seem to be a falling
off, because more will be expected: but to have the same speakers over
again, with hardly any new ones, or with such only as add little to our
strength, would be more than a falling off—it would be a failure. And so
many of our best supporters came to the front last year, that there is
considerable danger of failure from this cause. You, however, are part
of our reserved strength: your name, and even a very brief expression of
your sentiments, would add weight to the meeting. It is this extreme
need which makes me hope that if it be possible, you will consent to
speak a few sentences. However few they are, they will be of the
greatest service, and I do not venture to ask for more.

My daughter says she shall be more an enemy of hunting than ever now
that she knows your loss of health is partly due to it.3 She is very
much gratified at your good opinion of her article,4 as there is no one
whose favourable judgment she would regard more highly. She is very
anxious to see your Edition: current; Page: [1702] additions to your
Logic of Political Economy,5 as she had felt tempted to controvert part
of it in something she was writing, but which she has laid aside until
she knows your present views on the subject.

I agree with you that the land ought to belong to the nation at large,
but I think it will be a generation or two before the progress of public
intelligence and morality will permit so great a concern to be entrusted
to public authorities without greater abuses than necessarily attach to
private property in land. Meanwhile we should try to go on limiting the
power of individuals over land by imposing more and more conditions on
behalf of the people at large.

Dear Sir,—

I most heartily agree with the Resolution of the London Branch,2 which I
had already seen in the newspapers, and I am delighted that the
Education League is preparing for a struggle. For myself I would rather,
and I should think that the intelligent part of the working class would
Edition: current; Page: [1703] rather have no National Education Act for
the next five years, than one which should empower the State to
establish schools on the denominational principle. All other objections,
strong as some of them are, might be waived in order to get a beginning
made of a national system; but that all schools founded by the
Government, either general or local, should be purely secular is a point
on which if I were in Parliament I would make no compromise, but if it
was not conceded, would do what I could to defeat the Bill. Ever since I
saw that the League was going to make a stand on this point I have been
desirous of helping it by some expression of opinion, but I have not yet
made up my mind how I can best do so.3 I rather dislike writing private
letters to be published in the newspapers, of which there has been a
great deal in my case already without my consent.

With regard to an International Free Trade Congress,4 I do not clearly
understand whom in particular it is hoped to influence by it—the English
working people, or foreign countries. If the latter, it would probably
do good, provided it proceeded mainly from the foreign free traders. I

Dear Madam—

I beg to return you my sincere thanks for your kindly sending me your
excellent series of letters on the Women question.2 It is a real honour
to have my name inscribed at the beginning of such a volume. Your book
is both convincing & persuasive & is singularly free from the two
contrary defects one or other of which writings for the cause of woman
so often exhibit, of indiscreet violence & timid concession.

So competent a testimony as yours is well fitted to make me think that I
have been at least apparently unjust to German women in the remark I
made Edition: current; Page: [1704] in my little book on the
insufficiency of their education.3 When I referred to this as being
inferior to what it is in France I did not so much refer to the ordinary
character of the schools for young women which I believe is much worse
in France than in Germany, but to the much smaller number of women who,
like yourself & a few others, have qualified themselves by their studies
& acquirements for distinction & usefulness as writers. The average
education of German ladies may be much superior (at least as to
languages) to that of French ladies but there appears to be as yet a
much smaller number who stand out from the general level & take a more
or less high rank either in the literature or in the serious discussions
of their country.

Dear Mr Cairnes

I hardly know how to express to you how much I feel the kindness of your
consenting to speak in compliance with my wishes,2 though so much in
opposition to your own. Had your unwillingness been grounded solely on
your health, I would on no account have urged you against your own
preference: but since it has its source in that too modest estimate of
yourself, of which your friends have ample experience, I think they may
fairly do what I should not advise them to do on most subjects—set their
judgment above your own. I have not the slightest misgiving about your
speaking, if but you do speak. It is only your health I am anxious
about, and on that point your letter is encouraging. I beg that you will
say only as much as can be said without overtasking your physical
powers. However short your speech may be, I will answer for its being
both a help and a credit to the meeting.

My daughter found, as I did myself, much to admire, as well as to learn
from, in your Logic of Political Economy. As for your last article in
the Fortnightly,3 she is even more enthusiastic in her admiration of it
than I am, and thinks it one of the finest bits of writing in the
English language; an absolute model of philosophical exposition in the
balance and proportion of the parts.

My dear Sir Robert Collier—

Allow me to thank you for your kind attention to my letter, & for the
interest you have taken in the case of the dismissed policeman.2

I shd think more of the reason assigned by Mr Bruce for not reinstating
the man if it were one that is consistently acted on by the police
authorities. But there have been not a few cases in which magistrates
have shown by their decision that they entirely disbelieved the
testimony of policemen, either given to screen themselves or one another
or in wrongful accusation of other people; yet so far as the public are
aware, dismissal has not followed. I inclose a case which I have read
this very day in the Daily News,3 where an inspector who had been
dismissed for a grossly insulting abuse of authority towards two
respectable women got himself restored by making statements privately
against their character which statements having inadvertently become
public he has been obliged publicly to retract. This is surely a much
worse case of disregard of truth than that which Wm Smith is charged
with. If this inspector remains in the force, it will be thought, & said
that falsehood may be overlooked in a policeman who insults women but is
unpardonable in one who defends them.

Undoubtedly if the man has really been guilty of falsehood he ought not
to be reinstated: but that he persists in his story is all he can do if
he is innocent. Of course in a case like this in which the magistrate
has shewn such gross Edition: current; Page: [1706] incapacity there
ought to be some independent examination of the worth of the evidence of
the witness whose story was at variance with that of the man Smith. I
shd have supposed that it would have been within the province of the
head of the police to have made such an examination: for however much
respect is due to a magistrate’s decision magistrates are after all
fallible (unhappily in the case of Mr Benson apparently very fallible) &
then it seems to lie with the Home Secy & the immediate superiors of any
one who has been aggrieved to redress the injury as well as they can in
the absence of any Court of Appeal.

I hope you have by this time quite recovered from your unfortunate &
troublesome accident which I much regretted to hear of.

Dear Mr Leslie—

I am truly sorry to hear that your indisposition has been so painful &
so serious. It is well that the worst is past, and that you are rapidly
recovering.

Edition: current; Page: [1707]
I am much obliged to you for writing out so clearly & well the best
things which can be said against the repeal of the Contagious Diseases
Acts.2 Much of what you say is in itself just: but considered as an
argument in support of the Acts, I think I could answer every part of
it; & some time or other I hope to do so.

The Ladies’ Manifesto3 supports its case in a manner which though well
calculated for effect on a great number of minds, does not bear being
brought to a strict logical test. Nevertheless it appears to me that the
fault is not so much in the arguments as in the mode of putting them &
that they might be so stated as not to be open to the criticisms which
they have, naturally enough, suggested to you.

What will probably go farther in influencing the public mind than any
argument is that the facts relied on by the supporters of the Acts are
breaking down under them in all directions, & that their claim to have
nearly all medical opinion on their side is showing itself to be utterly
futile.

I have just seen the advertisement of your book4 in Longmans’ list. It
is not worth while sending any proofs here as we leave for England at

Dear Mr Helps—

Your letter was forwarded to me at Avignon but I delayed acknowledging
it until I shd have an opportunity of reading your book2 which was
waiting for me here.

If, as you intimate, my review of your first publication3 had any share
in procuring for the world the series of works which I & so many others
have since read with so much pleasure & instruction; far from regarding
this exploit of mine as a sin to be repented of, I should look upon it
as a fair set off against a good many sins. This most recent of your
works is as full of valuable & happily expressed thoughts as any of its
predecessors, while as a story it is more successful than Realmah4
though perhaps not more interesting to a psychologist. With regard to
its practical object, emigration, I shd like very much to see the
experiment tried in the manner you propose, of founding beyond the seas
a new community complete in all its parts. But the Edition: current;
Page: [1710] conditions of a new country produce of necessity a state of
society so much more democratic than our own, that it is only very
exceptional persons in our higher and middle classes that could either
reconcile themselves to it or have the foresight & mental adaptability
required for guiding & organising the formation of such a community. And
considering the great addition made annually to the poorer part of our
population, the scheme would have to be executed on a vast scale indeed
if it is to clear out the bad quarters of our towns & leave them a
tabula rasa for reconstruction on better principles; not to say that the
inhabitants of those quarters are far from being, in general, good
material to colonise with.

I am very happy that you go so far as you do with those who are seeking
to remove the civil & political disabilities of women. Since you think
women shd have the suffrage, surely you shd join the Suffrage Society
which claims nothing whatever but that independent women with a due
property qualification shd be allowed to vote.

you. I know too well that there is no consolation for a calamity like
yours. But nothing can deprive you of what comfort there is in a
knowledge of the deep respect which was felt for your husband & will
continue to be felt by his memory, by those who have known him as long &
as well as I have. Mr Hickson was one of the small number of those who,
with no personal ambition to gratify have laboured from an early age
first to acquire the powers necessary for enabling them to render
services to mankind, & then to use those powers to the utmost extent of
their opportunities, & he was in no ordinary degree, successful in both
objects. I have from an early period been accustomed to look upon him as
in many important respects an example of what men should be. The loss of
every such man makes the world poorer, & is to be lamented even by those
who had not the privilege of his personal friendship—how much more by
all who had.

Monsieur—

Je suis bien aise d’apprendre que je n’avais pas négligé de vous envoyer
le livre de mon père.2 Ce livre parut dans le moment le plus extrême de
la réaction soi-disant spiritualiste, et il y a manqué par là un
éclatant succès tout en contribuant beaucoup à former un certain nombre
de bons esprits. Réimprimé dans un temps plus propice à la philosophie
inductive de la nature humaine, il tendra à fortifier cette bonne
tendance, sans jeter ses lecteurs dans les défauts que vous reprochez
avec quelque raison à l’école matérialiste.

Quant à la question des femmes;3 vous n’êtes pas le premier qui m’a fait
à peu près les mêmes observations sur le caractère des françaises. J’ai
été souvent Edition: current; Page: [1713] frappé de l’espèce de mépris
avec lequel les français parlent souvent des françaises, et (puis-je le
dire?) il me semble que les françaises ne manquent pas de rendre ce
mépris même avec intérêt. Il est sûr que les hommes et les femmes en
France ne s’estiment pas réciproquement; ce qui est, par parenthèse,
assez souvent la conséquence de trop de galanterie dans les moeurs.
Cependant j’ose dire que comme beaucoup de français et surtout de
Parisiens et surtout encore des hommes de la classe aisée, vous ne
connaissez pas toutes les belles qualités des françaises. Il n’y a pas
au monde de femme qui sache mieux “s’ennuyer, sans s’amortir ou
s’éteindre” que la française provinciale rangée et vertueuse de quelque
rang que ce soit, et il n’y a pas de meilleure femme d’affaire ni de
personne plus réfléchie, plus sobre (d’esprit) que les paysannes
françaises, et encore beaucoup de femmes de la classe artisane quand
elles ne sont pas trop écrasées par les souffrances dont leur maris les
abreuvent. Et même pour les jolies femmes et les Parisiennes, c’est un
peu la légèreté des hommes français qui est cause que les femmes
françaises ne leur présentent que les côtés fourbes de leur caractère.
Quand ces mêmes femmes d’apparence frivole ont à faire avec des femmes
anglaises, il arrive quelquefois qu’elles font voir un fonds de sérieux
et d’amertume que se trouverait rarement peut-être même parmi ces
Anglaises que vous croyez si sérieuses. Ce caractère sympathique qui est
si gracieux, si aimable et dans les français et dans les françaises,
fait que les femmes se montrent banales et frivoles quand elles croient
voir que les hommes attendent d’elles la banalité et la frivolité. C’est
à vous hommes intelligents de la France, à montrer que vous croyez les
femmes capables des idées sérieuses et des goûts élevés, et je me trompe
beaucoup si vous ne verrez pas bientôt se dévoiler une intelligence et
une élévation dont vous ne soupçonnez pas encore l’existence.

TO JULIE VICTOIRE DAUBIÉ1

[
Spring? 1870

]

Mademoiselle:

You have a right to be surprised at the delay in my answer to your
letter. But your book2 is not one of those which one is content to read
in haste, and some time passed before the pressure of my occupations
permitted me to devote to it the time and attention which it deserved.

You have written a work, Mademoiselle, of great value, and all the more
meritorious that it must have been very painful to write it. I have
rarely read a more sad book. One has never, I believe, revealed in
fuller detail the miseries of life for the great majority of women, and
the revolting injustices of masculine society with respect to them. I
should like it if this book were to be read from beginning to end by all
men and women of the so-called enlightened class. I believe that it
would make many of them ashamed of their culpable inaction in face of
evils so frightful and injustices so monstrous.

Unfortunately, France is far from having on this question the bad
preeminence which you attribute to it. Social reformers are always
inclined to believe that other countries are better than their own.
Unhappily, the difference is very often more apparent than real. In many
passages you give an amount of praise to England on the subject in
question which it is far from deserving; and those who in England uphold
the cause of women often Edition: current; Page: [1715] pretend in their
turn that their condition is much better in France. Unhappily, both
deceive themselves.

As to the commencement which has been made here in the regulation of
prostitution, and which some are endeavoring to extend, your book would
suffice to condemn it without appeal. An association of women, some of
whom are very distinguished, has been formed to excite opinion against
this deplorable system.3 They are heartily seconded by men, and there is
reason to hope not only that the upholders of the system will not
venture to go further, but that they will be obliged to undo what they
have done.

Accept, Mademoiselle, the expression of my high and respectful
consideration.

Avignon

,
1st May 1870

Dear Madam,—

You greatly overrate the qualities required for writing such books as
mine, if you deem them to include that of being a competent adviser and
director of consciences in the most difficult affairs of private life.
And even a person qualified for this office would be incapable of
fulfilling it unless he possessed an intimate knowledge of the
circumstances of the case, and the character of the persons concerned.
It would be a long and a difficult business to define, even in an
abstract point of view, the cases which would justify one of two married
persons in dissolving the contract without the consent of the other. But
as far as I am able to judge from your own statement, yours does not
appear to be a strong case, since your husband has still an affection
for you, and since you not only do not complain of any ill treatment at
his hands, but have so much confidence in his goodness and high feeling,
as to feel sure that even in case of your leaving him without his
consent, he would not seek to withhold any of your children from you.

If I could venture to give any opinion, it would be that if the only bar
between you and such a man is a difference in your “ways of thinking and
feeling,” unfortunate as such a difference is in married life, the
mutual toleration which we all owe to those who sincerely differ from us
forms a basis on which the continuance of your union may be made
endurable, and the differences themselves, when nothing is done to
exasperate them, may, as is usually the case between persons who live
intimately together, tend gradually to an approximation.

TO SIR CHARLES WENTWORTH DILKE1

May 10. 1870

Dear Sir Charles Dilke

I suppose Fawcett will attend the General Meeting of the Committee of
the Land Reform Association in July, when his difficulties can be
considered, and probably met. Nobody who had any hand in the programme
had the smallest wish that cooperative cultivation should be under any
control of Government, either in the large sense of State, or in the
narrower sense. The words last added to the article relating to
Cooperation (which I think were inserted after Fawcett had left the
meeting) were intended expressly to meet the objection felt by him &
others that the Cooperative Associations might not be sufficiently
spontaneous.2 The State was never intended to have any part in the
matter except to grant land, on their application, to such spontaneous
cooperative associations as could give due guarantee of solidity, the
nature of which guarantees should be fixed by law.

There is surely something better for us to do than to drop all that part
of the programme which relates to the land & confine ourselves to
claiming for the public the accidental increase of rent. It would hardly
be worthwhile forming an association for a single point of land reform,
or for anything less than a comprehensive scheme. And the point in
question is precisely that which would meet with least support from the
higher and middle class reformers, while the working classes would not
be satisfied with it.

With regard to Snell’s Committee,3 you & Fawcett probably know more
about him, and what he is likely to do, than I have any means of
knowing.4 Edition: current; Page: [1717] But I should have thought that
if the leaders of the working classes are willing to join the Committee
we might do so. I do not know in what sense you mean that Snell may
“deliver us into the hands of Glyn.” If merely that you think he will
compound for too few seats, I see no harm. Such members of the Committee
as are willing to yield for a little, will have done all the work they
are capable of doing in getting that little, & probably never would be
able to get it if we who stand out for more did not unite with them. But
we should still be free to refuse to compound for so little, & the fact
that some of us had been bought off would be an encouragement, not a
discouragement to newcomers to join us and fill up our ranks again. Of
course what I say will not apply if you think we are likely to be quite
outvoted as the Committee in any corporate action; if the leaders of the
working men, content with their own Association5 for the same purpose,
have declined to join the Committee.

I am Dear Sir Charles Dilke

Mon cher d’Eichthal

Je suis ici pour quelques semaines, et je serai charmé d’y recevoir
l’annuaire de l’Association.2 Je vous envoie par mandat de poste ma
souscription annuelle.

Vous avez été heureux, c’est à dire clairvoyant, dans vos prévisions
politiques au commencement de la crise actuelle, et c’est là une forte
raison pour Edition: current; Page: [1718] ajouter foi à vos prédictions
d’aujourd’hui. Cependant j’ai grande envie de savoir sur quoi repose la
supposition que l’issue de la situation actuelle sera la république.3
Viendra-t-elle par un coup de main de la classe ouvrière de Paris et des
grandes villes? Alors tout dépend de la fidélité des soldats, qui sont
beaucoup plus nombreux et mieux armés et qui seront probablement mieux
commandés que dans les révolutions précédentes. Ou bien croyez-vous que
les électeurs apprendront à nommer des députés républicains? Cela me
semble fort douteux, en ce qui regarde les campagnes; car quoique les
paysans désirent, selon toute apparence, un gouvernement libéral,
l’élection des maires, etc., je crois que toutes les fois qu’on leur
fera croire qu’ils ont à choisir entre Napoléon et la république
socialiste, ils voteront pour Napoléon; et il faut avouer que les
républicains socialistes ne font rien pour les rassurer.

TO ALEXANDER BAIN1

Dear Bain—

I have now finished a careful reading of your book.2 When I compare it
with my own mode of treating the subject I am much struck with the
combination of nearly perfect agreement in the fond of our opinions on
every part of it with so much originality in the manner in which you
have presented many of them. This, if it stood alone, would make the
book very valuable for there is no more important service to any set of
thoughts than to vary their expression, & to deduce them from one
another in different ways. But in addition to this, by varying the modes
of statement you have illuminated points & aspects of our common
doctrine which the previous exposition had left more or less in the
shade. And you have followed out some of the principles into
consequences not previously drawn.

I find little or nothing, relating properly to Logic, from which I
dissent; but a good many apparent conflicts between your mode of
expressing & presenting technical details, & mine; in most of which
cases I still prefer my own. This applies chiefly to the first volume,3
& even that exclusive of its concluding Edition: current; Page: [1719]
chapters. When I next revise my Logic4 I shall carefully collate each
chapter with the corresponding chapter of yours: but in general, instead
of trying to incorporate your new matter, I think it will be both better
in itself, & fairer to you to refer to what you have done, give a brief
account of it, & direct the student to your fuller exposition. Of course
I cannot dispense with adapting the statement of the theory of Causation
to the Correlation of Force: but your book has confirmed me in the
opinion I had formed, that but little adaptation is required. In making
that little I shall be greatly helped by the clear light in which you
have placed the distinction between the two sorts of antecedent
conditions, the conditions of Force & those of Collocation.

Respecting the Conservation theory itself, you have given by many
degrees the clearest explanation of it that I have ever met with, & I
now seem to myself to understand the facts of the case pretty
completely. But about the mode of expression of the facts I still
boggle, & have a stronger impression after reading your exposition than
I had before that the men of science have not yet hit upon the correct
generalization though they may be at no great distance from it. I am so
anxious to understand this matter thoroughly that I write down my
difficulties in hopes that you will help me to resolve them.

In the first place, you exclude from the theory two of the principal
forces, Gravitation & Molecular Adhesion, expressly distinguishing these
from the “correlated forces.” Of course you do so because there is at
present no proof of the convertibility of the other forces into these; &
you do not take any notice of the hypothetical explanation of
gravitation by molecular motions, given by Tait5 (I believe) & others,
which so strikingly resemble the argument of Descartes to shew that his
vortices might generate a tendency to a centre. But though gravity does
not take its place in the theorem of conservation, motion generated by
gravity does. Suppose, then, a weight suspended by a string over the
shaft of a mine—suppose that the string breaks, & the weight falls, with
rapidly increasing velocity, to the bottom. Here is a positive addition
to the active force at work in the universe, which, when it ceases its
mechanical motion, remains in the form of heat or in some other of the
correlated forms. Now, at the expense of what pre-existing energy has
this force been generated? The conservationists are obliged to say, out
of potential energy. A given quantity of potential energy has become
actual; & if the weight is hoisted up again the power expended in
raising it is so much taken back from the sum of actual energy &
restored to the sum of potential.

Edition: current; Page: [1720]
Now I want to analyse the meaning of this phrase, “potential energy.” It
seems to signify some force actually residing in the suspended weight.
But it is nothing of the kind. There is a force actually residing in the
weight; a force exactly measurable: viz. the downward pressure with
which it pulls at the string, & by which it is able to neutralise an
equal weight at the other end of a lever. But this force is limited to
that with which the body would commence falling if the string broke, &
is far short of the vastly accelerated force with which it would reach
the bottom of the mine. When we are bid to say that this augmented force
existed previously as potential energy in the weight, this potential
energy is not to common sense & logic anything which really existed, but
is a mere name for our knowledge that a force would be created if the
body began to fall.

I am discussing the expressions, not denying any of the facts. I admit
that when force is expended in placing a weight in a “more advantageous
position,” as you express it (i.e. in a place from which it has further
to fall in order to reach its centre of attraction) when it does fall to
the depth from which it has been raised it will reproduce the exact
amount of force expended in raising it (making allowance for any part
which may have been transformed into heat). The expression “potential
energy” is no doubt adopted to enable us to say that the total amount of
force in all Nature can neither be increased nor diminished, the sum of
the actual force plus the sum of the potential being a constant
quantity. But this only means that there is a vast reserve of force not
existing in any shape now, but which gravity could call into existence,
& that this not actual but possible quantity of force has an extreme
limit, viz. the whole of the motion that would be generated by the
rushing together of all the gravitating bodies in the universe until
they could not possibly get any closer together. From time to time a
little of this possible force gets itself created & in that case it
requires that an equal force shd be expended if the effects produced are
to be counterbalanced or undone.

It seems to me a bad & misleading form of expression to ascribe the
motion which would be gradually acquired by gravitating bodies if the
obstacles which keep them apart were removed, to an energy of equivalent
amount residing in the body before it begins to move.

But if this objection could be overruled a greater remains behind. You
say (& this is a point quite new to me) that force may be, & is,
expended in merely altering the collocation of bodies, without
generating even potential energy. This I suppose is the case when force
is expended in destroying molecular adhesion. But if this be so, how can
the indestructibility of force be maintained? The sum of actual force
plus the sum of potential is, in that case diminished.

When you have time, perhaps you will kindly explain to me how the theory
of Conservation as at present expressed, can stand with this fact.

Edition: current; Page: [1721]
There are some questions in physical science which I shd like to ask of
you, but this can be done viva voce at some future time. In particular I
was not aware that chemical combination always produces heat. I will ask
you some time or other to tell me the explanation of the apparent
exceptions—freezing mixtures & the like.

Among the differences of mere language between your book & mine there is
only one which I much care about; your use of the word “elimination.” In
mathematics we eliminate what we want to get rid of: we eliminate y to
obtain an equation containing only x. Of late careless writers in
newspapers &c. having picked up the term have taken to using it in a
sense the reverse of this: they eliminate not what they turn out but
what they keep in: they eliminate the truth out of conflicting stories
&c. In your book you employ the term in both ways: whenever a separation
is effected between essentials & nonessentials, you speak
indiscriminately of “eliminating” either the one or the other.6 Is this
mode of using the term adopted from a deliberate choice? & what are the
advantages that recommend it to you?

TO ROWLAND G. HAZARD1

Avignon

May 18. 1870

Dear Sir

You have some reason to be surprised that so long a time has elapsed
since I received your Letters on Causation and Freedom in Willing2
without my having given you any intimation of the impression they have
made on my mind. The reason is, that ever since I received them, my
thoughts have been so much occupied with subjects not metaphysical, that
I really have not, until quite lately, been able to give the proper
attention to such a book as yours, or even to make myself acquainted
with more of its contents than was apparent on a cursory inspection. I
once began reading it through, but was obliged to leave off. At last,
however, I have had time to read it with the attention it deserves and
am able to tell you the result.

Your present book confirms and increases the impression I already had of
your acuteness, argumentative power, and perfect fairness both in
considering the subject and in discussing it. I do not think that your
side of the Edition: current; Page: [1722] question has ever been better
represented. The book, like your previous ones,3 does honour to American
thought. It seems to me, however, to mark that the discussion between us
has reached the point at which there is no advantage in our carrying it
any further; since the region of difference between us, instead of
narrowing, as is the case in controversies likely to have a successful
issue, is, on the contrary, very much enlarged. The exhaustive manner in
which you endeavour to meet everything which is said in opposition to
your conclusion, stirs up continual new ground, and raises a great
number of fresh differences of opinion. Were I to attempt to answer you,
I could hardly do so but by getting an interleaved copy, and writing
something on every blank leaf; for there are few pages of your book in
which there is not some proposition or argument which I contest. And
were you thereupon to follow my example, you would have to write another
book as large as this. Both of us would thus spend a great deal of time
for no sufficient result, since no important practical consequences
depend on our convincing one another. Our opinions agree as to the point
of real importance in practice, viz. that the moral government of human
beings, either by themselves or by their fellow creatures, must take
place by acting either upon their knowledge or their wants; i.e. either
upon their expectation of consequences from their acts, or upon their
feelings of desire and aversion towards those consequences.

I will merely touch briefly on one or two points on which something
seems necessary to be said in order to bring out the question between us
with greater definiteness and intelligibility.

1. You argue (with Professor Bowen)4 that our knowledge that we can
produce effects by volition must be antecedent to experience, because,
in order to have experience of this fact, we must already have willed.
The answer to this you will find in the exposition of the Volitional
part of human nature given in Professor Bain’s book “The Emotions and
the Will”,5 and more briefly in his and my own notes to the “Analysis of
the Human Mind.”6 The substance of it (which was anticipated by Hartley)
is, that all our voluntary motions were originally automatic; the
product of the mere physical activity of the system under the stimulus
of food and air, as when an infant free from restraint kicks about in
all directions. By these means, without any antecedent volition,
experience is acquired and an association formed between particular
movements and the wants which these movements are found to satisfy; and
the result is that the movements themselves come to be directed and
controlled by the ideas associated with them: from which elementary fact
all the complications of what we call the Will are gradually built
Edition: current; Page: [1723] up. I cannot here go any further into the
point, but this is the doctrine you have to combat.

2. I perceive that you attach great importance to maintaining the
simultaneity, in preference to the succession, of the immediate cause of
an effect and the effect itself. I confess that this question appears to
me equally unimportant and insoluble, inasmuch as the only point at
issue is, whether the commencement of the effect dates from the very
first instant at which the whole of the necessary previous conditions
come together, or from the very next instant after that instant. I do
not see how it can ever be ascertained which of these is the fact. And
whichever is so, Causation remains the law according to which the facts
of the universe succeed one another.

3. But you seem to use this supposed simultaneity as the formation of an
argument, when you say that the Past has no power of deciding human
voluntary determinations—that these conform solely to present facts,
viz: the agent’s expectations of the consequences that will follow his
actions and his wants. But no one pretends that they conform to anything
else. The mode in which past facts are supposed to determine our actions
is by determining these present facts, viz. our expectations (well or
ill grounded) of consequences, and our wants i.e. our desires and
aversions.

4. You take great pains to shew that the possibility of foreseeing how a
person will act, is consistent with his freedom. Many necessitarians, I
admit, have maintained the contrary; but I never did. I have never taken
any part in that controversy. My use of the possibility of prevision was
quite different. I used it to shew, that since we can foresee human
actions with as near an approach to correctness as we can foresee any of
the phenomena of dead matter which are equally complicated, and the
antecedents of which are equally obscure; it thence appears that there
is the same uniformity in the course of human actions as there is in the
remainder of the course of nature; or at least, that we have as much
ground for affirming such uniformity in the one case as in the other;
and the distinction contended for between voluntary acts and other
phenomena of nature, that the latter are in their own nature certain and
the former contingent, does not exist. This argument perhaps does not
apply to you, as you, apparently, do not assert that supposed
distinction, but consider the phenomena of inanimate nature as also the
direct effects of (divine) volition.

To turn to another subject: I am much obliged to you and to your son7
for the information you kindly sent respecting the operation of the
Ballot in the United States.8 From these and other communications I
infer that the popularity Edition: current; Page: [1724] of that method
of voting in America depends upon its convenience as a mode of
collecting large numbers of votes, and not upon its secrecy, which, as a
general rule, does not exist in America. It is now, to my great regret,
going to be tried in the United Kingdom; for, having been proposed by Mr
Gladstone’s Government, it is sure to be carried before long.9 Voting by
putting tickets into a box is a very good method, provided that each
voter signs his ticket with his name. But in England the object in view
is to conceal the name; and though the voters can scarcely, by any
change, be made to feel less moral responsibility for their votes than a
great proportion of them do now, I believe that the secrecy of the vote
will tend very much to prevent the growth of a feeling of moral
responsibility in time to come, while it will shield from all discredit
the man who votes contrary to his known or professed opinions. I am

I do not think there is much that I could do with the leaders of the
working classes by means of your Resolutions.2 The Resolutions go into
details on which they might conflict with the line already taken up by
the working classes at their public meetings, especially in the
limitation applied to the compulsory principle, and possibly in the
constitution you propose for the school committees. The point which it
is really of importance to impress on the working classes is the
necessity of a skilled central initiative instead of leaving the
initiation of measures to local boards: and on this I do not think the
working classes likely to be unwilling listeners. It does not seem to me
that they have anti-centralisation prejudices: it is the lower middle
class, who are accustomed to get local management into their hands, that
are unwilling to share power with a central authority. I think you
should put yourself directly in communication with the leaders of the
working men. It is your working Edition: current; Page: [1725] so much
through others that prevents you from having the personal weight and
importance you ought to have. People really do not know how many of the
most important practical ideas afloat originated with you. The only
leaders of the working classes whom I know personally (except very
slightly) are Odger, Cremer, and Howell. The last two I know best, and I

Mon cher d’Eichthal—

Le discours de M. Basiadis2 est vraiment très remarquable dans le
rapport de la langue. C’est l’ancien grec dans la pureté de ses formes
grammaticales, et ce qu’on y remarque de modification dans le
vocabulaire et dans la tournure d’expression n’est que celle qu’éprouve
toute langue vivante dans le cours des siècles. On voit cette
modification avec plaisir, car l’affectation d’écrire en tout comme
écrivaient les anciens entrainerait à ne se permettre d’autres pensées
que les leurs. Pour moi je suis d’avis que le Latin de Bacon et de
Descartes est à beaucoup d’égards un grand progrès sur celui de Cicéron.
Des penseurs comme eux, s’ils eussent existé du temps des Césars
auraient certainement aggrandi et enrichi le Latin classique; et quand
il se trouvera en Grèce un homme du génie de Platon ou d’Aristotle il
fera faire à la langue Grecque des progrès pareils à ceux que ces
philosophes lui feront faire.

Edition: current; Page: [1726]
Ceci entre parfaitement dans les idées de vos “Observations”3 où j’ai
reconnu une grande justesse de pensée, jointe à des détails historiques
très intéressants. Je vous trouve parfaitement dans le vrai quant au
genre de réforme à faire dans la langue vulgaire. J’ai remarqué par
parenthèse deux errata, à la page 118, ligne 12 l’imprimeur a mis
“matérielle” au lieu d’ “intellectuelle,” et à la page 140 ligne 2 on
lit “le siècle de Péricles” là où vous avez dû écrire “le siècle de
Philippe.”

Je vous remercie bien des explications que vous m’avez données sur votre
prédiction politique.4 Maintenant que je la comprends mieux, j’en
reconnais aisément la justesse. J’avais d’abord crû que vous vous
attendiez à un dénouement républicain beaucoup plus prompt. Je crois
avec vous que le progrès de l’opinion est dans le sens des convictions
républicaines, et cela dans une forme plus élevée et plus profonde que
tout ce qu’on entendait par ce mot du temps de notre jeunesse. Vous avez
assisté au berceau de ces nouveaux éléments par votre participation au
mouvement Saint Simonien et ma lettre de 18315 montre que dès lors j’ai
pleinement reconnu l’importance européenne de ce mouvement. Mais
l’opinion ne peut être assez forte pour prévaloir sur les obstacles que
lorsqu’elle sera devenue assez générale pour gagner l’armée. Tant qu’il
y aura 7 millions d’ignorants pour voter des plébiscites de confiance et
1 million d’hommes armés prêts à obéir aux ordres de leur chefs, il me
semble que nous sommes encore très éloignés du but que sans doute on
finira par atteindre.

Je ne connais pas personnellement M. Mundella6 mais je vous envoie une
lettre adressée à M. Hughes,7 membre de la Chambre des Communes, qui a
pris une part très active dans le mouvement coopératif depuis son
commencement, ainsi que dans la question des Trade Unions et qui pourra
faire connaître à M. votre fils non seulement M. Mundella mais la
plupart de ceux qui ont joué un rôle utile dans ces questions, y compris
les chefs les plus intelligents des associations ouvrières. M. Hughes a
été membre de la Commission nommée pour étudier la question des Trade
Unions et il y a voté avec la minorité dont le support à mon avis était
le seul bon.

TO SIR CHARLES WENTWORTH DILKE1

May 28. 1870

Dear Sir Charles

It seems to me that the position of the Women’s Suffrage question is
immensely improved by what has taken place in Parliament.2 You yourself
a few weeks ago could not count as many as 100 members of parliament who
Edition: current; Page: [1728] were known to be in our favour, & there
are now, including pairs and absentees, 184, considerably above a fourth
part of the House; of whom 29 voted in the second who had not voted in
the first division. The amount even of Tory support was most promising,
including some of the most prominent members of the party below Cabinet
rank, and among others both the whips. We knew that we had not a
majority in the House, and that when the thing looked serious, our
enemies were sure to rally and outvote us unless the Government took up
the cause, which the time had certainly not come for expecting. The
rally is the first proof we have had that the thing is felt to be
serious. I am in great spirits about our prospects, and think we are
almost within as many years of victory as I formerly thought decades.3

But I think it would be a great mistake to merge the women’s question in
that of universal suffrage. Women’s suffrage has quite enemies enough,
without adding to the number all the enemies of universal suffrage. To
combine the two questions would practically suspend the fight for
women’s equality, since universal suffrage is sure to be discussed
almost solely as a working men’s question: and when at last victory
comes, there is sure to be a compromise, by which the working men would
be enfranchised without the women, and the contest for women’s rights
would have to be begun again from the beginning, with the working men
inside the barrier instead of outside, and therefore with their selfish
interests against our cause instead of with it. Thus women’s
enfranchisement would be thrown back for a whole generation, for
universal suffrage is not likely to be obtained in less time than that;
and at the end of the generation we should start again in a more
disadvantageous position than we are in at present.

Want of time, and other causes, make it impossible for me to undertake
the essay requested for the new Cobden Club volume.4

I hear from Mr Pratt of Bombay,5 that you have been looking into his
case. I know nothing of it or of him but what I have heard from himself,
but there is great appearance of his being an injured man; for, the
government having acknowledged him to be substantially in the right, by
abolishing the abuse he pointed out, the only ground on which they can
have furnished him Edition: current; Page: [1729] with any pretence of
reason is that there was something in the manner of doing what he did,
which was inconsistent with official subordination, and on that, if, as
he affirms, the late Governor Sir Bartle Frere6 thinks him perfectly in
the right, I would back Frere’s opinion at any odds against that of the
Tory underling, Fitzgerald.7 He seems also to have a prima facie case of
at least favoritism against Fitzgerald with reference to the Bombay firm
whom he attacked. Do you not think that it is altogether a case which
requires that a question or questions should be asked in Parliament? any
further steps to be dependent on the kind of answer received? I am

thorough advocacy of your system, of which it will spread the knowledge
and appreciation through France and Europe in a very effective manner.
There is only one point on which he stops short of you. Thinking it vain
to hope that electors will fill up intelligently, or fill up at all, a
list equal to the entire number of the House, he would divide the
country into large districts, and hold a separate election for each, the
voter only putting down as many names as the district returns members.
But he has a supplementary proposal which would give to this plan a
great part of the advantages of yours. Whenever a district cannot make
up the quota for its full number of deputies, then, instead of supplying
the remainder by a simple majority of votes, all the voting Edition:
current; Page: [1730] papers which have not served for a return are to
be sent to a central office, to have the quota made up whenever possible
from the similar voting papers of the whole country. Now these voting
papers would be chiefly those of the electors who had voted for national
in preference to local names; so that persons of known merit, but
without local influence, would have facilities for being elected,
approaching to those which your system would give them.

I should much like to know what you think of this plan, both in itself
and as an intermediate step.

A time seems to be coming in France, when improvements tending to
correct the defects in the machinery of universal suffrage, without
impairing, but on the contrary giving for the first time real effect to
its principle, will have more chance than heretofore of a favourable
hearing from the friends of universal suffrage; in order to take away
weapons from the Orleanist and bourgeois party, who are thought to be
making plans for indirectly reducing universal suffrage to a nullity.

What immense progress the cause of Women’s Suffrage has made since
1867:4 the number of votes rendered for it at one or other of the
divisions 162, double the number of three years ago; making up with the
known adherents who were absent, more than a fourth of the house: and
including both Liberal and Tory names which were little expected. And
the bill was only thrown out by a rally of its enemies in force, shewing
that, for the first time, they felt it to be a serious matter; which it
must be our business that they shall never hereafter cease to feel it.
We may count among our gains, the tone of exasperation which has
succeeded to that of mockery in the Saturday Review, Pall Mall Gazette,
&c. which is at once a sign that they feel us to be getting on, and a
help, by the resentment which their insolence rouses in women. As soon
as a sufficient number of women can be sufficiently roused, success is
certain. I am

I think it ought to be the aim of our endeavours, to accelerate the
period when male voters will vote against a member for refusing the
franchise to Edition: current; Page: [1731] women. In proportion as we
succeed in inducing women to desire the suffrage, we shall gain the
electoral votes of an increasing number of their husbands & fathers; and
a small fraction of the constituency making any particular point a
condition of their support, often compels the candidate to subscribe to
it. Between now and the next general election a great deal may be
achieved in this way. But there is still more to be hoped from the
progress of conviction in the minds of members of parliament. It is not
the pressure of constituencies which has doubled the number of our
parliamentary supporters since 1867. Is there not something marvellous
in so great a progress? It is an important fact to know that Noel2 &
Col. Taylor3 voted for the Bill avowedly on party grounds. With the
opinion of the whips and (we may be sure) of the leader of the party,
that it is a good party move, we may count positively upon very soon
gaining quite as many votes by “party hope” on that side as we lose by
party fear on the other. And it is very encouraging to hear that in
addition to the liberals who have voted or paired for us in spite of
party fear, there are many more who would do the same if that disturbing
consideration were absent. It shews what strong ground there is for hope
from our continuing to act, with all the force we can command, upon the
general mind of the country. Moreover, we have often found that the very
Liberals who express the strongest fears for the Liberal party if women
had votes, and ground their refusal to join in our agitation upon this
fear, seem suddenly to lose it altogether when from some cause or other
they begin really to wish that women had votes. In fact, this fear for
the Liberal party is accordingly apt to be the last subterfuge in which
men entrench themselves who have too much liberal principle and too much
perception of logic to be able to take up any other, but who at the
bottom of their hearts do not like the equality between men and women.
Every year diminishes the dread and dislike of this equality among just
such men; and in the same proportion diminishes their fears for the
interest of the Liberal party. I am

I do not conceive that those who think as we do can support any proposal
which would tax Catholics, Jews, and Secularists for religious teaching
which (though it might be undenominational as regards the different
divisions of Protestant Christians) would be such as they would not
consent to have given to their own children. I see no mode in which the
plan of the Dissenters, taken up by Vernon Harcourt,2 could be supported
by us, unless provision were made that Catholics, Jews and Secularists
on declaring themselves such, should be excused a part of the school
rate. If this is not done, probably the best course for those who think
as we do would be not to vote at all on Vernon Harcourt’s Resolution. It
would not do to vote against it, because that would be giving the
preference to the Government plan, which is worse.

When the time comes for succeeding in a proposal to leave religious
teaching altogether to the voluntary principle, I think the different
religious denominations should be left to organize the teaching as they
please. It is not likely they would leave the expense to be defrayed
exclusively by the parents of the children. It would be a point both of
honour and of interest with Edition: current; Page: [1733] every
denomination, to raise a fund for the payment of religious instructors
for as many of the children as would accept such instruction at their
hands. The churches and sects, being relieved from voluntary
subscriptions for secular instruction will have the whole amount
available for religious, for the sake of which chiefly it is that many
of their number subscribe for education at all. I am

I have received your three letters but (owing to my absence from
England) not your pamphlet,2 & I shall not now see it until my return,
which will be in the beginning of next month. From what I already know
of the case,3 I am convinced that justice requires the Government to
take upon itself the responsibility of culpable not to say criminal
mismanagement which could not have taken place except through the
connivance or guilty negligence of the Government directors & which by
placing those directors on the Board the government pledges its
integrity to prevent. I am therefore most desirous to give you all the
help I can. When I have read your statement I shall be better able than
I am to judge in what manner this can best be done.

I think it will be quite right that you should send copies of the
pamphlet to Mr Gladstone & the D. of Argyll accompanied by a short
letter & the draft you sent me is very good, but I think you might
advantageously throw down into the letter something of what of course
predominates in the pamphlet, a direct appeal to their sense of justice.

Dear Sir—

I have read your little tract with interest but I perceive that you have
either published or intend to publish another pamphlet containing the
remedies you propose for the evils you so justly denounce. In the
meantime I will only say that I think you underrate the power of Trade
Unions to raise wages; & that I differ from you when you say that a
general rise of wages would be of no use to the working classes because
it would produce a general rise of prices. A general rise of prices, of
anything like a permanent character, can only take place through a
general increase of the money incomes of the purchasing community. Now a
general rise of wages would not increase the aggregate money incomes,
nor consequently the aggregate purchasing power of the community; it
would only transfer part of that purchasing power from Edition: current;
Page: [1735] the employers to the labourers. Consequently a general rise
of wages would not raise prices but would be taken out of the profits of
the employers; always supposing that those profits were sufficient to
bear the reduction.

The case is different with a rise of wages confined to a single, or a
small number of employments. That rise if taken out of profits, would
place a particular class of employers at a disadvantage compared with
other employers: & as soon as they ceased to hope that the loss would be
only temporary, they would withdraw part of their capital, or at all
events, all new capital would avoid those trades & go into others.
Consequently the supply of these particular articles would fall short, &
their prices would rise so as to indemnify the employers for the rise of
wages. But this would not happen in case of a rise of all wages, for as
all capitalists would be affected nearly alike they could not as a body
relieve themselves by turning their capital into another employment.

Monsieur—

Le mot respect n’a pas en Anglais la signification que d’après votre
lettre il paraît avoir en français. C’est un mot qui exprime
particulièrement la considération pour les qualités morales, et qui
s’emploie entre égaux autant qu’entre supérieur et inférieur. Par une
des bizarreries que l’accident engendre souvent dans les langues, cette
différence d’usage est l’inverse de celle qui a lieu à l’égard du mot
“respectable”, mot qui a en français un sens moral, tandis qu’en anglais
vulgaire il n’exprime guère qu’une certaine position sociale. Vous
m’avez rendu un service en m’avertissant de la nuance en question qui,
si je l’avais connue plutôt m’eût souvent permis d’éviter un manque
d’usage.

Quant à la question du travail des enfants, l’opinion générale comme
celle des hommes éclairés en Angleterre se prononce de plus en plus pour
la limitation légale, accompagnée du système half-time.2 On étend cette
législation de plus en plus, en sorte qu’elle s’applique maintenant à
presque toutes les industries qui ne sont pas purement domestiques, sauf
l’agriculture qui jusqu’ici fait exception. L’expérience a prouvé que la
loi peut seule faire face à l’intérêt combiné des fabricants et des
pères des enfants à exploiter le travail de ces infortunés aux dépens de
leur éducation et même de leur développement Edition: current; Page:
[1736] physique, et cette expérience a graduellement prévalu sur les
idées de liberté individuelle. En effet, la liberté individuelle n’est
sacrée que dans ce qui ne regarde, au moins directement, que l’individu,
et ne peut être invoqué pour l’exercice illimité d’un pouvoir quelconque
sur les autres, dont les abus sont toujours dans le domaine légitime des
lois. Cependant je suis tout à fait d’accord avec vous en ce qui regarde
le travail des femmes, qu’en angleterre on a soumis à quelques-unes des
mêmes restrictions légales que celui des enfants. Vous savez combien je
condamne les iniquités de la position actuelle des femmes dans la
famille et dans la société, mais cette habitude de les traiter comme des
enfants me semble contraire à leur dignité et à leur véritable intérêt.
Je voudrais qu’en les protégeant beaucoup mieux qu’à présent contre les
abus de la force physique, on les reconnût comme moralement capables de
se conduire et de s’engager par elles-mêmes, et qu’on ne fît aucune
différence quant à la liberté des contrats, entre elles et les hommes.

S’il vous serait agréable de posséder les dernières enquêtes
parlementaires sur le travail des enfants j’aurai grand plaisir à les
procurer et à vous les envoyer après mon retour en angleterre qui aura
lieu dans le commencement de juillet. Je vous serais de mon côté très
reconnaissant de tout renseignement sur le succès du système half time
en Belgique, système qui en angleterre rencontre encore quelque
opposition.

Je regrette que vous soyez du nombre considérable des hommes distingués
dans les lettres ou dans les sciences qui dans notre siècle comme en
d’autres ont été privés de la vue.3 Cette privation vous est commune
avec mon ami M. Fawcett qui de tous nos hommes publics d’aujourd’hui,
s’est le plus occupé de cette question du travail des enfants. Comme
vous il se soutient noblement contre ce découragement; il ne se relâche
en rien dans les travaux qu’il s’était proposés comme l’occupation de sa
vie et dans lesquels il promet à sa patrie une carrière aussi utile que
distinguée.

June 26, 1870

My dear Cowper—

I knew before reading your pamphlet2 that the Bombay Government, having
by the Constitution of the Bank the appointment [of] Edition: current;
Page: [1737] three of the nine directors, was morally responsible, not
necessarily for the strict prudence of all the Bank’s transactions, but
at all events for their not being in violation of the admitted &
generally practised rules of safe & legitimate banking. I knew also that
those rules had, by the directors of the Bank, been flagrantly &
systematically violated. But even after all I had read, my idea of their
misconduct fell short of what it is shown to have been by your detailed
history of their proceedings, & the many years during which I knew,
studied, & profited by the work you did for the Bombay Govt. have taught
me to repose great confidence in any statements of yours, which moreover
in the present case rest upon, & can be easily collated with, the report
of a Government Commission.3

It is hardly possible for abuse of trust to be carried to a greater
pitch in the forms of banking than it was by the managers of the Bombay
Bank, when, to omit many other disgraceful facts, nearly half the
capital of the Bank passed, on nominal security, into the hands of a
speculator4 who was himself one of the directors, or into those of
friends recommended by him, generally for the purpose of puffing up his
own special actions; when the Secretary, Mr. Blair,5 who was allowed to
lavish the funds of the Bank without check or control, received large
pecuniary favours from this person; and when two even of the Govt.
directors, one of whom was long President of the Bank,6 realised large
sums by the sale of allotments which they received from speculative
companies to whom loans were made by the Bank: the case was certainly
one which, in a good system of commercial law, would come within the
definition of criminal bankruptcy, and if justice were done, the chief
culprits would be expiating their guilt by fine & imprisonment. Now I
find that the Government, through the whole course of the Bank’s
misconduct, were as utterly regardless of their obligation to watch &
control its management as if no such obligation had existed. They gave
no instructions to the Govt Directors. They allowed the Bank to be
carried on under the new charter without even any by-laws to govern &
direct its management. And they neither obtained nor sought from their
representatives on the Board any information respecting its proceedings.
The great pressure of public business on an Indian Govt might be some,
though a very insufficient excuse for this quiescence as long as there
was nothing to excite suspicion. But the quiescence continued after the
mismanagement & embarrassments of the Bank were so notorious even in
England as to alarm the Secretary of State, who felt it his duty to warn
the Bombay Govt. After this the conduct of the Govt. was if anything
more discreditable than before. Their unwillingness to admit that
anything was seriously Edition: current; Page: [1738] amiss almost
amounted to complicity. To the warnings & questionings which they now
frequently received from their superiors in England & at Calcutta, they
answered smooth things, extenuating to the utmost the amount of
mischief, abetting the directors in witholding information demanded of
them, & acting as if it were their deliberate purpose to screen the
misconduct of the Bank, though probably only desirous of screening their
own neglect of the duty of supervision. It is shown that had the Bombay
Govt., even after they had become aware of the evil, done their duty in
preventing further malversation, the Bank notwithstanding the great
losses already sustained might have been saved from insolvency, & the
property of the shareholders might have been in great part preserved to
them. By not having done this, even if by nothing else, the Bombay Govt.
made itself morally a party to the misconduct of the Directors &
responsible for it to the sufferers.

It may be said that the majority of the Directors, including those most
certainly guilty, were elected by the shareholders. But considering the
extreme difficulty under which the shareholders labour, as well in
England as in India, in choosing trustworthy directors or in controlling
them, it is certain that the shareholders placed (as they had every
reason to think themselves warranted in placing) their principal
reliance on the Govt; whose representatives on the Board, themselves
high in the public service, must if they did their duty to Govt even as
the largest shareholder in the Bank, take care that its interests in
common with those of the other shareholders, shd receive ordinary &
decent regard from those to whose charge they were entrusted. The
shareholders would have had no claim to indemnity from the Govt for
ordinary losses, or for such as were occasioned by irresistible
circumstances, or even by ordinary & venial mismanagement. But they have
a just claim in foro conscientiae to reparation from the Govt for loss
sustained by gross and criminal violation of duty on the part of its
agents. An able speaker in the H. of C. who was master of the facts
could make a speech on them which would resound through the whole
country & which would be damaging to any Govt that resisted the claim.

You are at liberty to make use of this opinion of mine in any quarter in
which you think it would be of service. If it goes to Mr Gladstone or
the D. of Argyll, I would rather it shd be as an enclosure in your
letter than directly from myself. But though I think well of the
intentions of both those ministers, I think them sufficiently like
ministers in general to be much more certainly influenced through the
press than by any representation addressed to themselves. I could put
your pamphlet into the hands of the editors of several newspapers &
could probably induce them to pay some attention to the subject. How far
they might be willing to proceed in what might be opposition to the Govt
I cannot tell.

Edition: current; Page: [1739]
There are several courses to choose from, & it is for you to consider
which of them you prefer. One is to defer any appeal to Parlt or the
public until it is certain that your application to the authorities is
unsuccessful. Another is to endeavour to get a motion made in the H. of
C. And if this be determined on, the question occurs whether it shd be
done in the present session, or early in the next, the public mind being
in the meantime acted on as much as possible through the press. If you
decide for this session, I will when I return to E. which will be in
about a fortnight, consult with my parliamentary friends & try to find
some one in the House willing to take up the subject & capable of doing
it with effect. There shd if possible be simultaneously an organisation
through the press & any influence I have with editors I will most gladly
make use of but as I have said I do not know how far it is likely to be
effectual.

Dear Sir

I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of June 17. I agree in
the main, with all that you say respecting the limitation of the right
of property even in moveable wealth.2 I never meant to say that this
right should be altogether unlimited, nor to ascribe to it sacredness in
any other sense than that all the necessary conditions of human
happiness are sacred. I do not, indeed, quite agree with your friend Mr
Wright,3 when, in the passage quoted and concurred in by you, he seems
to say that, from the utilitarian point of view, the right of private
ownership is founded solely on the motives it affords to the increase of
public wealth; because independently of those motives, the Edition:
current; Page: [1740] feeling of security of possession and enjoyment,
which could not (in the state of advancement mankind have yet reached)
be had without private ownership, is of the very greatest importance as
an element of human happiness. But this is probably a difference rather
in expression than in opinion between us.

There is, however, this great practical difference between the case of
moveable wealth and that of land, that, so long as land is allowed to be
private property (and I cannot regard its private appropriation as a
permanent institution) society seems to me bound to provide that the
proprietor shall only make such uses of it as shall not essentially
interfere with its utility to the public: while, in the case of capital,
and moveable property generally, though society has the same right, yet
the interests of society would in general be better consulted by laws
restrictive of the acquisition of too great masses of property, than by
attempting to regulate its use. I have, in my Political Economy,
proposed limitations of the right of ownership, so far as the power of
bequest is part of it, on the express ground of its being injurious to
society that enormous fortunes should be possessed by gift or
inheritance.4

My daughter and I are greatly obliged to you and Mrs Norton for your
kind invitation.5 It would be a real pleasure to us both to avail
ourselves of it. But we have been calculating lately whether we can
afford to allow ourselves, this summer and autumn, a holiday of ten days
or only of four, and such are the calls on our time and the quantity of
work we have to do that we have been compelled to decide for the shorter
of the two.

July 9. 1870

My dear Sir

I am greatly obliged to you for your letter, with the greater part of
which I fully sympathize. Most especially do I concur in what you say
about confining the movement as far as possible to women domestic in
their tastes and habits, who have fulfilled their own duties in an
exemplary manner; and also to women of good education and breeding, not
lovers of fuss or notoriety. Unhappily the success we have attained
attracts, like all other success, the sort of people who are always
seeking to turn a penny or push themselves into notoriety. The very
success which has brought home the knowledge that there are such
opinions as ours to a sufficient number of households to influence the
country, brings with it unhappily in its train the crowd of vulgar
selfseekers. But however quiet the means we take for bringing opinion
round to us, we cannot escape this hateful train of pushing and vulgar,
except by escaping success. The very day and hour that it begins to be
felt there are many who agree with us, the selfseekers will thrust
themselves in, whether it be sooner or whether it be later. They are the
signs of prosperity, and its curses, which we cannot escape. The
question therefore, appears to me to Edition: current; Page: [1743]
be—Cannot we associate the cause with quiet, upright, and ladylike
women, as well as with vulgar, questionable, and pushing ones? I am
aware that nothing but a strong sense of duty will induce such women to
expose themselves to be, even by mistake, associated with the others.
But should we do well to leave the others as the sole public
representatives of our cause? which will be the consequence if all the
quiet and self-respecting women remain hidden in their own homes. This
was a cause of great anxiety with us last winter. We knew that Mrs
Taylor would have lady speakers, if possible, at the London meeting,2
and we knew that if we could not find ladies who would do what we
thought credit to the cause Mrs Taylor would be thrown back upon those
friends of the cause, of whom there are plenty, who have more energy
than discretion. Now it has been our constant effort to keep the London
Committee free from association with pushing people; and we feel that
your influence will be of great use in helping this, weighing heavily on
the side of discretion and reserve. Unfortunately, too many of those
whose influence will be of use on this side, instead of joining in the
work, and throwing their influence on the right side, are apt
pusillanimously to withhold themselves altogether. Yet this is, in a
manner, a monastic view of public affairs. If all the highminded shrink
into the congenial privacy of their own homes (as in the middle ages
into a convent) they leave none but the vulgar minded to occupy the
public eye, and produce an effect upon the world at large. We must
remember that there are vast numbers in the country, to whom the papers
and public agitation are the only openings for obtaining knowledge of
what other people are thinking. People of small means, who have little
or no social intercourse, and who cannot afford to buy or borrow many
books, yet see a penny paper, and hear of public meetings in their own
neighbourhood. It would take many generations to touch these, solely
through private intercourse. Yet this class of people are worthy and
excellent, deserve as much attention as the higher classes, and by their
numbers are fully as influential on the course of politics. Indeed, for
a long time past, it has been they who have forced new ideas upon the
upper classes, not the upper classes upon them. And yet, to work upon
them, it is necessary to condescend to the vulgar instruments of the
press and public agitation. Mrs Taylor, in all her action, mainly
regards these: and we cannot say that we think her altogether wrong: but
we should like to see a course of conduct struck out which might be
suitable to all classes of society, and we think that with sufficient
care and thought it might be done. If we regarded only the upper
classes, it would be well to work only by social means: if we regarded
only the lower and lower middle, almost any means of publicity would be
useful. Is it quite impossible to strike a reasonable balance between
the two? This is a question which we should like much to discuss with
you.

Edition: current; Page: [1744]
I cannot agree in considering the result of the division in the House of
Commons this session as a check.3 Of course it was called so by
opponents; if only to conceal the enormous progress it really shewed us
to have made. I cannot conceive that the measure ever could have passed
this year (or that it can pass for many years to come): but I had not
imagined that 150 members of the House of Commons were prepared to vote
for it, as they did. This year’s division has shewn that the measure has
nearly doubled its supporters in the House of Commons in the last three
years. I am not sanguine enough to hope that we can receive many more
such “checks”; if we could, within nine years, by a very simple process
of arithmetic, we should have the measure passed by unanimity through
the House of Commons, and then we might defy the Lords! Surely, on due
reflection, this cannot be fairly called a check.

As regards the other movement4 which has lately sprung up, to which you
allude, there is no doubt that it has greatly intensified the bitterness
of one or two writers in the press (who might be easily named) who
however, at the best, were always vehement opponents of any emancipation
of women. Those gentlemen are now really angry, because in this
particular movement they see women’s point of view producing practical
results upon the elections.5 Hence they are really frightened; but we
should have had them just as bitter against the suffrage whenever that
also was a sufficiently popular cry to influence the elections: and of
course you and I hope it may be that, some day. I do not think that the
majority of women who have interested themselves in this unpleasant
matter are influenced by any of the base motive you seem to attribute to
some of them. I believe that there has seldom been a movement of purer
chivalry than this among respectable women who are exposing themselves
to almost intolerable insult, wholly from the goadings of their
conscience, and their belief that they are responsible if they do
nothing for the horrible degradation of fellow-women. So far as I have
seen, it has been this feeling, that the connivance of virtuous women
alone makes it possible for so-called decent men to call into existence
the “profession” which is in question—it is this feeling which has made
the strength of this particular movement among women. Of course, there
may be exceptions; but it so happens that all women whom I know of,
concerned in the matter, are middle aged, and most of them mothers of
families: and this movement also has convinced large numbers of people
(including Mr Maurice, and Miss Carpenter) that women ought to have the
suffrage.

I should be very glad to have an occasion for talking over these matters
with you, and my daughter wrote in April last to Mrs Kingsley, asking
her Edition: current; Page: [1745] whether there was any chance of our
seeing you and her at Blackheath this year, either in the month of July
or August. My daughter’s letter was addressed to Eversley, and we
suppose Mrs Kingsley has not received it.6

single pronoun. You say “According to Comte (as will be seen by
reference to the passage just quoted) the reason for this is” &c. It is
not clear what is the antecedent to “this”. I presume “the reason for

ensemble. But it reads as if it meant the reason why every organism is
an ensemble.

Dear Madam:

It gives me the greatest pleasure to know that the service rendered by
my dear wife to the cause which was nearer her heart than any Edition:
current; Page: [1748] other, by her essay in the Westminster Review,2
has had so much effect, and is so justly appreciated in the United
States. Were it possible in a memoir to have the formation and growth of
a mind like hers portrayed, to do so would be as valuable a benefit to
mankind as was ever conferred by a biography.

But such a psychological history is seldom possible, and in her case the
materials for it do not exist. All that could be furnished is her
birth-place, parentage, and a few dates! and it seems to me that her
memory is more honored by the absence of any attempt at a biographical
notice, than by the presence of a most meagre one.

What she was I have attempted, though most inadequately, to delineate in
the remarks prefaced to her Essay, as reprinted with my “Dissertations
and Discussions.”

I am very glad to hear of the step in advance made by the Rhode Island
Legislature in constituting a board of women for some very important
administrative purposes. Your intended proposal that women should be
impaneled on every jury where women are to be tried seems to me very
good, and calculated to place the injustice to which women are subjected
at present, by the entire legal system, in a very striking light.

I am, dear madam, yours very sincerely,

B[lackheath] P[ark]

July 22, 1870

My dear Mr Kinnear—

Though I regret very much that you do not sufficiently agree with the
articles of the new Programme,2 to feel justified in remaining a member
of the Association, it is not without deliberate consideration that I
have concurred in a course of policy for the Assn which we knew would
prevent many persons whose support would have been valuable from joining
it. We had to choose, however, between losing their adhesion, &
depriving ourselves of all support whatever from the working classes: &
we might still hope that those who had accepted our first programme
would cooperate with us from without on the important points on which
they agree with us, while as an Association we shd have no power of
usefulness whatever unless we could enlist in our support the most
intelligent part of the working classes; who are very generally adopting
as their creed the entire resumption of the land from private hands into
those of the State.3 We thought it the wisest course, therefore, instead
of limiting our demands so as to obtain the greatest attainable amount
of adhesion among the higher & middle classes to go as far to meet the
demands of the working classes as we conscientiously could, provided
that by this means we could induce them to support us & act with us; and
the Conference with some of their leaders at which you were present,
showed that they were willing to do so.

The provision for the purchase by the State of land in the market, would
be chiefly applicable to neighbourhoods in which there are neither
common lands, nor lands belonging to public bodies, sufficient to give a
fair trial to small holdings & to cooperative agriculture. I quite agree
with you that public bodies ought not to hold lands; but I think it
quite worth trial how the State could manage landed property (which is a
great part of its business in India). And of one thing I feel certain
that nothing but a trial on a large scale, & for a considerable period,
would convince the working classes that such a system would be
unsuccessful or injurious.

The article asserting the right of the State to the “unearned increase”4
&c Edition: current; Page: [1750] is not so worded as to imply that
landowners are to be dealt hardly with in this respect. Its purpose is
simply to assert the legitimacy of special taxation on land, in
consideration of the special property it possesses, in a prosperous
country, of continually rising in value. No doubt, as you say, this rise
could not have been so great as it has been & is, had there been no
improvements in agriculture, because, without those improvements, the
growth of wealth & population could not have reached anything like the
same extent. The improvements however arise in great part, from the
improved skill, & knowledge, & exertion of the tenants, not the
landlords. And, for what the landlords have done, they would be
indemnified by the option allowed them (& now inserted in the programme)
of resigning their land to the State at the market price. It is
probable, as you say, that the price of wheat is not now higher,
proportionally to other things, than it was many years ago. But I
apprehend that this is owing to foreign importation; & that nearly all
other agricultural produce, especially cattle, meat, & dairy produce,
have risen in an extraordinary degree.

Other property than land may, no doubt, rise in value without any
exertion on the part of the owners. But I do not know of any other kind
of property of any importance, which rises in value from generation to
generation in every improving county by a sort of natural law, the
exceptions to which are rare & only temporary. Not to mention that land
being the gift of nature, & of limited quantity, a system of landed
property which was just & reasonable so long as land was obtainable by
all, is fairly liable to reconsideration as soon as the land has become
insufficient in quantity, & has been engrossed by a small number of
proprietors.

I hope your visit to the Channel islands will accelerate the restoration
of your health which I was very sorry to hear stood so much in need of
recruiting.

Dear Sir—

I have received and read the essays2 which you did me the honour to
send. I am quite of your opinion as to the usefulness, in the present
stage of human improvement, of speaking out, without reserve, whatever
Edition: current; Page: [1751] opinions one has deliberately formed on
topics important to mankind, subject, of course, to the duty of
satisfying oneself by calm consideration that one knows, and has taken
into account, such qualifications and counter considerations as may be
necessary to make one’s opinion a fair expression of the truth. I do
not, however, blame a person who stops short of the complete public
expression of unpopular opinions, when it would involve serious danger
of the loss of his means of subsistence; for though it is often a merit,
it is only in peculiar cases a duty, in any one to be a martyr for his
opinions.

You are mistaken in thinking that I have purposely withheld, in my book
on “The Subjection of Women”, any opinions which I thought relevant to
the subject.3 The purpose of that book was to maintain the claim of
women, whether in marriage or out of it, to perfect equality in all
rights with the male sex. The relaxation or alteration of the marriage
laws, in any other respect than by taking away all vestiges of the
subordination of one sex to the other, is a question quite distinct from
the object to which the book is devoted, and one which, in my own
opinion, cannot be properly decided until that object has been attained.
It is impossible, in my opinion, that a right marriage law can be made
by men alone, or until women have an equal voice in making it. You say
in one of your essays that my book recommends that marriage should be
dissoluble at the will of either of the parties. Now I carefully avoided
giving any opinion as to the conditions under which marriage should be
dissoluble, for the very good reason that I have not formed, and do not
consider either myself or any one else capable at present of forming, a
well-grounded opinion on the subject. I, of course, accept your
proposition that human freedom should not be interfered with, except by
such precautions as are necessary to prevent injury to society; but what
those precautions are, in this particular case, is precisely the
question to be discussed, and it can only be determined justly or
expediently by the joint experience, and with the full force and
well-considered concurrence, of both sexes.

Monsieur—

Je me félicite de ce que vous avez bien voulu exprimer une opinion
favorable de la notice que j’ai publiée de votre très remarquable
ouvrage.2 Edition: current; Page: [1752] Je sais combien cette notice
est insuffisante mais j’ai voulu, au premier moment possible, attirer
l’attention des hommes éclairés sur un livre dont la publication en
France me paraît destinée à faire époque. Votre livre n’a pas besoin
d’être interprété. Il suffit qu’on le lise, car vous possédez parmi tant
d’autres qualités, le génie de la clarté.

Quant à notre différence d’opinion, pour approfondir il faudrait entrer
très à fond dans la théorie de ce qu’on peut nommer l’idéalisation d’une
conception d’expérience; comme une ligne droite géométrique est
l’idéalisation des lignes droites de nos sens. Cette conception
idéalisée n’en est pas moins, comme vous l’admettez, un produit de
l’expérience; mais vous dites qu’elle ressemble aux produits chimiques
et que ses propriétés ne peuvent être connues que par l’observation
directe. Je pourrais, peut-être, contester cela, et soutenir que c’est
là l’une des différences entre une conception idéalisée et une
conception comparée: mais même en admettant votre opinion, on peut dire
que cette observation directe ne pourrait nous révéler que les
propriétés du produit regardé comme conception mentale, c. à. d. des
faits psychologiques, et qu’elle ne nous dit rien sur les lois générales
de l’univers.

Ceci soit dit seulement pour vous mettre sur la voie que je pourrais
suivre en combattant le système de [?] vous [?] deux derniers chapitres.
Il ne me paraît pas essentiel, quant à présent, que cette différence
d’opinion soit vuidée entre nous. Les experts la jugeront et je voulus
n’en dire dans ma notice que ce qu’il fallait pour attirer là-dessus
leur attention.

July 25. 1870

Sir—

I shall feel obliged by you laying before the Assessment Committee this
my appeal against the increase of the valuation of my house in
Blackheath Park to £180 Gross & £150 rateable value.

Edition: current; Page: [1753]
The rent I pay for the house is £150 with an additional £3.17.0 for
insurance. But the continual cracking of the walls owing to the settling
of the house from defect in the foundations causes incessant expenses
falling little if at all short of half the rent. I have been under the
necessity of twice underpinning the house, & during the ten years ending
with 1869 it has cost me in absolutely indispensable repairs £422.19.4
in bricklayer’s bills alone, besides heavy bills of carpenters,
plasterers, painters, paperhangers, plumbers & even glaziers, consequent
on the unequal sinking of the house. This expenditure I can substantiate
by vouchers, and the most cursory inspection of the house will shew it
to be in need of much further expense of a similar nature at the present
time.

A few years ago the Assessment Committee of the Lewisham Union gave me
notice of their having raised the valuation of my house, but on
representation from me of the continual & heavy expense of necessary
repairs they reduced the rateable valuation to £100 per annum at which
it has since stood & at which I hope it may be allowed to remain.

Dear Mr. Fawcett—

Sir Charles Dilke ended the note in which he told me of your wish to
make a public demonstration on the war,2 by asking me, if I disapproved
of it, to write to you; and therefore I have not written to you.

I highly approve of having a demonstration, and I hope there will be
many of them. For myself, I do not wish for the present to appear in any
way in the matter. A time may come when it will be the duty of every one
to speak out. But, while I do all I can in private, I think it best for
the present, both for Edition: current; Page: [1754] public and for
private reasons, that my name should not appear.3 This letter therefore
is confidential. In the meantime I think the points of most importance
are, that the English public should know, and shew that it knows, that
this war has been brought on wholly by Napoleon: that the Prussians are
fighting for their own liberty and for that of Europe: that England is
bound to protect Belgium, and that our utmost efforts can only, if
Napoleon lives, defer war, not prevent it. Our turn must come.
Therefore, that our people ought to arm at once, taking the
responsibility off the Government, which is right to be prudent and
silent. The Volunteers ought to be armed with the newest and best rifle
by public subscription. It is not a time for talking about peace and the
horrors of war when our national existence may be soon at stake. At the
same time it is wrong to attribute this war to France. Neither in
justice nor in prudence ought we to do so. The Germans are right in
saying that it is Napoleon, and not France, they are fighting, and
Napoleon, if he lives, and is successful in humbling Prussia, will
attack England, the fourth of the great powers that fought at Waterloo.

Aug. 4, 1870

Dear Bain—

I am much obliged to you for your letter which though it does not remove
my difficulties affords material which may perhaps help me towards
resolving them.2

How do we know that any energy has ever been expended in “separating the
masses to the distance at which they begin to gravitate towards each
other”? The new theory of the universe in relation to Force shews the
same tendency from all past time to draw the masses nearer to one
another instead of separating them, to which it is supposed that the
present order of the universe will finally succumb. If by the masses are
meant the molecules, & if what you say refers to the separation into
different stellar bodies by cooling, of what was originally a nebula; I
would say that the molecules of the nebula must have already gravitated
towards one another. If they were ever too close together to do so, how
have they ever emerged from that state? I cannot see what preexisting
force can have been hoarded by gravitation.

“Elimination” in the chemical application which you mention, still seems
to mean only getting rid of, and not picking out & retaining.3

If the old corporations retain and exercise the power of granting to
women a complete medical education & if they can be induced to confer on
those who avail themselves of it medical degrees, it is probable that
the examining body to be created by the new medical bill would not be
permitted by opinion to refuse them the license to practice.4 The bill I
see is withdrawn so that there will be time to look into the subject.

The Woman’s Suffrage Committee is desirous of finding competent persons
who would be willing to go to different places to speak at public
meetings, help to form local committees &c. The Committee would
remunerate them for their time & trouble. Are there any of your former
pupils or other intelligent persons known to you who you think would be
willing to cooperate with the Committee in this manner?

Edition: current; Page: [1756]
You have no doubt received the new programme agreed to at the General
Meeting of the Land Tenure Association. There are still great
difficulties made about the 4th article,5 that which relates to the
unearned increase of rent, but these generally gave way after
explanation & discussion as far as regards individual conviction; the
objectors still thinking it premature & injudicious to include that
point in the programme. There is however no hope of obtaining any
support to the Assn from the leaders of the working classes without
going at least as far as the fourth article goes in the way of a
compromise with their larger projects. All that seems feasible is to get
this part of the programme well explained, so as to meet such of the
objections as are founded only on misapprehension.

Dear Sir—

I am sorry to hear that your progress towards recovery is so slow. There
can be little doubt that rest from the exertion of the brain is the real
cure, & this is seldom to be had except by the substitution of gentle &
unexhausting excitement for that which is more severe. The mind flies
back to its old occupations unless it obtains new.

What the working men of London aim at under the name of nationalization
of the land, is nothing less than the entire abolition of private
property in land, the State taking possession of all the land (at a
valuation) & managing it as the public estate. As a step to this it is
proposed by some of them to prevent all future purchase of land by
private individuals, those who wish to sell being required to sell to
the State.

With regard to the reasons that you give for thinking that the increased
value of land is no more than a fair equivalent for landlords’
improvements, I expect that when the question becomes a serious one, a
Commission will have to be appointed to collect all facts which have any
important bearing on the subject.

make me anything but favourably inclined to the interference of Govt to
shield individuals from the consequences of their own unfortunate
speculations, it does appear to me that the Bombay Govt not only by the
gross misconduct of the official directors & its own neglect to look
after them but also by its course of conduct after the evil had become a
matter of notoriety, has incurred a very grave moral responsibility to
the shareholders; & that it cannot relieve itself from this except by
taking on itself some pecuniary responsibility.

Dear Sir—

I beg to acknowledge your letter of Aug. 10 & the pamphlet2 to which it
refers.

I am entirely in favour of retaining our connexion with the colonies so
long as they do not desire separation. And I think the nation is of the
same opinion, & would not tolerate, in the Government, any conduct which
it believed to proceed from a desire to break the connexion. But I
confess I do not think it likely that a periodical meeting of delegates
from all the colonies & dependencies with no substantive powers, merely
for the purpose of discussion, would excite sufficient interest in those
countries to become a useful institution. What a colony desires from the
mother country is generally something having reference to its own
special wants, & which it would probably, in general, prefer to discuss
singly with the Govt which has the power of decision. The participation
of numerous delegates from other communities with no interest in the
particular question, communities whose wants are different & who have
little fellow feeling, would, I should think, be more likely to be felt
as an incumbrance than desired as a help.

Allow me to express my surprise that one who attaches so much importance
as you do to the mere public discussion of subjects by those who are
specially interested in them, should see no use in the admission into
the H. of Edition: current; Page: [1759] C. of representative working
men. Their presence there seems to me indispensable to a sufficient
discussion of public interests from the particular point of view of the
working classes; which assuredly is not less worthy of being considered,
nor has fewer truths mingled with its errors, than the points of view of
the other classes now so superabundantly represented in Parliament. The
“Parliamentary tone” does not seem to me to be at present so elevated as
to be in any danger of being lowered by the admission of such men as Mr
Odger3 into a House a majority of whom seem to me to be abundantly
endowed with all the characteristics you ascribe to him, except the
“considerable mental vigour” for which you give him credit. The result I
shd expect from bringing contrary prejudices face to face & compelling
them to listen to one another would be a great improvement on both
sides: & in my own experience the working classes are not those who have
shown least willingness to be improved by such collisions.

Dear Mr Taylor—

I have the highest admiration for Mazzini,2 & although I do not
sympathize with his mode of working I do not take upon myself to
criticize it, because I do not doubt that to him is mainly owing the
unity & freedom of Italy. Nor do I in the least doubt the reality of the
danger your letter speaks of. But the real safeguard against that danger
lies in the fact that the whole Italian people, friends & enemies, are
assuredly fully aware of it, & that the Italian Govt must be fully aware
that if any mischief happens to M. while under their custody no one in
Italy will attribute it to natural causes. On the other hand, nothing
whatever would persuade any but a few rare scattered English people that
any such danger exists at all. To say so would simply be to expose
oneself in England to the imputation fully believed by those who make
it, of being a rabid & fanatical partisan: whereas in Italy Edition:
current; Page: [1760] the mildest & most moderate people will believe it
even if it is not true. Hence I am sure that it would be impossible to
bring the influence of English public opinion to bear in this matter. To
attempt to do so would simply be to call forth such honest & genuine
expressions of incredulity as might even convince the Italian Govt of
what they would otherwise never suspect—that if M. dies in prison the
English public may really not be sure that he was poisoned.

The safety of M. depends on the fear that his death might arouse feeling
in Italy dangerous to those in whose hands he is. As I believe this to
be the case, I think in all human probability the Govt will be very
desirous of avoiding anything of the sort & of setting him free as soon
as they conveniently can. Some action on the part of English liberals to
request his liberation on grounds of humanity, his age, his health, &c.,
might, a little time hence, give an excuse to the Govt they might be
glad to take to set him free. At present I fear they would not think it
prudent to do it.

Were I an English personal friend of Mazzini I shd certainly endeavour
to obtain access to him,3 for I think the greatest danger at present is
of his fretting himself into an illness, which in the hands of Italian
doctors might naturally terminate fatally. The presence of a real friend
might be of great use to him, & as English people’s word is generally
believed, the Italian Govt might more easily permit English than Italian
friends to see him, since they might trust them better to do nothing
that they undertook not to do.

Dear Sir—

I so far agree with the promoters of the meeting to which you do me the
honour of inviting me, as to be very desirous to see a movement
commenced for the thorough military training of the general population.
I wish the mass of soldiers to be identical with the mass of citizens, &
standing armies Edition: current; Page: [1761] to be eventually
dispensed with, except the scientific corps, & probably a permanent
staff of carefully trained officers, not taken as at present from one
class of the community, but from all.

But I do not agree with what seems to be implied in a “Protest against
this country being brought into the war.”

To declare beforehand that no amount of iniquity perpetrated before our
eyes, shall induce us to go to war, would be the surest way of
encouraging wars abroad, and would infallibly, like all other
selfishness & cowardice, finally redound to our own cost. If war between
nations is ever to be put an end to, it can only be as war between
individuals has been checked in civilised societies—by the creation of a
police & an impartial umpire to settle quarrels. To create such a system
it is necessary that all courageous & right feeling men shd be ready to
suffer in protecting the weak in politics as they ought to be in civil
life. And to stand by & see a free & civilised [right loving?] nation,
such as Belgium, which appeals to us for help, deprived of its liberties
by overpowering force, would be to set an example as injurious to the
best hopes of civilization as it would be base & pusillanimous. What is
necessary to prevent the generous spirit of the nation from being abused
to bad purposes & leading either to iniquities or to unnecessary wars is
that the nation itself shd closely watch its governors, shd refuse to
enter into any war which does not approve itself to its conscience as
just, & shd steadily in time of peace as in time of war examine into &
control all the military expenditure & organisation.

I have put down these few remarks for yourself & the Committee, but I
shd be obliged by your not giving any further publicity to them.

Mon cher d’Eichthal

Merci d’avoir pensé à moi dans un temps si douloureux. Depuis longtemps
je suis arrivé à la triste conviction que malgré l’incontestable réalité
des progrès modernes, nous ne sommes pas encore à l’abri des grands
malheurs et des grands crimes que notre siècle se flattait d’être
parvenu à bannir de la terre. Je plains profondément le peuple français,
qui n’est pas responsable de tout ceci, qui n’aime pas et n’a pas voulu
la guerre, et qui est condamné à la payer du meilleur de son sang, et
peut-être d’une humiliation nationale la plus Edition: current; Page:
[1762] difficile à supporter. Pourvu que l’Europe, et surtout la France,
apprenne de ces tristes événements, que lorsqu’un peuple abdique la
direction de ses propres destinées, et se résigne à ce qu’un
gouvernement fasse de lui un simple instrument de sa volonté, il est
condamné à supporter toutes les conséquences de ce qu’il a laissé faire
en son nom; et qu’un gouvernement qui par les conditions de son
existence a besoin de tout ce qu’il y a de plus malhonnête et de plus
corrompu dans le pays, finit par être trompé par eux, au point que même
son appui de prédilection, l’administration militaire, se trouve pourrie
et en décomposition au moment du besoin.

Quelles que puissent être pour la France les suites immédiates de ces
événements, il ne lui faudra pas beaucoup d’années pour redevenir tout
aussi grande qu’auparavant. Mais elle devra se contenter d’être l’une
des grandes puissances de l’Europe, sans prétendre à être la seule, ou
même la première: il lui faudra reconnaître pour les relations
internationales comme pour celles de la vie civile, le règle de
l’égalité. La prétention d’un pays quelconque à être tellement au dessus
des autres pour que rien d’important ne se fasse sans le consulter, ne
peut plus se soutenir aujourd’hui, et la France devrait voir dans la
répudiation universelle d’une telle prétention, le triomphe du principe
qui fait sa propre gloire.

J’espère qu’au moins vous n’aurez pas d’autres malheurs que le désastre
public à déplorer, et que la guerre épargnera toute votre famille.

Je suis arrivé ici huit ou dix jours avant la déclaration de guerre,2
alors qu’un pareil coup semblait presque aussi peu probable que la
destruction de Paris par un tremblement de terre. La rapidité
foudroyante des grands événements d’aujourd’hui n’est pas ce qu’ils ont
de moins étonnant.

Sept. 7. 1870

Dear Sir—

The question respecting the expediency of making the sale of instruments
of war by neutrals to belligerents an offence against the law of
Edition: current; Page: [1763] nations, is a difficult one, & though I
have given it some consideration I cannot say that I have arrived at a
positive opinion. Your paper2 will probably assist me in forming one.

About one thing I feel quite clear; that the matter ought not to depend,
as it does by our present laws, on the discretion of the executive. For
the sake both of principle & of policy the question shd be determined by
law. And it cannot well be determined by law without a previous
agreement among the principal nations; since otherwise we should either
be adjudging to ourselves rights which might not improbably be disputed,
or acknowledging obligations which might not be reciprocated.

On the rule itself, there is a conflict of considerations. On the one
hand real neutrality seems to me to consist in not aiding either side
with means of carrying on the contest: including under “means,” any
articles of which the sole, or at all events the principal, use, is for
warlike purposes. On the other hand, it is generally, though not
universally, true that the party most benefitted by, because most
needing, supplies from neutral countries, is the weaker of the
belligerents, who is the more likely to be the oppressed or injured
party; including among the rest all who are in arms, on however just
provocation, against their own government. It is significant that the
only case in which the power given to our own executive in this matter
has been acted on (the case of the Greeks & Turks) is of this last
description.

A further consideration is the difficulty of preventing exportation to
the belligerent countries without stopping exportation altogether. It
would be of little use to prevent guns being sent to Dunkirk if they can
be sent to Ostend & from thence find their way into France. But this
only amounts to saying that it is of no use for one country to act on
the rule unless it is adopted generally. If it were so adopted, the
Belgian Govt would be responsible for preventing the guns exported to
Ostend from entering France.

On the whole, I incline most to leaving the exportation free, but not
without misgiving; for when the access to foreign supplies operates as
it generally does, unequally upon the two belligerents, it seems to me
hardly possible that the public opinion of the party suffering shd not
regard the professing neutral as substantially an ally of the enemy; &
perhaps with still greater resentment as one who without any ground of
quarrel seeks to make profit by a neighbour’s misfortunes.

There is but too much ground for your apprehensions as to the feelings
likely to be left by this war;3 but if it had been unattended with a
great & Edition: current; Page: [1764] decisive success on either side,
it would probably have been much more prolonged, & the case is
preeminently one in which the shortest evil is the best. Then too it was
important that a striking retribution shd fall on the aggressor [in] an
unprovoked war. It is the justice of their cause which has roused the
whole German people & given them this irresistible might. But it is
deplorable to think that the French nation may from a false point of
honour, persist in an unjust war which they neither originated nor
desired.

Sept. 15. 1870

Dear Mr Cairnes

I think your article2 very good, and likely to be useful. It is very
complete in the logical, and also in the purely economical, point of
view. Some other time perhaps you might find it useful to carry on the
examination of Bastiat’s doctrines to the social, or practical, point of
view, and shew how far from the truth it is that the economic phenomena
of society as at present constituted always arrange themselves
spontaneously in the way which is most for the common good or that the
interests of all classes are fundamentally the same. There is not,
however, room to do this in addition to what you have already so
conclusively done, and I should not recommend attempting it. I have
therefore sent on the proof to Virtue,3 after correcting two or three
typographical errors which had escaped your notice.

The events in Europe are indeed overwhelming. What will be the end of
them no one can foresee. But it is melancholy to see that the French,
even those who opposed the war, have not the magnanimity or the common
justice to feel and admit that they are responsible to their neighbours
for injuries done by any one whom they allow to govern them; and instead
of making reparation to Germany for perhaps the most unprovoked attack
in modern Edition: current; Page: [1765] European history, and for the
myriads of lives which have had to be sacrificed in repelling that
attack, they think it fine to persist in the injury, and to slaughter
more and more of those against whom they are already such deep
offenders.

Thornton’s article4 is, as you say, very weak; but metaphysical subjects
are not among his strong points. You have laid your finger very
precisely upon one of the principal of his many fallacies.5 All he says
is answered by anticipation in Bentham’s Introduction to Morals and
Legislation,6 and in my father’s Fragment on Mackintosh.7

I should be happy to give copies of my “System of Logic” to some of the
Institutions you refer to if you would let me know what are those where
you think it would be valued.2 The degree in which these copies are read
by working men would be some indicator of the degree of utility of a
cheap edition.

What sort of price would in your opinion meet the requisites of a cheap
edition of such a book as the System of Logic?3 I must however add that
in permitting Edition: current; Page: [1766] a cheap edition I am simply
sacrificing nearly the whole of any profits made by my work, even if the
sale is very considerable. No cheap edition of a serious work appears
ever to pay the author anything more than a trifle. If the sale is
likely to be large among really working class people, that is to say if
many persons are really benefitted by my sacrifice I am willing to make
the sacrifice of my own profit for their benefit. But unless the sale is
largely increased I am not sure that it is the best use I can make of
the money. I am not sure even whether the same amount of money might not
be better spent in making presents of gratuitous copies of the library

TO SIR CHARLES WENTWORTH DILKE1

Blackheath Park

Kent

Sept. 30. 1870

My dear Sir Charles Dilke

On the first of the points mentioned in your note, I think that the
Government of National Defence,2 being to all appearances obeyed as the
Government of the country by all parts of France which are not in the
power of a foreign army, ought to be recognised officially (it is
already recognised semiofficially) as the de facto Government by Great
Britain:3 which recognition I understand to consist in giving to our
ambassador new credentials, addressed to the new authorities. I think
that what was done in the case of the Provisional Government of 1848
should be done in the present case.4 But, after Gladstone’s answer to
the deputation,5 I do not think that there is any chance of inducing him
to do this.

Edition: current; Page: [1767]
The second point6 I cannot see in the same light. The Germans have a
very strong case. One of the wickedest acts of aggression in history,
has been by them successfully repelled, but at the expense of the bitter
suffering of many thousand (one might almost say million) households.
They have a just claim to as complete a security as any practicable
arrangement can give, against the repetition of a similar crime.
Unhappily, the character and feelings of the French nation, or at least
of the influential and active portion of all political parties, afford
no such security. I feel, with you, a strong repugnance to the transfer
of a population from one government to another unless by its own
expressed desire. If I could settle the terms of peace, the disputed
territory should be made into an independent self governing state, with
power to annex itself, after a long period (say fifty years), either to
France or to Germany; a guarantee for that term of years by the neutral
powers (which removes in some measure the objection to indefinite
guarantees), or if that could not be obtained, the fortresses being
meanwhile garrisoned by German troops. But there may be many objections
to this which I do not see; and at all events, our Government would
probably suggest it in vain. Our Government is not likely to have the
smallest influence at present with Germany. English public opinion might
have some little influence. But all demonstrations of the kind seem only
likely to encourage France in a hopeless struggle.

If Gladstone had been a great man, this war would never have broken out,
for he would have nobly taken upon himself the responsibility of
declaring that the English navy should actively aid whichever of the two
powers was attacked by the other. This would have been a beginning of
the international police we are calling for. I do not much blame
Gladstone for not daring to do it, for it requires a morally braver man
than any of our statesmen to run this kind of risk.

I have willingly given you my opinion on the points on which you ask it,
but I do not wish any public use made of it with my name, as I have no
desire to put myself or be put forward in the matter; for public opinion
in England appears to me on the whole so reasonable and well intentioned
on the subject, as to be likely ultimately to arrive at a right
conclusion; and I am not sure whether we have really yet sufficient data
as to the mere facts, to entitle us to form a very definite opinion. I

Je n’ai pas eu le coeur de répondre à votre lettre du 26 Sept. parceque

pèse sur la France.

Aujourd’hui votre voeu pour une médiation anglaise semble être exaucé,2

Ici la sympathie pour les malheurs de la France est grande, et le désir
est général qu’elle sorte de cette crise aux conditions les plus
favorables que comportent les circonstances. Mais on ne pense pas moins
qu’elle doit une grande réparation à l’Allemagne pour les vastes
sacrifices de son sang le plus précieux qu’une agression injuste lui a
imposés. Et l’on craint que cette facilité à croire ce qui est agréable,
et à résister à l’évidence des faits, qui est propre aux habitudes du
français ne leur fasse refuser des propositions supportables, pour être
réduits à subir plus tard des conditions encore plus rigoureuses. Si le
patriotisme éclairé de tout ce qu’il y a de meilleur en France pouvait
décider les classes lettrés de la nation à voir dans les sacrifices qui
sont devenus inévitables, une leçon pour ne plus jamais se laisser aller
à préférer des rêves d’agrandissement au dehors, à la recherche de la
liberté et du progrès moral et social au dedans et pouvait décider
l’immense majorité de la nation à ne se laisser gouverner que par

I have no improvements to suggest in your paper on elections to the

objections are much less strong than in the case of elections to
Parliament and are perhaps outweighed by the advantages in this and
other elections for local purposes.

By whom, and how, is the Committee of Selection in the City appointed? I
am glad that Ellis3 is a member of it; but he ought to be in the School
Board himself, as well as you.

What you say of the general indifference to considerations of special
qualification, is painfully confirmed by other testimony. The leaders,
however, of the working classes do not seem to share this indifference:
it was much complained of at a meeting of the Representative Reform
Association last Saturday4 in which Odger, Mottershead,5 and Lloyd
Jones6 took an active part; and the response was general to what I and
others said of the bad quality of the instruction.

You, of all men, ought to be on the Board, and I will certainly urge

Dear Sir—

I have not a copy of the Act2 by me, but I have always understood that
the prohibition of payment had reference only to payment out of taxes,
rates, or any public fund. I do not believe that there exists any legal
obstacle to payment of the representatives by their constituents, as the
Trades Unions pay their officers & delegates. It would not cost the
Trade Societies of Manchester much to pay, if necessary, to those
working men whom you may succeed in electing, the weekly wages which
they would earn if they worked at their ordinary employment. There
appears to me, however, a more serious difficulty. If really, as you
say, the working men will not have confidence in Edition: current; Page:
[1772] any man as a real working man, who has saved enough to be
independent or who can spare even a portion of his time from earning his
daily bread, it would appear that the moment they have elected a man
they must lost confidence in him if he is to be supported by
subscription, since from the moment when he is so supported he ceases to
be a working man. I shd have thought it had been the first object of all
who have the interest of the working classes at heart, that some among
the working men whose talents or good fortune enable them to be
pecuniarily better off than the majority of their companions, shd
continue to be, & to be considered, still members of the working
classes. But if they are to be looked on with suspicion & dislike, this
cannot be the case. It has always been my hope that the working classes
might come to have a moderate portion of leisure, & I shd regard it as a
great misfortune if the moment a working man is able to attain this he
shd lose the confidence of his fellow workmen unless he is dependent on
their bounty. It cannot be impossible that a working man shd retain the
principles which are honestly entertained by so many individuals among
the richest classes of the country, merely because he has been able to
become a master workman, or a writer, &c. &c, & as he will if he has
been born & has generally lived among the working classes, understand &
sympathize with them better than most persons of other classes can do, I
think such a man shd be trusted till he has proved himself unworthy of
trust. Doubtless many men will do so, as many men in every rank shew
when put to the test that their real motives for entering into public
life were vanity or self interest, but I cannot believe that a larger
proportion of men mainly inspired by such unworthy motives will be found
among the self-raised men of the working classes than among the
self-raised men of the leading mercantile, manufacturing, literary, and
others.

me know when. As I understand you have not a home in London now, we have
a bed at your disposal when you come down here.

I am glad to see you have not yielded to the utterly false & mistaken
sympathy with France4 & indeed I go farther than you do on the other
side. Stern justice is on the side of the Germans, & it is in the best
interests of France itself that a bitter lesson shd now be inflicted
upon it, such as it can neither deny nor forget in the future. The whole
writing, thinking, & talking portion of the people undoubtedly share the
guilt of L. Napoleon, the moral guilt of the war, & feel neither shame
nor contrition at anything but the unlucky results to themselves.
Undoubtedly the real nation, the whole mass of the Edition: current;
Page: [1775] people, are perfectly guiltless of it; but then they are so
ignorant that they will allow the talkers & writers to lead them into
just such corners again if they do not learn by bitter experience what
will be the practical consequences of their political indifference. The
peasantry of France like the women of England have still to learn that
politics concern themselves. The loss of Alsace & Lorraine will perhaps
be about as painless a way of learning this lesson as could possibly be
devised.5

As I intend to publish the inclosed2 or something like it in one of the
papers I send it to you first to know whether you think it best that I
shd send it first to the Times through yourself. I almost take it for
granted that you are of my way of thinking in the matter & that the
articles in the Times3 I so strongly object to cannot be yours. If you
think it best that it shd find its way to the Times merely through the
post might I ask you to be kind enough to close it & drop it into a
letter box to save the time that would be lost in returning it to me as
I intend to send it to the Times before sending it elsewhere, in case
they think fit to insert it.

Dear Mr Fawcett

You will be glad to hear, if you have not already heard, that the
Commons Committee yesterday acted in the spirit of your telegram, by
determining to bring in their own Epping Forest Bill in the approaching
session, whether the Government bring in theirs or not.2 It was also
determined to take up the subject of the New Forest, and that of the
preservation of footpaths, with a view, on the latter subject, of
getting the power of stopping paths put into better hands.

The newspapers are raging and blustering on the subject of Russia,3 in a
manner which will be very dangerous, if the Government and the House of
Commons once think that their ravings express the opinion of the
country. Writers who for many months have never ceased sounding an alarm
about our total want of preparation for a war even of self
defence—telling us that we have neither troops, nor horses, nor guns,
nor officers, nor organisation, nor men capable of giving us these
things—all, I believe, too true—now demand that we should instantly say
to Russia, Retract that declaration, or War: and when Russia refuses (as
what power, in such a case, would not refuse?) we are to go to war with
Russia at once, and as they themselves think not improbable, with
Prussia too. And all this, for what? Because Russia shakes off an
obligation which, though it may sometimes perhaps be rightly imposed as
a temporary penalty for unprovoked aggression, no nation can ever be
expected permanently to submit to. One would think such a thing had
never happened before, as that a nation on whom hard terms had been
imposed by victorious enemies, has ever treated them as no longer
binding after she had recovered her strength. The truth is, such things
are often happening, and must often be submitted to, when the object
itself is not worth a war; and so it will be, until treaties are
concluded, as they ought to be, for terms of years only, instead of
affecting to be perpetual. Will any one pretend that a nation can bind
its posterity for all time by the conditions to which it has been forced
to submit at a moment of difficulty? If not, such stipulations, unless
they still remain in themselves desirable, must be allowed to become
obsolete; and the only questions are, after what lapse of time, and
under Edition: current; Page: [1777] what conditions; questions which no
one, I believe, is yet prepared to answer. Strength and opportunity have
always decided them hitherto.

When we consider that England might have done the inestimable service to
mankind of preventing the present terrible war,4 if we had chosen to run
a very slight risk of being involved in it ourselves; the proposal that
after shrinking from this, we should rush precipitately into war to
limit the number of Russian ships of war in the Euxine, shews a degree
of criminal fatuity almost greater than that of Louis Napoleon and his
advisers, four months ago. I am

Dear Mr Morley—

We congratulate you very heartily upon your marriage,2 of which it gives
us great pleasure to hear. Home life is the best possible “milieu” for
work, & I hope you will be able to subordinate your work to the claims
of your health, a task however which is found very difficult by
everybody who can & will work well.

I am very anxious just now that there shd be some proper protest against
the infatuation of our press on the Russian question.3 I can compare it
to nothing but the infatuation of the French press which we have all
been wondering at. Almost in the same breath in which our journals tell
us only too truly that we are utterly unprepared for war, nay unprepared
for the most essential defence, they call upon us to declare war with
one of the most powerful military empires of the world—a naval power
too, & that at the very same time that our quarrel with America is still
pending.4 So much for their common sense. As for the rights of the
question, it is doubtful whether they are not substantially on the side
of Russia. At all events we are not bound in honour to attempt to carry
out the Treaty when our most important co-signatory can give no help.5
Least of all are we bound in honour to insist Edition: current; Page:
[1778] upon the perpetual adhesion to a treaty which in all probability
we ought to be ready to abrogate. As for the argument that Russia is
simply casting off all treaty obligations, that simply points to the
fact that all such obligations always have been disowned directly the
party unwillingly bound by them perceives a relaxation of force in the
powers which attempted to bind it. This will always happen so long as
treaties are made in perpetuity. Were they terminable, as they ought to
be, those who object to them would have a rational hope of escape in
some more moral way than an appeal to the same brute force which imposed
them. It points also to the inherent weakness of the scheme of joint
treaties & guarantees which must of their own nature fall to pieces
directly there is any great change in the conditions or the relations of
the joint powers. This treaty of 1856 shd have been allowed to fall into
disuse. That it has not been so allowed is a legacy of the evil
Palmerstonian days. Now, I conceive that the only dignified thing for us
to do is to let the treaty be abrogated by Russia with a protest
reserving our own liberty of action. The way in which Guizot dealt with
the annexation of Cracow6 is a case in point & would form a very good
precedent for us in this matter.

We shall hope to see you on Tuesday next as you say in the forenoon.
There is a train at 35 min. past 12 from Ch. X,7 by which perhaps you
can come & take luncheon with us.

B[lackheath] P[ark]

Nov. 19. 1870

Dear Mr Courtney—

I thank you very much for your kindness about my letter.2

I perfectly understand that what you & other thoughtful men, regard as
the important point in this matter is the declaration of the Russian
Govt that it intends to throw off one of the obligations of the Treaty,3
without asking the consent of the other contracting parties. My
position, however, is that it is not every breach of treaty that
requires to be, or that ought to be, resented by war. The fons et origo
mali is the great error of concluding treaties Edition: current; Page:
[1779] in perpetuity, instead of only for a term of years; which, by
making it inevitable and sometimes even a duty to break treaties,
creates that conflict of possible obligations which both fosters &
shields unconscientiousness. No treaty is fit to be perpetual. When,
however, a treaty is an amicable contract between nations for their
joint advantage, it is in most cases possible to get necessary
modifications effected by joint consent. But it is not, & never has been
thought to be so in the case of treaties which are real
capitulations—terms of peace imposed by victors on the vanquished
expressly because known to be disadvantageous to them. Even such
treaties if they were temporary might be kept. But when no term is fixed
for their expiration these treaties—those conditions of them especially
which directly restrain the freedom of action of the country—always have
been & always are violated as soon as the nation on whom they are
imposed is able & willing to risk another war. And such violation is
habitually condoned, unless the other parties to the violated treaty
think the particular object worth a war. Was there ever a more direct
violation of a treaty to which all the powers of Europe were parties,4
than was committed by France when she placed another Bonaparte on the
throne? But what country dreamed of going to war with France to prevent
or chastise that breach of engagement? Instances more or less similar
are too frequent in recent history for it to be necessary to enumerate
them; but there is one worth mentioning because it affords a precedent
applicable to the present case. When Russia, Austria, & Prussia combined
in violation of treaties, to destroy the Republic of Cracow & annex it
to Austria,5 Guizot was foreign minister of France. He made a public
declaration, I do not remember if it was by a circular to his diplomatic
agents or by a speech in the Chamber, or by both, that France took
notice of this breach of treaties; that she did not intend to take any
active measures in opposition to it; but that she reserved to herself
the exercise of all such rights as the violation without her consent of
a treaty to which she was a party, in her judgment restored to her. It
seems to me that something similar to this is the only wise & dignified
course for the English Govt to take: unless indeed the repudiated
engagement be such as it would enforce de novo if the thing were res
integra, & that too at the cost of a war under the most disadvantageous
& perilous circumstances: but as you, in common I shd think with all
rational persons who know anything of the subject, totally reject this
supposition, I need not discuss it.

As for Mr Forster, with the fullest respect for his many excellent
qualities, Edition: current; Page: [1780] he is so hot headed a man—so
thorough a Quaker unfranchised6—that he needs little inducement to come
to blows. However I venture to think that he knows nothing whatever
about foreign politics. Excuse me for saying that you have not chosen
your instance well if you thought I shd think his opinion could add any
weight to yours.

Nov. 21. 1870

Dear Thornton—

I am very happy that you so entirely agree with me about this insane
clamour for war.2 I think there is a great deal in your argument. Even
were there no other reason the total inability of the most powerful of
Edition: current; Page: [1781] the parties to the treaty to do anything
towards enforcing it goes a very great way indeed to release the others
from any obligation they might have contracted to do so. Will you not
write a letter on the subject to one of the newspapers?3 Every
additional protest at this particular time is of great value by shewing
that Englishmen are not all mad together, & that those who determine
future opinion will pass a severe judgment on a government which should
sacrifice the safety of England to mere bluster & brag. To do the
present Govt justice however it is my belief that they only want support
from the public to shew themselves yielding & conciliatory; & therefore
we ought all the more to give public expression to this point of view.4
Those who pretend that we are bound by our engagements to go to war rely
chiefly on the tripartite treaty of England, France, & Austria. I send a
page of the Economist which contains it.5 By the first article those
powers guarantee, jointly & severally, not the Treaty with Russia, but
the integrity of the Ottoman Dominions. It cannot be pretended by any
one that this guarantee comes into force until Turkey is attacked. By
the second article, they engage to consider any infraction of the treaty
a casus belli: & if there are causes, to determine with Turkey & with
one another what it has become necessary to do. This merely promises
that when a case has arisen which gives them a right to go to war, they
will take counsel together whether to do so or not. But a still plainer
point is that by this Treaty the three powers did not bind themselves to
Turkey at all. Turkey was not a party to the Treaty. They bound
themselves only to one another, & can therefore release one another from
the engagement. More, since one of the three, France, cannot possibly
fulfil that engagement it cannot require the others to do so, nor is
there the least probability that Austria will make any such requirement
from us while even if she did the practical impossibility of attaining
the end without the aid of France would be a full justification for
non-compliance, even in the case of the 1st article, much more in that
of the second. It is perhaps also worth mentioning, for the sake of the
completeness of the argument, that this very condition of the
neutralization of the Black Sea has been already broken through by the
U. S. & that on that occasion none of the contracting parties to the
Treaty thought fit even to protest.

With regard to Utilitarianism,6 you have not said anything yet which
would give to the most irrational or most irritable person living
anything to “forgive.” But were you to attack my book or my arguments
with any amount of severity I shd only see in the attack, coming from
one of whose friendship I am so certain, an additional proof of
friendship. Of course one is more glad Edition: current; Page: [1782]
when a friend agrees with one in opinion than when he differs, unless he
brings one over to his opinion. This you have not done, as yet. I think
you will find all your arguments answered in Bentham’s Introduction to
the Principles of Morals & Legislation7 or in my father’s Fragment on
Mackintosh,8 long before I wrote anything on the subject.

We have had two very pleasant excursions, one on the Wye, & one through
Belgium & Germany to Geneva.9 From there Helen went on to Avignon to
fetch some of Buckle’s MSS, as we made up our minds that the posts
through France would be too irregular to enable her to carry on the
printing from there this winter.

During our journey along the Rhine & through Switzerland & my stay at
Geneva we had most exceptionally beautiful weather, seeing the scenery
more finely in some respects than we had ever done before: Indeed we had
never seen such magnificent autumn colouring; it reminded one of the
descriptions one reads of America. I return your letter in case you want
to use it in writing to any of the papers.

Dear Mr Fawcett

At the meeting of the Commons Preservation Committee yesterday, the
resolution to proceed with our Epping Forest Bill this year was, with my
full concurrence, rescinded.2 I am very sorry you were not there, but I
think, if you had been, you would have agreed with us. The principal
reason which decided my own opinion, was that the danger of being
thwarted by the Government would now be incurred by going on, not by
stopping short: for, the time for giving the first notices having
expired, the Government cannot now bring in a bad bill of their own this
session; but if we brought in ours, they would be enabled, and probably
induced, to turn our good bill into a bad one. Another reason is, that
our Solicitor says the fight would cost us some £5000, a sum we have not
got and do not expect to get. There were some Edition: current; Page:
[1783] minor reasons: particularly this, that bills have been prepared
to carry into effect the voluntary transfer of all Lord Spencer’s3
rights in Wandsworth and Wimbledon Commons to the public, for an annual
payment equal to what he now gets from them; and it is hoped that these
bills when actually passed will establish a precedent, and also make
other lords of manors more compliant when they see that Lord Spencer has
had to give up the attempt to enforce ulterior claims by law. I think
myself, that the public mind grows more favourable to us every year, and
that our agitation would be more effectual next year than this,
especially considering with what subjects the public mind is now
engrossed; and the New Forest bill of the Government will give a good
opportunity for putting forth right doctrines on the whole subject.

I am truly glad that you report so favourably of the opinion of the
Cambridge Liberals on the war frenzy. I think every day will now raise
up more resistance. Did you see the excellent letters of Cairnes and
Freeman in yesterday’s Daily News?4 I am myself writing something for
Morley on the subject.5 I shall be glad to hear what your correspondents

Dear Mr Morley,

I have been thinking much over our conversation when I last saw you, & I
feel so very strongly how wrong it is that your health shd be seriously
risked as I fear it is being, by the impossibility of putting the
Edition: current; Page: [1785] F[ortnightly] Review aside for a time
that if you cannot find any other friend to whom you would like to
confide it, & if you think it would be possible for me to do it for you
in a satisfactory manner temporarily, I shd be very happy to do what I
can. We do not intend in any case to leave England until my daughter has
finished, or very nearly finished, her task with Mr B’s MSS.,2 & as her
health only permits her to work very slowly she has no expectation that
this will be for many months. The books & MSS she is obliged to refer to
are so voluminous that they cannot well be carried about. They must be
worked at at home, & as the stoppage or uncertainty of the French posts3
debars her from doing it at Avignon, we intend to remain here till it is
done. It would be some satisfaction if this circumstance shd enable me
to be of use to yourself; at all events shd other motives induce you to
accept my proposal, you need have no scruples on the score of keeping us
in England. I presume that the business part of the Review—money
matters, advertisements, printing &c.—are or could be deputed either to
the publisher or to some one who could act as man of business; & I shd
think that whoever this may be might in the event of my undertaking the
temporary editorship, write, under my directions, any letters that might
be absolutely essential to contributors, & might receive & send on to me
letters & articles. I could in that case undertake to read & judge of
the articles & take upon myself the literary editorship, & either
forward the letters to you or read them & forward only such as I might
think you ought to see. What I myself shd most shrink from in
undertaking such a thing, would be not the work of editing itself, but
the enormous increase of unnecessary correspondence which I fear I
should incur if it were generally known that I had undertaken it & on
this account I think it would be best for letters to be sent to the
publisher or some man of business, & for some one, other than myself, to
be the ostensible name in such correspondence as could not be carried on
by yourself. If you still continue to feel that an interval of at least
comparative leisure would be of benefit to you, & can make no more
satisfactory arrangement for the Review, I beg that you will not scruple
to avail yourself of any help it is in my power to give.

I returned the proof of my little article4 yesterday to the printers.

Monsieur—

Pardon du retard que j’ai mis à répondre à votre lettre, et qui ne fut
causé que par le manque de temps. Ce fut un véritable rafraîchissement
pour moi de recevoir de vous une pareille lettre au milieu d’événements
si malheureux, comme ce doit être pour vous même une grande consolation
que de pouvoir dans le malheur public vous rejeter sur la paisible étude
des grandes questions qui importent tant aux intérêts permanents du
genre humain.

J’ai très bonne opinion de l’ouvrage de M. Taine sur l’Intelligence,2
sauf les derniers chapitres où il me semble renier ses principes en
croyant pouvoir étendre les généralisations de l’expérience humaine à
des régions étrangères à cette expérience. Quant à la doctrine
communément dite matérialiste, c. à d. que toutes nos impressions
mentales résultent du jeu de nos organes physiques, Edition: current;
Page: [1787] je trouve comme vous que jusqu’ici ce n’est qu’une
hypothèse,3 puisqu’on n’a pas pu remplir la condition qu’exige une bonne
logique inductive dans la recherche des causes, en établissant que, la
cause donnée, l’effet a lieu. Pour cela il faudrait pouvoir fabriquer un
organisme, et essayer si cet organisme pense et sent. Dans ce cas-là on
saurait si les conditions organiques que nous savons être nécessaires à
la pensée, sont suffisantes pour la produire, si enfin ce sont de
véritables causes, ou seulement des accompagnements obligés.

Quant à la question du moi, je ne puis rien ajouter à ce que j’ai dit
làdessus dans le livre sur Hamilton. Je doute si cette question comporte
dans l’état actuel de nos connaissances une solution complète. Je suis
allé jusqu’où je pouvais aller et j’ai indiqué le point où s’arrête mon
analyse. Pour la question du sentiment moral il en est autrement, et je
crois que l’association en rend compte. Ce sentiment me paraît un
résultat très compliqué d’un grand nombre de sentiments plus
élémentaires. Mais la discussion de cette question serait impossible
dans les limites d’une lettre. Je pourrais vous nommer des livres
anglais où elle est bien traitée, mais ils ne sont pas encore traduits.
J’en ai touché un côté dans un petit livre qu’on a traduit en francais
“L’Utilitarisme”:4 je ne me souviens pas si je vous l’ai envoyé. Sinon,
veuillez me le dire et je vous ferai parvenir cette traduction lorsque
les communications avec Paris seront rouvertes.

Dear Sir

The chairman of the late meeting on Women’s Suffrage had already
conveyed to me the invitation which I have been honoured with, to attend
and address a meeting; but though it would give me much pleasure to do
so, I have been obliged to answer that my engagements do not admit of my
visiting Glasgow this winter.

I do not care much to discuss the C[ontagious] D[iseases] A[cts]2 with
yourself, because, being willing as you are to allow women their fair
share in electoral representation, you hold a perfectly defensible
position when you differ from them on a point of legislation which
concerns them. The position of those men, however, who, while they
refuse women any share in legislation, enact laws which apply to women
only, admittedly unpopular among women, is totally different from yours,
and appears to me as base as it is illogical, unless indeed they are
prepared to maintain that women have no other rights than the cattle
respecting whom a kindred Act has been passed.3 I fully agree with you
that the true fundamental point to be set right is the franchise. I
will, however, without referring to all the points in your argument
which I disagree with, note down one or two of my reasons for differing
with you on the main question.

1. There is very strong evidence that in the country (France) where
legislation similar to the C. D. A. has been long in force, and its full
effects have been produced, it increases the number of the class of
women to whom it applies. The comparative safety supposed to be given,
increases the demand, and the number of women temporarily removed from
the market makes vacancies in the supply which have to be, and are, made
up. This is not necessarily shown by statistical returns; inasmuch as
these can take no account of the great mass of clandestine prostitution,
practised in evasion of the law, and which, if prevented, could only be
so by a still more tyrannical use of the powers given to the police, and
by exposing respectable women to a still greater amount of injury and
indignity than at present.

2. No reason can be given for subjecting women to medical inspection
Edition: current; Page: [1790] which does not apply in a greater degree
to the men who consort with them. The process is painful, even
physically, and sometimes dangerous, to women—not at all so to men: and
it is idle to say that its application to men is impracticable: the same
kind and degree of espionage which detects a prostitute, could equally
detect the men who go with her. The law, being one-sided, inflicted on
women by men, and delivering over a large body of women intentionally,
and many other women unintentionally, to insulting indignity at the
pleasure of the police, has the genuine characteristics of tyranny.

You say that you think there is no weight in the objection that the law
applies to one sex only, inasmuch as enlistment does the same. I think
you will see that my replies are unanswerable. In the first place, the
laws that regulate enlistment are not made by women only, themselves not
liable to it, and then applied to men only, who have no voice in making
them; as is the case in those penalties, or discipline, proposed to be
applied to prostitutes by a legislature which neither consists of, nor
is elected by, any proportion of women. Moreover, so long as women who
offer themselves as soldiers are not accepted, the being a soldier must
be taken as a privilege, and not a penalty, of sex. If women were only
not soldiers because they are incapable of the fatigue and labour, then
those women who in men’s clothes have proved themselves capable would
not be ejected on their sex being discovered. So long as this is the
case, military service is as much a privilege of our aristocracy as it
is in Mahomedan countries where Christians are not allowed to serve. And
the discipline to which this aristocracy voluntarily submits itself
through the voice of a legislature which itself elects, cannot be
compared to the discipline inflicted by those who do not share it,
without the consent of those who are alone exposed to it.—Secondly, if
it was impossible for any man to expose himself to military discipline
without a woman as his companion, and if he, only, was liable to the
discipline and punishment, the case would be more nearly parallel. You
must remember that no woman can render herself liable as a prostitute
without a man for her accomplice: yet when it comes to the punishment,
or, if you prefer so to consider it, the discipline, we hear no more of
him. Thus the man only is a soldier, and he subjects himself voluntarily
to the discipline: a man and a woman must be associated in prostitution,
the woman only is subjected to discipline, and that without her own
consent.

3. There are important medical opinions against, as well as in favour
of, the Acts. If the preponderance is in favour, this carries no weight
with me; for professional men look at questions from a professional
point of view, and it being a medical man’s professional duty to
ascertain disease as early as possible and put it under treatment at
once, this professional association is quite sufficient to account for a
medical bias. I suppose medical men would desire to place men also under
the discipline, which would then be decidedly Edition: current; Page:
[1791] less odious, and more effectual. We cannot take their authority
for the half, and then refuse it for the whole. Some of the warmest
medical advocates for the Acts admit that their operation can never be
satisfactory until men also are submitted to them, which, they say, they
know men will never consent to.

4. With regard to those who object to the C. D. A. as encouraging vice,
I do not undertake to defend all they say; but I think them so far in
the right, that even if there were the strongest reasons of other kinds
for the Act, it would always have this for one of its drawbacks. To
soldiers and ignorant persons it cannot but seem that legal precautions
taken expressly to make that kind of indulgence safe, are a license to
it. There is no parallel case of an indulgence or pursuit avowedly
disgraceful and immoral for which the government provides safeguards. A
parallel case would be the supplying of stomach pumps for drunkards, or
arrangements for lending money to gamblers who may otherwise be tempted
into theft in moments of desperation, and thus injure their wives and
families. We have no such parallels by which to prove to men of lax
habits in this particular that we disapprove of, while taking care of
them. It is tolerably plain, therefore, that as a matter of fact the
legislature does regard this with less disfavour than any other practice
generally considered immoral and injurious to society: and the public
evidence of its doing so must of necessity tend to remove feelings of
shame or disapprobation connected with it. I am Dear Sir

Yours very truly

Dear Chadwick

I like most of the Resolutions2 very much (I have made a few verbal
corrections in some of them). The only ones I do not agree with are
Resolutions 8 and 18. I do not think it safe to trust entirely to
voluntary enlistment for the large defensive force which this and every
other country now requires. The perfection of a military system seems to
me to be, to have no standing army whatever (except the amount required
for foreign possessions) but to train the whole of the able bodied male
population to military service. I believe that with previous school
drill, six months training at first, and a few days every succeeding
year, would be amply sufficient for the infantry. This would not take
away the young men from civil occupations to any material extent: the
six months would be taken at the very beginning of active life; and
there would be at once the greatest amount of force possible, and the
strongest security against its being called out unnecessarily: for a
service from which no one would be exempt would inevitably be unpopular,
unless the cause were one for which the nation at large felt a real
enthusiasm. Any military force composed by voluntary enlistment even
under the improved circumstances contemplated by you, would have, in a
greater or less degree, the inconveniences of a standing army: it would
consist principally of the more idle and irregular part of the
population, it would acquire a professional military spirit, and it
would have time to learn habits of passive and active obedience to its
commanders which would make it, if of any considerable magnitude, an apt
instrument of despotism.

Excuse the delay in answering your note.

The only thing I know of which would effect newspaper reform would be to
start a first rate newspaper. The obstacle to this is the difficulty of
obtaining money to set up such a newspaper and carry it on for a
considerable time at a pecuniary loss: and this obstacle seems likely to
be of long continuance.

Short of this I do not see what there is to be done, except for each of
us to do what he can towards improving any of the existing newspapers,
either by writing in it or by such personal influence as he may be able
to exercise.

You are not mistaken in thinking that I shall sympathize with anything
you may do that tends to so desirable an object: but I cannot find time

I rejoice to hear that your short visit to the seaside has somewhat

Edition: current; Page: [1795] will be much retarded if you work up to
the utmost limits of your strength. I hope that you will consider my
proposal2 as still holding good & that you will have recourse to it at
once if you find that your health does not continue to improve.

If I were to write on the attitude which England ought to take in regard
to the war,3 without entering into the subject of the war itself, what I
should have to say would be soon said, for my answer would be, no
attitude at all. It does not seem that there is any urgent necessity for
saying this, as there is at present no danger that England might
interfere in any way. There is not likely to be any party in Parliament
for going to war with Germany in support of France. I greatly regret to
see the political leaders of the working classes led away by the
Comtists4 & by the mere name of a republic into wishing to drag England
into fighting for a government which dreads to face any popular
representation & is forcing the French peasantry by the fear of being
shot, into going up against their will to place themselves under the
fire of the German armies; but there is not the slightest shadow of a
probability that such counsels will be listened to by the government or
by any party in Parliament. The really vital subject of debate will be
the necessity of strengthening ourselves for military purposes & the
subject on which Cairnes is writing5 seems to me to be that which, at
the present moment, it is of real importance to take up energetically.

If, on the other hand, the question to be written about is the war
itself, & its probable or desirable issues, I would rather that this
task shd devolve on any one than on myself. It is only an evident call
of duty that would make me willing to write & publish all I think about
the conduct of the French from first to last & about their claim,
aggressors as they were, & defeated as they are, to dictate the terms of
peace.

Any one who writes on the subject might make good use of a remarkable
pamphlet by Count Agénor de Gasparin6 in which he proposes as the only
right condition of peace the erection of Alsace & German Lorraine into
an independent & neutralized republic. I do not know if the most useful
thing that you could publish at this moment on the subject would not be
a short analysis of this pamphlet with copious translated extracts. I am
afraid the French authorities by their obstinacy have let the time go by
when the German people might have been induced to content themselves
with this amount Edition: current; Page: [1796] of concession. But it is
really though not unattended with difficulties the only settlement that
would be just to all parties; & by bringing it forward the minds of some
readers might perhaps be put upon a right train of thought; & even the
newspaper writers would have an idea suggested to them their advocacy of
which would make the nation less contemptible than they are making it at
present.

If you would like to use M. de Gasparin’s pamphlet for this or any other
purpose, my copy is at your service.

Of course Mrs Fawcett has far better claims to be a member of the
Political Economy Club than many of its present members, and I need
hardly say that I should support her warmly if proposed. I think,
however, that considering how perfectly well every one knows my opinions
on the subject, the proposal would scarcely come with a good grace from
me. It would have in some degree the appearance of wishing to impose my
own opinions upon others. With regard to any one else proposing Mrs
Fawcett, I should say yes, at once, but with one proviso, that there is
a probable chance of her being elected; for as I do not doubt we could
succeed in a few years,2 it would be foolish to court failure now by
undue haste. I think, therefore, that the best course would be for you
to take counsel with Mr Newmarch,3 a hearty friend to women’s suffrage,
and the best judge of the probable leanings of the Club as a whole. If
he thinks it judicious to put Mrs Fawcett’s name among the candidates,
there will not be the smallest difficulty in finding friends to propose
and second her among influential members of the Club less specially
associated with the women’s movement than myself, and therefore in the
particular case more suited for the purpose. I am

B[lackheath] P[ark]

Jan. 19, 1871

My dear Sir

It is always a pleasure & an advantage to hear from you, for your
letters always contain, however briefly, valuable information which the
ordinary sources do not give, respecting the various important movements
Edition: current; Page: [1798] going on in the U.S. It is most
interesting to have news of the struggle which you & others are making
against the characteristic evils of the city of New York & when I hear
that your efforts to extend education among the dangerous classes have
already had a perceptible influence in the amount of juvenile
delinquency as shown by the prison records, I congratulate you most
heartily, for success of that kind goes nearer than any other to the
root of the mischief, & every step made renders further progress easier.
It is also most gratifying to hear that there is an increased feeling
for the reform & purification of the Civil Service. That the cause of
free trade was greatly advancing we already knew; but that is a small
thing compared with the other: besides, a people like the Americans who
really attend to their own public business must find out that what is
called protection is an organised system of pillage of the many by the
few, & the different classes of the pillaged must soon see that the
remedy is to put an end to the pillaging & not to ask to be compensated
by permission to pillage somebody else, with an ultimate result like
placing all Americans in a circle each with his hand in the pocket of
his righthand neighbour. The economic loss & waste of all this is
tremendous, but the resources of your country & the facilities of living
in it are so great that you can bear this waste for a time as no other
country could do. But the corruption of your politicians is a far more
serious matter; it saps the very roots of free government; & the
triumphant success of villainy by corrupting your legislatures & even
the bench of justices, cannot go on without demoralizing the whole
nation. As you truly say, the only remedy is in awakening the public
conscience. The still uncorrupted rural population,—Mr Disraeli’s
“territorial democracy”—who have so often come forward & saved the
country when it seemed on the brink of being led by the professional
politicians into some great folly or iniquity—have to be awakened to the
disgrace & danger of leaving the affairs of the country in the hands of
men who care for them only as a source of corrupt profit. They have only
to refuse their votes to these men & the rule is at an end.

You wish that our writers would discuss the idea of an International
Court of Arbitration. They do discuss it: more has been said & written
on the subject in the last year than ever before. But how little
prepared the European world is for the realization of the idea may be
seen in the fact, that the leaders of our working classes, who have been
more zealous for peace than any other class, & who at the beginning of
this war made a strong demonstration against allowing ourselves to be
drawn into it, are now or at least many of them are loudly demanding
that we shd go to war with Germany in behalf of France. I believe that
the conditions of a settlement of differences by arbitration do exist
between G.B. & the U.S.: because in the first place as I believe, there
really exists in both countries a sincere repugnance to going to
Edition: current; Page: [1799] war with one another; & besides, the
ostensible causes of our disagreements are always the real ones. But how
could the quarrel between France & Germany have been referred to
arbitration? The pretended grievance was a mere sham; the cause of war
was that France could not bear to see Germany made powerful by union. If
such a war could have been prevented it would not have been by a
judicial process but by the forcible interference of neutrals to aid the
party attacked. So with the Crimean war: the real question was not about
any special ground of quarrel: it was, whether Russia shd be allowed to
conquer Turkey or not, which question did not admit of being referred to
arbitration. When the nations of Europe shall have given up national
hatreds & schemes of national aggrandizement, & when their institutions
shall be sufficiently assimilated to prevent any of the governments from
seeing in the greatness & prosperity of another state a danger to its
power over its own people, they will probably be all so sincerely
desirous of peace that they will never dream of any other than an
amicable settlement of any accidental differences that may still arise.
And every step taken in the improvement of the intelligence & morality
of mankind brings this happy result a little nearer.

There is a sort of stagnation just now in our internal politics as the
public can hardly feel interested in anything but the war. The bringing
of the new Education Act into force is however one exception; the
elections of the School Boards for London & other places have excited
great interest: & there will probably be a great extension of
instruction in reading & writing among the children of the poor. How
much more will be taught or how well time must shew; but no real friend
of popular education regards this Education Act as a final measure. The
right of women to a voice in the management of education has been
asserted by the triumphant return of two ladies as members of the London
School Board2 & of several others in different parts of the country.

You ask if we were prepared for the tremendous collapse of the French
military system. Nobody I suppose expected it to be so sudden &
complete, but to those who knew France there was nothing surprising in
it when it came. I hope it will tend to dispel the still common delusion
that despotism is a vigorous government. There never was a greater
mistake. When a government is continually requiring its functionaries to
commit rascalities for its sake, they will go on committing rascalities
for their own: & as there can be no publicity & no effectual system for
the detection of abuse when the government itself has an interest in
concealment, the funds intended for the service of the State find their
way into private pockets & all who want to get rid of onerous public
obligations are able to buy them off. No doubt even Frederick II & the
first Napoleon were often cheated by their officers; but an indolent
Edition: current; Page: [1800] man like the present Napoleon, who
moreover by the circumstances of his usurpation could get few honest men
to serve him, was peculiarly exposed to have the whole of his
administration one mass of profligate malversation. His folly was that
he does not seem to have had any suspicion of this, but rushed into war
in reliance on ground which was completely rotten under his feet.

Dear Madam—

I have had the honour of receiving your letter of 29th December.

Your idea of a general Federation, or United States of Europe, has
occurred to many people, & has been a good deal talked and written about
of late years among advanced philanthropists, especially on the
Continent; indeed, there can be no advanced philanthropist who does not
look forward to something of the kind as the ultimate result of human
improvement. But a great many things have to be got rid of, & a great
many others to be created, before it will begin to be useful to pursue
this federation as a practical object. Such a federal system supposes a
very great degree of mutual trust on the part of the communities which
comprise it, in at least the good intentions of one another. This trust
substantially exists between the States of the American Union (with the
temporary exception of the relations between North and South) but the
States of Europe do not trust one another, & none of them really trusts
its own government much less the governments of the other states. There
is moreover such a want of homogeneity among them, such differences in
their opinions, their institutions, their education, & among some of
them there is still so much mutual antipathy that none of them would
choose to give up so much of its power over its own affairs into the
hands of the others, as your scheme would require. Every improvement
however which takes place either in the internal government or in the
education of any of them, tends to diminish these obstacles & to bring
universal peace, grounded on federal institutions, so much the nearer &
it is to such improvements we must trust for bringing about that & all
the other salutary changes in human affairs which philanthropists look
forward to.

of the endless benefits that will flow from that greatest & most
fundamental of all improvements in human society.

TO THE NEW YORK LIBERAL CLUB1

Jan. 20. 1871

Dear Sir—

I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of Nov. 11,
transmitting the Diploma by which the New York Liberal Club do me the
honour of signifying my election as an Honorary Member of their body.2
What you tell me respecting the origin & purposes of the Liberal Club,
reflects great credit on its founders. There cannot be a higher or more
important aim than that of asserting & maintaining individuality of
thought & character, Edition: current; Page: [1802] together with its
necessary complement, the fullest latitude of mutual criticism. Such
Associations are a means of making head against the greatest danger of a
settled state of society, the danger of intellectual stagnation; & help
towards raising up men qualified to speak to the public with decisive
effect on those political & social questions which are continually
presenting fresh demands on the collective thought & intellectual
discernment of the nation.

You intimate that it might be acceptable if in acknowledging your
communication, I were to take the opportunity of expressing my opinion
on the desirableness of a Free Trade policy for America. I cannot
suppose that those who have thought me deserving of the distinguished
honour conferred on me, can have anything to learn respecting my opinion
on a question of this nature. But I shd not be doing justice to my sense
of that honour or to the interest I feel in the objects & in the
prosperity of the Club, were I not to comply with the wish expressed by
you in its behalf.

I hold every form of what is called Protection to be an employment of
the powers of Government to tax the Many with the intention of promoting
the pecuniary gains of a Few: I say the intention, because even that
desired object is very often not attained, & never to the extent that is
expected. But whatever gain there is, is made by the Few, & them alone;
for the labouring people employed in the protected branches of industry
are not benefitted. Wages do not range higher in the protected than in
other employments; they depend on the general rate of the remuneration
of labour in the country, & if the demand for particular kinds of labour
is artificially increased, the consequence is merely that labour is
attracted from other occupations, so that employment is given in the
protected trades to a greater number, but not at a higher remuneration.
The gain by Protection when there is gain, is for the employers alone.
Such legislation was worthy of Great Britain under her unreformed
constitution, when the powers of legislation were in the hands of a
limited class of great landowners & wealthy manufacturers. But in a
democratic nation like the U.S. it is a signal instance of dupery, & I
have a higher opinion of the intelligence of the American Many than to
believe that a handful of manufacturers will be able to retain by
fallacy & sophistry that power of levying a toll on every other person’s
earnings, which the powerful aristocracy of England with all their
political ascendancy & social prestige have not been able to keep
possession of.

The misapprehension, & confusion of thought which exist on this
subject—misapprehension & confusion quite genuine, I allow, in the
Protectionist mind—arise from a very small number of oversights, natural
enough perhaps in those who have never thought on the subject.

1. When people see manufactories built & hands set to work to produce at
home what had previously been imported from abroad, they imagine that
all Edition: current; Page: [1803] this is fresh industry & fresh
employment, over & above that which existed before, & that whatever
increased production takes place in these particular trades is so much
additional wealth created in the country. The oversight is in not
considering that this additional labour & capital to which this
production is due, are not created, but withdrawn from other employments
in which they would have added as much to the wealth of the country, &
not only as much, but more, since they would not have needed a subsidy
out of every consumer’s pocket to make their employment remunerative.
That the apparent increase of employment produced by Protection is a
mere transfer from one business to another, is true everywhere but is
particularly obvious in America since no one will pretend that labour &
capital in the U.S. are in any danger of not finding employment, or that
the time is at hand when they will even be obliged to submit to any
diminution of wages or of profits.

2. There is a widely diffused notion that by means of protecting duties
on foreign commodities, a nation taxes not itself, but the foreign
producers. Because foreign nations can really be made to suffer, by
being deprived of a beneficial trade, it is imagined that what the
foreigners lose one’s own country must gain. But this is a complete
misunderstanding of the nature & operation of Protection. Duties on such
foreign commodities as do not come into competition with home
productions, sometimes do fall partly on foreigners, unless the effect
is frustrated by a similar policy in the foreign country. Such duties do
not destroy any wealth, & may alter its distribution. But such is not
the case with any duties so far as they have a protective operation. For
their protective operation consists in causing something to be made in
one place which in a state of freedom would be made in another, &
whatever does this diminishes the total produce of the world’s labour;
for in a state of freedom, everything naturally tends to be produced in
the places & in the ways by which the cost incurred in labour & capital
obtains the largest return. If this working of the ordinary motives to
production is interfered with, & producers are bribed, at other people’s
expense, to produce an article where they would not otherwise find it
for their interest to do so, there is a loss to the world of a portion
of its annual produce, which would have been shared in some proportion
or other between the importing & the exporting countries. America can in
this way damage foreigners but she cannot tax them, for she cannot avoid
largely sharing their loss.

3. A notion very powerful in the minds of some Americans, is that if
they let in the competition of what they call the pauper labour of
Europe they would reduce their own labourers to similar pauperism. Let
me observe by the way that the labour which produces the exportable
articles of Europe & especially of England, is not pauper labour, but is
generally the most highly paid manual labour of the country. But it is
of course true that the general wages of labour in America are above the
English level, & if these high wages Edition: current; Page: [1804] were
the effect of Protection, I for one shd never wish to see Protection
abolished. But it is not because of Protection that wages in America are
high, it is because there is abundance of land for every labourer &
because every labourer is at liberty to acquire it. As long as this
abundance of land relatively to population continues, wages will not
decline. These high wages are not a special burthen upon the New England
cotton spinner or the Pennsylvanian iron master; but have equally to be
paid in agriculture & in those numerous branches of manufacturing &
other industries (the building trades for example) which every country
necessarily carries on for itself. If those employments, which form the
bulk of the industry of the country, can pay the high American wages &
yield besides, the high American profits, & if there are other branches
of manufacture which cannot do this unless the people of the U.S.
consent to pay them a subsidy in the form of a large extra price, the
former class of employments yield a greater return to the labour &
capital of America than the latter, & it is for the interest of American
production on the whole that the labour & capital of the country shd be
diverted from the employments which require to be subsidized, to those
which can maintain themselves without.

4. An argument in favour of protection which carries weight with many
Americans who are not deceived by the economic fallacies of
Protectionism, is that it is an evil to have the population of a country
too exclusively agricultural & that the interests of civilisation
require a considerable admixture of large towns. I acknowledge that
there was no little force in this argument, at a much earlier period of
American development. But the time has surely gone by when the growth of
towns in the U.S. required any artificial encouragement. Even in those
parts of the Union in which little or no protected industry is carried
on, towns spring into existence & into greatness with a rapidity more
marvellous than even the extension of the cultivated area of your
territory. The necessity of centres both for internal & foreign trade;
the multitude of occupations which from the nature of things are not
exposed to the competition of distant places; & the many kinds &
qualities of manufacture which are kept at home by the natural
protection of cost of carriage, ensure to the U.S. a town population
amply sufficient for a country in which to be an agricultural labourer
does not mean as it has hitherto meant in England to be an uneducated
barbarian. I believe the most enlightened Americans are generally of
opinion that at present it is the rural much more than the town
population which is both the physical & the moral strength of the
country.

To these various considerations I might add that the protection lavished
upon some favoured classes of producers is even from the Protectionist
point of view a serious injury to other producers who depend on those
for the materials or the instruments of their several businesses; & that
the attempt to remedy this injustice by distributing protection all
round exhibits American Edition: current; Page: [1805] producers in the
ludicrous light of attempting to get rich by mutually taxing one
another. But these points have been placed in so strong a light by Mr
Wells’ justly celebrated Report3 that it is quite superfluous for me to
insist on them. Rather would I endeavour to impress my conviction that
the evils of Protection though they may be aggravated by the details of
its application, cannot be removed by any readjustment of those details;
& that any Protection whatever, just in so far as it is Protection—just
in so far as it fulfils its purpose—abstracts in a greater or a less
degree from the aggregate wealth of mankind, & leaves a less amount of
product to be shared among the nations of the earth, to the necessary
loss of all nations whose industry is forced out of its spontaneous
course, by preventing them either from importing or from exporting any
article which they would import or export in a state of freedom.

Dear Mr Leslie—

I did not write to you on receiving your letter of the 22nd because from
what you said I counted upon seeing you at the P[olitical] Ec[onomy]
Club;2 I hope your absence was not caused by any retrogression in your
health, the account of which in your letter was so favourable.

I am extremely glad that you are going to speak at the Women’s Suffrage
meeting.3 It is settled that Sir R. Anstruther4 is to take the chair.

I will endeavour to refresh my memory of your article in Dec. 18675 &
will mention it as opportunities offer. It does you great honour to have
taken up the Swiss system6 so early as the example to be followed in
reforming our own. Many thoughtful people are now coming round to the
Swiss system (of Edition: current; Page: [1806] which Chadwick’s school
drill7 forms a part) but the majority even of army reformers are still
far behind. They are prejudiced against making military service within
the country compulsory on the whole male population chiefly because for
want of knowledge of facts they have a most exaggerated idea of the time
which would have to be sacrificed from the ordinary pursuits of life. It
is to be hoped there will at least be some few persons in Parlt who will
resist the attempt likely to be made by the Govt to satisfy the demand
for an increased military force without making any fundamental change in
the old system. It will be an uphill fight to get a really national
defensive force, but it may be a question of life & death to this
country not only to have it, but to have it soon. I do not know which
are most smitten with imbecility, those who are for trusting our safety
solely to our navy on the speculation that no foreign army can land in
England or those who after crying at the top of their voices that we are
utterly without the means of facing an enemy in the field turn around
next day & demand that we shd instantly go to war with Russia for the
Black Sea or with Germany for France.

B[lackheath] P[ark]

Feb. 16. 1871

Dear Mr Villari—

It was a real pleasure to hear from you again. It is, as you say a long
time since any letters have passed between us, & the momentous and most
unexpected events which have succeeded one another so Edition: current;
Page: [1807] rapidly during the time make it seem even longer than it
is. Among all these events there is but one which we can regard with
unqualified satisfaction. The acquisition of Rome by Italy2 is now an
accomplished fact, & I hope it will be an example how great the power of
an accomplished fact is. But Italy will have to look to her strength. If
either the Legitimist or the Orleanist party gets the upper hand in the
struggle for power which will now take place in France, they will
certainly ally themselves with the clergy. How hostile both those
parties have always been to the cause of Italy we know; & when the
French begin to aim at recovering their military reputation & some part
of their influence in Europe, they are much more likely to make their
first trial of strength with Italy (& indeed with any of the neutrals)
than with Germany. This is one of the most serious dangers impending
over Europe, though apparently one of the least thought of, at least in
England.

With regard to the present war, there now seems to be good hope that the
National Assembly will put an end to it.3 The time for the neutral
powers to have interfered was before hostilities had begun. I did not
see this at the time, but have been converted to it since. I now believe
that there would not have been any war, if even England alone had
declared that it would send its fleet to act against whichever side
began the attack. But there has been no time since at which neutrals
could have interfered to any good purpose. Armed interference was out of
the question, for not having opposed the French aggression, they could
not go to war to shield France from the penalties of failure: & for
mediation there was no room so long as the French Government insisted
that France alone of all nations may gain territory by successful war
but must not lose territory by the most thorough & most just defeat.
Even now, when that pretension will probably be abandoned, things have
gone too far & the public opinion of Germany as to the only safe terms
of peace has become too decided, to make it conceivable that the
counsels or opinion of neutrals will be at all listened to by the German
Government.

I regret for the sake of Italy that you no longer occupy your position
in the Ministry of Public Instruction,4 though I hope for a large
compensation in the use you are making of your leisure to write a book
on Machiavelli.5 You were of course quite right to resign rather than be
the instrument of a policy you do not approve. Doubtless, a rigid
economy in expenditure is at present indispensable to Italy; but
education is the last of the public interests which should be the
subject of any other economy than that which consists in making every
lira spent go the farthest possible towards the attainment of the end.
Unfortunately the economy of most governments consists in starving
Edition: current; Page: [1808] useful service & spending the money of
the public in political or private jobbing; & I suppose Italy has its
share of those costs like other countries.

Do not trouble yourself to send the many large folio volumes you
mention. The occasion which made me write to have those on emigration
has now passed by.6

21st March 1871

Dear Sir,—

I have understood that the expediency of making the contract between a
trades union and its members legally binding and enforceable by the
tribunals, has been much discussed among trade unionists, and that the
prevailing opinion among them is adverse to giving force of law to the
engagement. I believe that one objection felt by the trade unionists to
the establishment of a legal obligation, is that it would necessarily
lead to the decision of the ordinary courts of law of the expediency of
particular strikes, whenever funds have been prevented by such strikes
from being forthcoming to meet the other liabilities of the unions. This
appears to open up the question of how far it is well that the same
organisation should provide for the trade interests as well as for the
private interests of its members: and this is a question Edition:
current; Page: [1810] on which I am not at present prepared to give a
decided opinion; for while, at first sight, the reasons against this
combination appear extremely powerful, I am aware that there are others
of very great weight in its favour. One of these reasons is that the
fact that a trade union has other and pressing demands for its funds is
likely to induce great caution, if not reluctance, to entering upon a
strike; and the combination therefore is thought by many to have a
tendency to diminish the number of strikes that will be undertaken by
the unions.

Dear Mrs Fawcett

There is not at present any question of having a paid Secretary to the
Land Tenure Reform Association, because the attempt to do so must land
the Association in bankruptcy, inasmuch as our whole assets would not
pay a Secretary with the needful printing and stationery for one year,
and on this account it is that a new Secretary has to be found. Some of
our members are anxious that the Secretary should be paid, thinking that
the work may be better attended to in that case, but I do not find that
anyone is forthcoming to state how the money is to be got with which to
pay one; and I need not say that I shall never consent to launch into
expenses in the hope that they may bring in future subscriptions. I
shall decline to be President or Chairman if any expenses are undertaken
for which we have not a clear prospect of funds.

If, however, subscriptions should come in, I should be glad to know
whether Miss Rhoda Garrett2 would think as little as £50 a year
sufficient for her services. The late Secretary asks £100, and of course
it may be possible that we may have sufficient subscriptions for the
half, though not for the whole; and it might form an element in our
decision, if we know what would be Miss R. Garrett’s terms.

Dear Sir

It is very difficult to recommend books on politics for such students as
those who are the subject of your letter. Not only, as you truly say,
there are no manuals of statesmanship, but, though there are many books
which treat particular topics instructively or which for one reason or
another are worth reading, I can mention very few which, judged by the
best lights of the present time, do not contain at least as many errors
as truths; in addition to which, they are written with reference to
European questions and difficulties, and presuppose a knowledge of
ordinary European facts and opinions such as it is not likely that your
Japanese friends have yet acquired. There are few writers better worth
studying to an European thinker than Adam Smith, Montesquieu,
Tocqueville; but I doubt their being of much use for this particular
purpose. On the whole I can think of no books so likely to be useful,
both from their intrinsic merit and from their cosmopolitan character as
some of Bentham’s writings, especially those edited in French by Dumont,
translations of which, or the original papers on which they were
founded, are in the collected edition of Bentham’s Works.2 To these I
may add some of my father’s articles in the Supplement to the
Encyclopedia Britannica, especially “Jurisprudence,” “Education,” and
“Law of Nations.”

To enable an active minded Asiatic to understand and profit by European
political thought, nothing seems to me more important than that he
should acquaint himself with European history; beginning with the
standard books, notwithstanding their imperfections, and enriching them
by the best critical or philosophical writings on historical subjects.
Here, also, the choice of Edition: current; Page: [1813] books presents
great difficulties; but the general outline of the facts of history has
to be first acquired, with as little admixture of false notions as
possible.

I am much obliged to you for your book,2 which I had already read in the

I expected. I am writing something on it for the Fortnightly,3 but with
little confidence of success, for it is hardly possible to do justice to
any of your writings by a summary. I share your fears as to the tendency
of things in India. It is remarkable that a reaction in favour of the
English ideas of landed property should have taken place in India at the
very time when in England itself a movement has been beginning towards
the wider and more literal conception which has prevailed for two
generations in India. Nothing, however, is so likely to check this
reaction as your book, which may be expected to be read not only by the
young civil officers of the Indian Government, but, we may hope, by
those who are preparing for the competitive examination.

Unhappily, it is difficult to interest English readers of periodicals in
an Indian subject, but that part of your book which relates to Europe
and England will have great and increasing interest; and by the aid of
that, the more intelligent readers may be led to pay attention to the
Indian part.

far as his opinions agree with my own, I think the Essays show a very
considerable mastery of the subject: but I was perhaps still more
impressed by one of them which maintains opinions opposed to my own, &
which shows an originality & vigour of thought entitling it to a high
place among the writings on its own side of the question.

Dear Mr Robertson

I have seen Mr Hare, who would like to see you on Tuesday at 12, if you
can make it convenient to call on him at No 8 York Street St James’s
Square.

It appears to me that if you are outvoted on the motion that the
Committee refuses to send delegates, it would be advisable to take a
fresh ground, viz. that a measure which would swamp the London Committee
in a Central Committee of provincials2 in which it would have but three
representatives cannot be adopted except by a vote of the London
Society, which the London Committee represents. This seems to me both
rational in itself, and technically correct, and if your motion is
negatived, we think another should be made, referring the question to a
general meeting of the London Society, to be called for the purpose.
This would embarrass the enemy very much as their object is, quietly to
supersede the London Committee, and not to raise a public discussion.
The best person to bring forward this motion would be Mr Hare, or in his
default, Mr Hunter.3 This practically also would gain time (and the
object of the enemy is to decide all as swiftly as possible, in order
that they may get into action this session in London): and we think it
would probably detach Mrs Taylor’s4 vote at least from the enemy, as she
would be likely to be moved by the argument that the London Executive
Committee has no right to decide a point practically swamping the London
Society, without referring to the members of that Society itself. I am

Dear Mr Robertson

We think that it would be a very good plan to send round as you propose,
to the other Committees a statement of reasons, and that there is no
harm, but rather good, in any steps that make widely known a distinct
difference of opinion between the London Committee and the Manchester;2
short always of its being so done as to be likely to get into the
newspapers. Perhaps to avoid this, the word “Private” should be written
or printed at the head of whatever paper is sent round.

We think also that it would be better for all to vote simply against any
new member of the London Committee of whom you cannot feel quite sure in
future divisions: and no reasons need be given, but if any is wanted I
think it amply sufficient to plead the superior efficiency of a small
Committee over a large one. I am Dear Mr Robertson

Mon cher d’Eichthal

Vous ne m’avez pas donné le numéro de votre nouvelle adresse, cependant
j’espère que ceci vous parviendra, comme aussi un exemplaire du
Programme de l’Association2 que j’ai mis à la poste pour vous. Je suis
charmé que vous ayez assisté au meeting et qu’il vous ait intéressé.

Il est très vrai que le défaut d’instruction générale, et surtout de
connaissances Edition: current; Page: [1821] historiques, condamne la
plupart des ouvriers qui sont des hommes politiques à une certaine
étroitesse de vues, même lorsque leurs idées sont foncièrement bonnes.
Il n’y aura de remède à cela que graduellement, par le progrès de
l’enseignement populaire. J’ai reçu de M. Odger une lettre où il me
remercie de lui avoir fait faire votre connaissance,3 et de lui avoir
procuré une conversation très intéressante avec vous.

Je partage tout à fait votre avis sur les baux à long terme que l’état
devrait donner lorsque des terres à sa disposition sont demandées pour
quelque entreprise utile; et je crois que ce système suffirait pour
donner une juste récompense à la prévoyance dans cette sorte d’affaires.

Mais outre les accroissements de valeur locaux et incertains qui
dépendent du succès d’une spéculation, il y a un accroissement général
qui ne dépend que de la prospérité croissante du pays; et c’est celui-là
que l’Association revendique le droit d’intercepter au profit de la
nation.

J’ai vu M. Wolowski.4 Comme il est acharné contre tous ceux qui prennent
part au mouvement de Paris. C’est la mesure de l’exaspération, naturelle
peutêtre, mais très regrettable, que cette malheureuse guerre civile a
déjà engendré.5

Dear Mr Robertson

1. I think it a very fortunate circumstance that Miss Biggs2 is willing
to resign the Secretaryship, and her resignation should be at once
gladly accepted, lest she should change her mind. It appears to me out
of the question for Miss Biggs to remain, unless as entirely subordinate
to another, and far better that she should not remain at all. Nor need
there be, in my opinion, any apprehension of difficulty in replacing
her. The experience required is very much less than is supposed, and it
would be far better that the London Society should consist wholly of
persons on whom you can thoroughly rely, even though the work had to be
relaxed or set aside for a time. The mere existence of a responsible and
discreet body under the name of the London Society, is of far greater
importance than any work it can do.

2. It would be well also that Mr Biggs3 should resign the Treasurership,
which I understand you to think is likely if his daughter should resign
the Secretaryship.

3. I understand from Mr Bain that the Committee might probably meet at
Miss Orme’s home, and I think this would be most desirable, as I think
Miss Orme4 should be the new Secretary. I think the Treasurer should be
either yourself, or Mrs Westlake,5 or Mr Hare, or Mrs Burbury.6 In all
probability Edition: current; Page: [1824] Mrs Westlake, if asked to
accept the Treasurership, would do so on knowing that Mrs Taylor
retires, and very likely Mrs Westlake would lend her house for meetings.
She lives at 16 Oxford Square. I think, however, that you yourself would
be the best Treasurer, as you would be able to assist Miss Orme with
your advice. I repeat that you need have no fear of Miss Orme’s not
being able to do the work. She would very quickly learn all that is
really necessary, and we may hope would be free from that feverish
bustle which has made what work has been done seem twice as laborious as
it really need be. I know that Miss Biggs has been very far from
judicious, and has either lent herself to, or has herself been the cause
of, most unwise mingling, this year, of the franchise with the C.D.A.
agitation: besides that, in her unnecessary eagerness to get up
particular meetings a week or two earlier rather than later, she
declares “money to be no object.” This sort of feverish haste on the
part of the Secretary and Treasurer creates obstacles of every kind.

4. If there should be difficulty in obtaining either Miss Orme’s or Mrs
Westlake’s assistance in regard to a place of meeting, or if their homes
are not thought convenient, I think the room you mention, of the Century
Club, might be made use of, and that there would be no objection on the
part of ladies to go to it.

5. It appears to me that any offers, in the way of resignation, on the
part of any of the members on whose votes you cannot habitually count,
should be accepted at once without any hesitation. The success of your
efforts in guiding the Committee so as to be of public utility depends
upon having a working majority, next to your having the Secretary and
Treasurer thoroughly to be relied upon.

6. I need scarcely say, the insidious proposal to send delegates to the
London Committee, should in my opinion be opposed as strongly as the
other, that the London Committee should send delegates to them. It is
only another form of the same thing—an effort to make use for rash
folly, of the authority acquired by the prudence and good taste of the
London Committee. To all such proposals it should be steadily answered,
that the Manchester or any other Committee can do whatever it pleases by
itself, and that the London Committee is not disposed to lend its name
or its influence to any measures whatever that it does not decide upon
entirely by itself. The London Committee does not desire to interfere
with any of the others, and cannot consent to be interfered with by
them.

7. I am so very strongly of opinion that the Committee should not seem
to be merely my mouthpiece, that I feel that for the sake of the cause
it is best I should not accept the office of President. If you can get
rid of dangerous members of the Committee, or outnumber them by steady
attendants, it will be easy by degrees to add new members who will be
useful and creditable. Just now the task to be done is to secure the
guidance of the Committee by Edition: current; Page: [1825] good hands
in the present crisis. If that is successfully achieved, confidence will
grow up again, and a strong Committee may be formed in time. I am

of having published. Mr B. is a careful & conscientious historical
student & may be known to you as the author of a History of the
Commonwealth of England,3 this three years ago by Murray, & which by the
original researches it is founded on, and the light it throws on an
interesting period well merits the attention of the historians & of the
public. I differ from many of the opinions expressed in these Essays,
but the author is well entitled to speak on the historical questions to
which they principally refer, for he has given very serious study to the
evidence.

I have just received your letter and the Spectator, dear, for which many
thanks—especially for the letter, which like all your letters does me
good. We came here yesterday from Dunkeld; the coach does not yet run,
but the Edition: current; Page: [1827] coach proprietors sent us by
posting at a low rate. The day was fine, and I thought we were to have
at least one day without rain; but the rain came in the twilight, and
there has been rain today, though not enough to impede our walking and
botanising. The plants have been a little disappointing: even on Ben
Lawers2 Irvine did not find so many as I expected. I am in better
spirits, dear, partly from your kind letter, partly from the cheering
influence of our first fine day, but most because the sleepiness has not
been so excessive; yesterday and today it has been perhaps not more than
with me it usually is in travelling. I have nothing to trouble me now
but the great and rapid increase of my other symptoms. I have no sign
now of indigestion, except (and that is a great exception) a frequent
bitter taste in my mouth and a dry tongue in the night. I saw a mention
of the pussical show in a newspaper: I think if we were to send Phidia
she ought to gain one of the prizes. By the passage from the Times about
the Stelvio, Engadine &c.3 I suppose that the bad weather is general in
Northern and Central Europe. Here, by which I mean in Scotland, people
are telling one another what fine weather their letters say there is in
the South. One wonders that such silly things should be written by
people who must know better. We do not care to post back by the way we
came, and think it best to go to Ballater tomorrow (Friday) and thence
by the train to Aberdeen the only way of getting from here by railway.
In this way we should probably (unless we stay to botanize somewhere on
the way) arrive at Edinburgh on Saturday night; so that anything
directed to Edinburgh by even Saturday’s post will reach us there. I
think my nervous system must be much out of order, for I cannot even use
my pen properly; the handwriting of all my letters to you seems to me
that of a sick person.

Dear Mr Cairnes

We arrived here on the 17th, after a most successful journey: the
weather was generally excellent, and our enjoyment greater than on any
of our former visits to Switzerland, owing to Helen’s excellent idea of
stopping at the unfrequented Edition: current; Page: [1828] places, and
avoiding those which are crowded with tourists. We stopped neither at
Geneva, Lausanne, nor Bern, and used Lucerne chiefly as a place to go
out from. We went there by short railway journies putting up at some of
the most charming little towns we ever saw—Nyon, Romont, and especially
Burgdorf. At Lucerne we took a rowing boat and made a six days tour of
the Lake, part of which we spent on Mount Pilatus, where we staid two
nights at one of the hotels on the top, and saw the mountain, and
whatever is to be seen from it, to perfection. You would have been
surprised to see how, after walking the whole way up the mountain, we
had no sooner dined than Helen was ready and eager for two hours more
walking among the summits. You may judge from this how rapidly the
change told upon her strength, and it was equally beneficial to mine. We
returned from Lucerne by the new post road up the valley of Sarnen and
over the Brünig to Brienz, then through Interlaken to Thun, and thence
by the Simmenthal the valley of the Chateau d’Oex, and a still newer
road down the magnificent Val d’Ormont, one of the finest gorges in the
Alps, to Aigle in the valley of the Rhone. From Aigle we came here by
railway, stopping only at Nyon and Lyons. To our surprise and pleasure
we found the weather here by no means overhot; the thermometer did not
exceed 76° on Saturday, and 78° yesterday. We are both of us much better
for the journey, though Helen has had two bad returns of her headache,
first at Lucerne and then here. But we have got back into the full home
feeling here, and have thorough enjoyment of the beauty, which is in its
greatest perfection, and gains rather than loses from our recent
experience of the Alps. In fact, our irrigated meadows give the full
freshness and greenness of Switzerland, the Ventoux gives the
perceptions and feelings of mountain scenery, and all the effects of our
glorious skies and lights come in addition; which we always find more
splendid in presence than we are able to realize in absence. I hope both
for Helen and myself much improvement in health, and for myself some
good work this autumn and winter. The first thing I have to write is an
article for Morley on the new edition of Berkeley.2 It is a happiness in
these days to get back to metaphysics from politics. The whole state of
Europe inspires sadness enough, but that of England contempt. We are
now, it seems, avowedly incapable of moving even a small army; our ships
are lost,3 one after another; and our ministers, instead of being turned
out with disgrace, will apparently live out the duration of a seven
years Parliament, even now, when they have put the finishing stroke to
their meanness Edition: current; Page: [1829] by proposing a pecuniary
compensation to Governor Eyre;4 a thing which in my worst apprehensions
of what a Gladstone Ministry could come to, I had never expected. After
this I shall henceforth wish for a Tory Government.

Dear Sir—

From accidental circumstances your very interesting letter of 18th May
1870 has only just reached me.

Your answer to Judge Richmond2 is excellent & takes up what I consider
the right attitude towards the class of questions to which it relates. I
am much obliged to you for sending it. In regard to your question,
whether an unverified hypothesis can rationally serve as a basis for
expectation & action,3 I quite agree with you that it may do so to a
certain extent. On subjects on which we cannot hope for knowledge, we
may fairly choose among the various hypotheses which are neither
self-contradictory nor contradicted by experience, the one which is most
beneficial to our moral nature; provided we always remember that its
truth is a matter of possibility & of hope, not of belief. Now the
cultivation of the idea of a perfectly good & wise being & of the desire
to help the purposes of such a being is morally beneficial in the
highest degree though the belief that this being is omnipotent &
therefore the creator of physical & moral evil is as demoralizing a
belief as can be entertained. Both the copies of your lecture I fear
have miscarried but I am very Edition: current; Page: [1830] happy to
hear of its delivery & to know that you take a view similar to my own of

Dear Sir—

I have just received your letter of July 11. I cannot imagine how the
passage quoted from my Princ. of Pol. Econ. can be supposed to give any
support to the imposition of Town Duties.2 It is true I object to
“calling upon one tax to defray the whole or the chief part of the
public expenditure”: but the local expenses of the town of Bombay are a
very small part of the share of public expenditure falling upon its
inhabitants. A house tax appears to me one of the most equitable of all
taxes not only in so far as it falls on the occupier but also (in a
thriving town) as far as it falls on the ground landlord, from whom it
merely intercepts part of the unearned increase of income which he
derives from the general prosperity of the place. An octroi, on the
contrary, to be productive, must be levied on the necessaries of life or
at least on articles generally used by the mass of the people & is
therefore one of the most unequal & most burthensome of all ways of
raising a revenue. I do not say that in a country like India where it is
difficult to levy any tax to which the people are not used, financial
necessity may not sometimes justify having recourse to such a tax, but I
am sure it shd only be adopted in extremity.

Monsieur—

Je vous remercie sincèrement du don de la nouvelle livraison de votre
Manuel du Droit Civil.2 Je m’en promets beaucoup de plaisir lorsque
j’aurai le temps de l’examiner particulièrement. En attendant je suis
très content de posséder, dans un volume peu étendu, ce qu’il faut pour
connaître et pour comprendre le droit français actuel en matière de
mariage, présenté par un penseur qui ne cherche pas à en déguiser les
injustices.

Votre lettre, publié dans le “Levant Times”3 n’a rien d’opposé à mes
opinions, sauf peutêtre quelques minuties de phraséologie. Du reste, les
limites nécessairement étroites de la lettre ont dû restreindre le
développement de votre pensée, qui se trouve plus pleinement exposée
dans votre brochure “La République et la Contre Révolution.”4 Dans cette
brochure il y a beaucoup de choses qui s’accordent avec mes plus fermes
convictions, et quelques-unes qui indiquent des différences dans notre
manière de voir. D’abord quant à la partie historique je suis
entièrement de votre avis. Depuis ma jeunesse je n’ai qu’une même
opinion là dessus: en 1827 (alors même j’avais beaucoup étudié la
Révolution française) j’ai publié un article dans la revue de
Westminster5 où j’ai soutenu par des preuves irrécusables précisément
votre thèse, savoir que l’attaque a toujours été du côté de la Contre
Révolution et que la Révolution n’a fait que se défendre. Quant à la
partie philosophique, vous savez probablement par mon Essai sur la
Liberté, dans quel sens et avec quelles limites j’entends notre principe
commun, celui de Edition: current; Page: [1832] l’autonomie de
l’individu. Je reconnais cette autonomie comme une règle rigoureuse dans
les choses qui ne regardent que l’individu lui même ou, si elles
intéressent les autres, ne les intéressent que par l’influence de
l’exemple ou par l’intérêt indirect que d’autres peuvent avoir au
bonheur et à la prospérité de chacun. Par cette doctrine j’affranchis de
tout contrôle hors celui de la critique le cercle de la vie individuelle
proprement dite. Mais dans ceux de nos actes qui touchent directement
aux intérêts d’autrui, il faut à mon sens une autre règle, celle de
l’intérêt général. Par exemple je ne trouve pas comme vous que
l’autonomie de la personne humaine exige que toutes les fonctions
publiques soient électives. S’il y a (comme il y a assurément) des
fonctions importantes (celle de juge par exemple) qui exigent des
qualités ou des connaissances de qui ne peuvent être bien jugées que par
des experts, je trouve que les citoyens peuvent sans compromettre leur
autonomie individuelle confier à un ministre responsable la tâche de
chercher et de trouver les hommes les plus compétents pour cette
fonction. Pour parler plus généralement, je n’admets pas qu’une
organisation politique quelconque soit de droit absolu. Je crois au
contraire que des états de civilisation différents exigent souvent des
institutions politiques différentes. Et même en admettant que lorsque
l’heure de la république est venue la majorité n’a pas le droit
d’imposer à toute la nation le gouvernement monarchique, j’y ajouterais
qu’une minorité républicaine aurait encore moins le droit d’imposer la
république à la majorité contre son gré; et que cette tentative ne peut
aboutir qu’à une tyrannie, parcequ’elle ne peut réussir qu’en refusant à
la plus grande partie du peuple les mêmes droits politiques qu’à la
partie qui se tient pour plus éclairée, et en réprimant par la violence
tout effort qu’elle peut faire pour revendiquer l’égalité de droits.

Malgré ces différences d’opinion je me réjouis grandement de votre
puissante protestation au nom des droits de l’individu contre la
prétendue souveraineté des majorités, idole auquel les démocrates
français ont si souvent immolé au moins en théorie, les principes les
plus essentiels de la politique.

Dear Mr Cairnes

Many thanks for your letter, and for the kind and friendly interest you
feel in all that concerns us. We have now been here for more than a
month, to our great advantage, for no place agrees so thoroughly with
both of us as this does. We have had no oppressive heat, and enjoy the
place very much. Helen, Edition: current; Page: [1833] I am sorry to
say, is still very weak. As for my own health, it is quite satisfactory.

It is always pleasant to discuss questions of logic and method with you,
as your difficulties, no less than your convictions, always lie in the
deeper regions of the subject. The kind of laws of coexistence which you
speak of,2 are recognised and discussed in my Logic,3 but are treated as
empirical laws, which, if thoroughly understood, would be found to
depend on laws of succession; for, as the coexistent phenomena all
depend on causes, no doubt the ground of their coexistence would be
found in the causes if we knew them. Of such uniformities of coexistence
there is a great multitude in Nature; and the general remark in my Logic
to which you refer goes only to this, that there is no universal axiom
of coexistence, to the effect that every phenomenon must have an
invariable coexistent, as there is that every phenomenon must have an
invariable antecedent. I will look again at what I have written on the
subject but cannot do so at present, not having a copy of my Logic here.

I have been writing for Morley since I have been here, an article on the
new edition of Berkeley’s works;4 a subject very interesting to me, as I
look upon Berkeley, notwithstanding some mistakes, as one of our
greatest names in philosophy. It was a great relief to get back to such
a subject out of present politics; but the relief is only temporary for
the minds of all classes are so ill prepared for the social questions

Dear Mr Robertson

1. I think the suggestion “that the London Committee will consent to
discuss the basis of a central organization of which it shall be a
constituent, after the repeal of the C[ontagious] D[iseases] Acts,”2 is
a very good one; and that if the London Committee and those of us who
approve of it are forced to an open breach with the other school of
agitators,3 the question of the association of the agitation for the
repeal of the C.D.A. with that for the suffrage would be a good ground
upon which to allow the breach to take place.

2. It is important that no further concession than that contained in
this suggestion should be made: and I am of opinion that too much stress
ought not to be laid on the fear of coming to a public breach. I may as
well say that for my own part, I am by no means determined to avoid at
all costs the public expression of my disapprobation of the course
pursued by some of the advocates of Women’s Suffrage: and that I look
forward to the possibility of being obliged by their injudicious conduct
to make some such declaration. A breach of this sort has become
absolutely necessary in America, and may become necessary here: and it
is important that the advocates of moderation Edition: current; Page:
[1835] should not be terrified into being used as mere instruments in
the hands of the violent party, by the threat of open quarrel, inasmuch
as when all has been got out of them that is wanted of them, the violent
party by its very nature will have no scruple in being the first to make
the very quarrel, for the avoidance of which the others have made great
sacrifices. It will be more farsighted and judicious for the moderate
party to choose its own ground for a stand, and to make that stand
before it has sacrificed anything of real importance; especially as in
this way it is more likely to act as a real check to the violent. I am

Dear Mr Robertson

I approve much of Mr Hunter’s2 suggestion as regards the C.D.A.
agitation, but you will observe I have qualified the words in some
respects. I have altered “will consent to discuss and settle” into “will
consent to discuss”; and “after the agitation about the C.D. Acts is
closed” into “after the repeal of the C.D. Acts:”3 and I think the
wording should be carefully attended to, and that Mr Hunter should be on
his guard against assenting to anything more. The C.D. Acts are an
important part of our objection, and a capital battle ground; but we
must not lose sight, in our own minds, of the fact, that the C.D.A.
agitation itself would never have become the objectionable thing many
people feel it, had it been carried on by people who had more knowledge
of the world, and more consideration for the feelings of others. These
same people would soon contrive to make the agitation for the suffrage
vulgar and ridiculous: and if you consent to any negociations with them,
it can, I think, only be that by the selection of only the best among
them, and retaining a substantial majority in your own hands, you may
hope to act as a check upon their indiscretions; not because you really
hope that when the C.D.A.—the subject upon which just at present they
exhibit most of their foolishness—are removed, there will be any
substantial agreement between you and them.

As I am not sure whether you may not wish to make use of my opinion, I
have written it in a separate form: but there are two other points on
which Edition: current; Page: [1836] you have not asked my advice, but
on which, perhaps, you and Mr Hunter will not object to my warning you:

1. The present difficulty arises from the presence of Miss Biggs4 as
Secretary. She is not vacillating at all. Her heart is wholly with the
other party: she prepares her measures quietly beforehand, is accustomed
to working by scratch committees, and any appearance of vacillation is
given solely by her having the good sense and self control to withdraw
from such steps as she sees cannot succeed. This only makes her the more
dangerous, and she will infallibly spring a mine on you some day which
will be successful, when she knows better the composition of the
Committee, and who are the active persons against whom she must be on
her guard. Her conduct in opening the subject after the Committee had
been adjourned for the autumn might form a sufficient ground for
removing her from the Secretaryship, and prudence would dictate the
using it as such. It is not true that the Society owes her any
obligation. She was thrust in by Mrs Taylor,5 to the general
disapprobation of the Committee, who reluctantly assented to her
employment because Mrs Taylor made it a personal matter to herself.
Civility and thanks are therefore all to which Miss Biggs has any just
claim in return for her services. I mention this lest the younger
members of the Committee should not be aware how matters really stood
when first Mrs Taylor insisted on taking in Miss Biggs as her coadjutor;
Mrs Taylor giving it as her reason to some of those who objected to it,
that she wished to find an interesting occupation for Miss Biggs, to
whom she was personally attached, and that the experience thus acquired
would be a great advantage to Miss Biggs. If, therefore, now, Miss Biggs
is treated with kindness and consideration of manner, it is all to which
she has any claim, and it would be culpable weakness to allow her to
remain in the Committee to the detriment of its efficient action, on the
plea of past services. So long as she remains in the Committee, you have
a quiet, steady opponent, who will betray you to the enemy, and take
advantage from within of all your weak points: one infinitely more
dangerous than Mrs Taylor ever could have been, because she knows her
own mind and can keep her own counsel, and will make any amount of
apparent concession for the purpose of remaining in her present place.

2. No opportunity should be lost of getting rid of the different members
whose votes are objectionable: and I cannot help thinking that if, in
spite of all that can be done, the opposite party insist upon forming an
independent Central Committee, and any of the members of the London
Committee consent to join it in their private capacity, they should be
requested to retire from the London Committee. I mention this merely
because I think it is well to be prepared beforehand in case of the
worst.

Please remember us very kindly to Mrs Grote. I consider my own health
quite reestablished. My daughter is still suffering from general
weakness and Edition: current; Page: [1837] headaches, which have
prevented her from writing to Mrs Grote since we have been abroad. I am

Dear Sir—

I thank you for your letter of July 4. It gave me much pleasure to
observe the more cheerful view you now seem to take of the moral &
political prospects of the U. States. This, in one so thoroughly alive
to the evils & dangers which exist, can only arise from the increased
energy of the struggle against them by the honest & intelligent majority
of the nation; & to this your letter bears direct testimony. As long as
there is “a deep well of conscience in the hearts of the people,”2 no
moral mischief will be able to get beyond a certain length without
exciting a wide spread determination to put it down; & when that is the
case, the future of mankind is safe even from any aggravated temporary
evils.

It is very gratifying also to hear from you that the condition of the
labouring classes of the United States is highly prosperous.3 Statements
have appeared in England which went to shew that from the great increase
of the cost of living in the U.S., principally arising from the tariff,
the wages of labour are no longer sufficient to give the labouring
classes the comfort & well being they have been accustomed to. This is
not very alarming, as the tariff would in that case be swept away all
the sooner; still one is glad to have it contradicted by such good
authority.

In the old country there is all that uncertainty in the prospects of
society for a generation or two to come which there must be when new
questions involving the whole structure of society have come to the
front while even the advanced minds & a fortiori the minds of all
classes are not yet prepared to take a rational & practical view of
them. The leaders of the working classes have as yet very crude ideas on
these questions, & our higher & middle classes Edition: current; Page:
[1838] have not yet got the length of seeing that the land question &
the relation between labour & capital are the points on which the whole
of politics will shortly turn; & that very soon no political question
will cause any other strong interest than may be due to its bearing on
these: with two exceptions however—minority (or rather proportional)
representation, & the condition of women, the last a still more
fundamental question than even those others & which may advance
independently of them to the only admissible issue, complete social &
political equality. It is much to be hoped that it will do so, for when
women are free agents their weight is sure to be on the side of an
adjustment of social difficulties not by a fierce conflict but by a
succession of peaceful compromises.

The arrangement made for the settlement of the Alabama dispute4 is as
you say, most happy for both nations & the new rules of international
law when generally adopted will be very favourable to the general peace.
The further advance you look for, the prohibition of all supply of
munitions of war to belligerents by neutrals, has much to be said for
it, but there are some things also to be said against it which have to
be considered. Of these, that which weighs most with me is that the
power of obtaining such supplies is favourable to the weaker
belligerent, who is, in the great majority of cases, the one most in the
right. It was not so in your slavery war, & it did not turn out to be so
in the late war between France & Germany. But weak nations attacked by
powerful despots & above all, insurgent nations attempting to throw off
a foreign yoke would be placed at a sad disadvantage, if thrown wholly
on their own resources for the material instruments of warfare.

I hardly know what ways to turn for the information you require
concerning the European experience of Foundling Hospitals.5 I know, in a
general way, that it is, or not long ago was, very unfavourable, & that
the establishments of this kind in England & France at least, have been
much more divesting themselves of their original character & assuming
that of charities for children of known parentage. It is however their
experience in this last character that would probably be of most use to
you, & if I can find the means of learning what documents there are on
the subject, I will endeavour to procure them. If you have not done so,
you will find some account of these institutions at Paris, in an article
of M. Maxime Du Camp in the Revue des 2 M. [Deux Mondes] of 1st Sept.
18706 entitled “Les Hospices à Paris. 1. Les Enfans Assistés.” The
writer’s opinions are not of much value but he supplies some materials
for judgment.

Dear Sir—

I have received your letter of Sept. 28 in which you do me the honour to
ask my opinion as to whether it is right that the inmates of prisons shd
be employed in productive labour, so as to defray wholly or in part the
expense of their maintenance, or whether the objection frequently made
to such employment, that it competes with free labour, is a valid
objection.

In reply I beg to say that I hold it to be a sound principle, both
economically & morally, that no person capable of work shd be maintained
in idleness at the expense of others, but that his labour shd always be
made available for or towards his own support. I also think that such
labour judiciously employed is a most valuable instrument of prison
discipline & of the reformation of offenders. It is moreover, in my
opinion an error to suppose that the employment of convicts in useful
work, diminishes the total amount of employment for free labour; since
the funds which are employed in setting the convicts to work are not
drawn from what would otherwise be paid in wages to free labourers, but
from what would be levied in taxation to support the convicts in
idleness or useless work. The only precautions to be observed are first
not to derange the labour market by a sudden irruption of a mass of
convict labour into some one particular branch of industry; next &
chiefly, that articles produced by convict labour shd be offered for
sale at the market price for goods of the same quality, & not at a price
reduced in order to force a sale.

In consequence of my absence from England I have only quite recently
received & read your MS.2 It is both well thought & well expressed, & I
agree in Edition: current; Page: [1840] its main principles. It bears
marks, however, of having been written, as you say it was, several years
ago, when the land question was in its infancy, & had not yet begun to
be a subject of public discussion & popular agitation. The question has
now reached a stage at which the statement of principles shd be
accompanied by a serious consideration of the means of carrying them
into practical effect: & this involves points on which you do not seem
to have meditated when you wrote the paper though possibly you have done
so since. For example, your paper seems to imply that if the land were
nationalized all taxation might be abolished: but this abolition, if
possible at all, could only be so by refusing any compensation whatever
to the landholders. The Land Tenure Reform Association being of opinion
that such refusal would be unjust, proposes to leave to the landholders
the present value of their land but to interrupt, for the benefit of the
nation, the future increase. Any one of your intelligence, writing on
the subject at present, would probably think it necessary to discuss
this proposal whatever view he might happen to take of it.

I shall be here for several months longer but I will return your MS. by

TO [J. K. HAMILTON WILLCOX?]1

October 10, 1871

Dear Mr [Willcox?]—

From my delay in acknowledging your two letters of April last, you will
probably have inferred quite correctly that the various criticisms on my
Free-Trade letter,2 which you kindly sent to me, did not seem to me of
sufficient importance to require that I should expend valuable time in
replying to them. I have generally observed that when a writing has made
as much impression as could reasonably be expected from it, (which from
what you tell me my letter appears to have done), the effect is only
weakened by returning to the charge, unless it be to add something
really important to the discussion. Mr. Greeley’s objection3 that the
high wages in the Edition: current; Page: [1841] United States cannot be
caused by cheap land and sparse population, since land is cheaper and
population sparser in Canada where wages are lower, deserves notice,
both on account of the man and the subject. But as it is not pretended
that the effect of these causes in producing high wages cannot possibly
be modified or frustrated by anything else, the Free-Trader can afford
to admit the fact as stated by Mr. Greeley.

It will not be contested that wages are at all events much higher in
Canada than in Great Britain. For the rest, my knowledge of Canada and
its circumstances is not sufficient to enable me to explain every part
of its economic condition. I should require to know, first, between what
parts of Canada and what parts of the United States the comparison as to
land and population and wages is made; secondly, whether the wages said
to be lower in Canada are wages in gold, and, assuming that they are so,
whether, when compared with the prices of articles of consumption,
augmented as these prices are by your tariff, they do not enable the
Canadian laborer to be fully as well off as his neighbor on your side of
the frontier. Finally, if those questions were all resolved in favor of
Mr. Greeley, the only inference that I should draw is, that the arts of
production are less advanced and the labor of the community less
efficient in Canada than in the United States; the natural effect of
which would be to keep wages lower than the circumstances of the country
with respect to land and population would otherwise make them. It should
be remembered also that (as you observe) Mr. Greeley’s sovereign remedy,
Protection, exists in Canada, though not to the same extravagant pitch
as in the United States.

I observe, by the way, that some of the Protectionist newspapers seem to
imagine, from the terms in which I expressed the opinion that Protection
in America was a mere deception, that I meant to charge its advocates
with being willful deceivers. Nothing could be more unjust, more
illiberal, or further from my thoughts than such an imputation.

Please make my acknowledgement to the Liberal Club for the great honor
they have done to my letter by giving it so wide a circulation.

Dear Mr Robertson

I certainly feel as much astonishment as regret that a vote of censure,
and of request to Miss Biggs to resign,2 was not passed at the last
Committee meeting; and it is very difficult to understand what motive
could have prevented it from being done, seeing that her own conduct has
forfeited all claim to forbearance. I cannot help thinking she must have
been as much astonished herself, and that her father was present in
order to present the accounts if needful, because she anticipated some
such vote. I can now only say that I recommend the passing such a vote
at the very first meeting, and that no pretext or reason whatsoever
should be allowed to stand in the way of doing so: with this difference
however, that whereas at the last meeting I think she should have been
requested to resign, at the next meeting I think a resolution should be
passed that Miss Orme be henceforward the sole Secretary. As for any
assertion that Miss Biggs has been chosen for one year, that can be of
no consequence now. It might have stood in your way in proposing to
replace her by Miss Orme merely on the ground of preference, but it can
have no force when it is proposed to replace Miss Biggs on the ground of
disapprobation of her conduct in the Leeds matter; upon which ground, of
course, the change or dismissal must rest: The Committee cannot have
chosen her for Secretary for a year and given her full license for a
year to act contrary to their wishes without their permission. Any such
pretension would only have to be stated in other words, for its
absurdity to be evident. Nor, while I recommend the use of the mildest
terms, such as “change” &c. in speaking of the dismissal, should I
hesitate to use the word dismissal should it prove necessary: and it
sometimes happens, more particularly with the Manchester school,3 that
blunt language is necessary for they can understand no other, and take
the reticence of good breeding or kind feeling for signs of weakness of
purpose. Moreover, it appears to me that if you have scruples in
carrying your measures either in the absence of the others, or by simply
overpowering them with votes by a majority however small, you may as
well give up the struggle. I speak from observation and experience of
the particular people concerned. I should be sorry that you should think
I recommend taking even an apparent advantage over absent opponents, or
denying them a fair hearing. I believe I should always wish to give my
opponents an ample hearing: but then they have had it; and having had
it, have manœuvred not Edition: current; Page: [1843] to give it to the
party at the Leeds meeting. After this, the matter is a battle and must
be treated as such; and as one in which, as (if we know them well, we
may be tolerably sure) the opponents will not scruple to take unfair
advantage, common sense on our part dictates our taking every fair
advantage, and giving them nothing but the strictest justice, without
one inch of generosity. You have already been a very great deal too
generous: it will have been a useful fault if it has thoroughly
convinced you that unfair advantage will be taken of anything of the
sort.

The fact is, that for some time past the common vulgar motives and
tactics that govern the vast majority of Committees and agitations of
all kinds, political and charitable, have been imported into the Women’s
Suffrage movement. At first, the movement was comparatively free from
anything of the kind, and our object I take to be, to keep a London
Committee in existence, still pure from all that sort of thing. Until
Mrs Taylor came under the influence of Miss Biggs and the Jacob Brights,
she was quite irreproachable in all such matters, and her own tastes and
instincts were always open and upright. I do not mean to blame the
various women who from motives of self-interest, of vanity or love of
notoriety, employ such tactics, any more than one blames the vast
majority of clergymen and other “respectable persons” connected with the
getting up of charitable and political organisations. But, in struggling
against them, one must look at them as they really are.

It is necessary for those who will condescend to no petty manoeuvres in
such a struggle, to replace them by extreme sternness and firmness; and
especially to be on their guard against ever allowing a preconceived
resolution to be overruled by unexpected movements or apparent yielding
on the part of the opponents. One must always bear in mind that it takes
frank people a long time to see through the devices of those who are not
frank; and that a decision that has been come to on mature reflection
should therefore be adhered to even at the risk of apparent obstinacy:
else you will be continually outwitted by one device after another, for
the quickest witted honest people can never be as quick in seeing
through a new trick, as some other people can be in inventing one. One
learns therefore by experience that on the whole it is always safest, in
such cases, to adhere to a resolution formed at leisure, in spite of any
objections suddenly presented to one. I am

Dear Sir Charles Dilke

I am very happy to hear that you have received several requests to speak
on the land question, and that you intend to do so. I regret that not
knowing that Mr Newmarch’s paper2 contained anything about our
programme,3 I did not read any report of it, and I only know as much of
what it contained as I have learned from subsequent articles in the
newspapers. As far as that knowledge goes, the point which seems to me
most to require notice is what he said about the Building Societies.4
That point was raised in the Committees of the Land Tenure Reform
Association, and my answer was, that I should except from the tax, the
increase of value of a house actually inhabited by the owner; as this
belongs less to his income than to his expenditure. But I would not give
this exemption on more than one house to the same person.

As to the questions you ask; my remembrance of Bleak House is so faint
that I do not understand Newmarch’s allusion to it.5 The bad management
of corporation property I think a valid argument as far as it goes, and
it is a strong reason with me and others for opposing the general
nationalization of the land. But what our programme proposes to
nationalize is the waste land, and to that the objection does not apply,
or applies in a very small degree; for a great part of the waste land we
desire to keep waste, and the remaining part, as it yields nothing at
present but spontaneous products, cannot well, under the worst
management, yield less. It is true, we propose that some land which is
not waste should be bought on account of the State; but this is avowedly
for the purpose of trying cooperative and other social experiments,
Edition: current; Page: [1845] which would only be followed up if
successful. The advantages of such experiments is felt by some who do
not think they would succeed.

One of the objections to us, which requires to be noticed, though it
could only mislead those who are really unacquainted with the programme,
is that if we take the increase of value of land, we ought to make
compensation when it falls in value. It should be pointed out that we
really do so, since any one, whose land falls in value, will be free to
give it up at the price put upon it before it fell. I am

TO GEORGE CROOM ROBERTSON1

Oct. 25. 1871

Dear Mr Robertson

The Resolutions forwarded to your Committee from the meeting at Leeds
are simply proposals to keep all other Committees independent of that of
Edition: current; Page: [1846] London, and to make the London Committee
dependent on all the others. Now, there can be no doubt that, up to this
time, the London Committee is that which, by its calm and judicious
conduct, has given dignity and influence to the movement for Women’s
Suffrage in this country. Those who are now endeavouring to replace it,
vainly imagine that it is the name of London that has done this. No
impartial observer can doubt that it will be for the advantage of the
agitation for Women’s Suffrage and indeed for the public estimation of
the friends of women’s rights altogether that there should still
continue to exist one body of such a character.

There is another point of importance, and that is, that the agitation
for the repeal of the C.D. Acts should be in nowise mixed up with that
for the Suffrage. To confound the two together, is to break faith with
the members of the Suffrage Society, many of whom totally disapprove of
the other agitation. I cannot help thinking that a proper feeling on
this point would bind every person who is conspicuous in the one
agitation to resign any part in the other. To make use of the one
organisation as a tool to bring in money and influence for the other, is
a breach of faith which I have the less hesitation in stigmatizing as it
deserves, because I am myself in favour of both, supposing them to be
carried on in a loyal and honourable manner.

Since, therefore, you ask my advice, it is my opinion that the judicious
course for the London Committee now to pursue, would be to refuse to
sink itself in any new body. It already forms an independent and equal
part of the National Society consisting of many independent and equal
Committees; and from that dignified and independent position I think it
should absolutely decline to move.2 Secondly, it appears to me that
those members of the Committee (and of course I need not say, any of its
officers) who have, without authority from the Committee, and without
its knowledge, given their names to the proposal to sink its separate
existence altogether, should at once be requested to resign, and, if
necessary, removed. They cannot be trusted by the Committee to carry out
its intentions; and have already given proof that they prefer to act
upon their own private opinions, even to an extent the perfect frankness
and honour of which is open to criticism, rather than to subordinate
themselves to the Committee as a whole.

Oct. 25. 1871

Dear Sir—

I am glad that you have written out your opinion so fully on the various
points connected with the land question. I cannot undertake to enter
with equal fulness into all the considerations which your letter raises,
but I will endeavour in few words to show to you that the programme of
the L[and] T[enure] R[eform] Assn. would if realized accomplish much
more good than you attribute to it.

You say it would not enable the working classes of the towns to obtain
more space for their dwellings. But what prevents them from obtaining
more space? Not the impossibility of getting land, for abundance of land
in & near towns can be bought & is bought every year; but that the price
of it is too high. And why is it too high? Because of the perpetual
increase of its value through the growth of the town’s population. If
this were taken by the State, there would be no motive to hold out for
an extravagant price & land could be obtained on much more favourable
terms for the extension of building.

Besides, if suburban land for building were ever deficient nothing
hinders the State from compelling the sale of land for the extension &
improvement of towns just as it now does for making new streets &
railroads.

With regard to rural land you say that to take for the public only the
“unearned increase” would not stop the population of the country
districts from being drawn into the towns. If in this you refer to the
conversion of agricultural land into deer forests as in the Scotch
Highlands, this would be stopped by enacting that all tracts of land
(above a certain small extent) which are left waste for more than a
certain number of years shall revert to the State, for a compensation
calculated on what the land brings in to the holder in its waste
condition. There is nothing in the programme of the L.T.R. Assn which
precludes this, & most of the members would probably be in favour of it.

But if you mean that private property in land causes a system of culture
to be practised which diminishes the agricultural population, it is for
you to show that the nationalization of the land would not do the very
same. If the land were managed as a branch of the public revenue the
tendency would be to manage it in the way which would bring in most
rent, & nothing worse than this is done by a private proprietor. In fact
what you object to in this case, is the saving of labour in agriculture.

Those who support the nationalization of the land are, I think, bound to
Edition: current; Page: [1848] state the plan on which they would have
it managed for the public account. In the present low state both of our
political morality & of our administrative habits, I shd expect that the
land department would become a mass of corrupt jobbing, against which we
see by the examples of New York &c.,2 that democratic institutions are
not an effectual security; & that as a financial measure it would be a
complete failure the proceeds realised being probably not sufficient to
pay the amount of compensation which even you would allow.

A few words on the subject of compensation. It appears to me that when a
great alteration is made in institutions which have existed from a very
early period of history with general approval, any expense, loss, or
other inconvenience which has to be temporarily incurred cannot justly
be laid on any one class, but ought to be fairly shared by the whole
community who are to benefit by the reform. I have very radical notions
as to what is the fair mode of sharing any burthen among the whole
community. I would throw a very large proportion of it upon property—not
all property, not property which has been earned by the industry of its
present possessors, but property which has been inherited, & forms the
patrimony of an idle class. But I see no justice in making those who
happen to have inherited land bear more of the burthen than those who
happen to have inherited money. I would lay a heavy graduated succession
duty on all inheritances exceeding that moderate amount, which is
sufficient to aid but not to supersede personal exertion. If the land
were nationalized and [the fund]3 for compensating the holders were
raised in this manner, the land-holders themselves would bear I think
quite fairly, a large share of the burthen.

You say, if it is not just to resume the land it cannot be just to take
away the unearned increase of its value. I say so too, if it be taken
without compensation; but the L.T.R. Assn proposes that the alternative
shd be allowed to the holders, of surrendering their land at its selling
value; on which condition the legitimacy of the operation must be
acknowledged by every one who ever voted for a railway Act.

Dear Mr Robertson

We can most heartily sympathize with your weariness and disgust at the
contest which has been forced on you. To fail in tactics in such a case,
though Edition: current; Page: [1849] vexatious, is almost an honour:
certainly quite one, if it is the first time in one’s life that one has
been so engaged. Nothing but experience can prepare a frank and
honourable person for such a contest. One is reduced to hope that the
experience thus acquired may be of use in the future. One certainly
requires some consolation for having been obliged to acquire it.

It would be quite useless (although I have no objection to your doing
it) to use my name to Mr and Mrs Taylor2 as to Miss Biggs. They already
know that we object to her. And moreover, nothing whatever that Mr or
Mrs Taylor could say, would have the smallest effect upon Miss Biggs. It
is she who influences them, not they her. As to Mrs Stansfeld,3 to her
the argument should be used, against the C.D.A. agitation being mixed up
with the franchise. I dare say my name might have some influence with
her.

I can only advise continuing to use your utmost efforts to weed the
Committee of the obnoxious set, and urging all our friends to give their
utmost help. If anything should depend upon it, Mr Biggs’ vote ought
certainly to be rejected, and Miss Biggs ought to be called upon to shew
the minutes of the meeting at which he was ever elected a member of the
Committee. If she has not kept any minutes, there cannot be a stronger
evidence of her unfitness for the office. If she has, she will not be
able to produce any evidence of his having been elected a member. Loose
unbusiness-like ways are among the methods of the slippery party, and a
firm stand should be made against them.

TO GEORGE CROOM ROBERTSON1

Avignon

Nov. 6. 1871

Dear Mr Robertson

I congratulate you very heartily on your success.2 It must indeed feel a
delightful deliverance after your most troublesome contest.

I would very willingly accede to the request you and the Committee put
in such flattering terms, were it not that I feel convinced that it
would still be best for the cause for me to keep distinct from the
Committee if possible. If it should prove absolutely necessary as a
means of giving your Committee Edition: current; Page: [1850] strength
in the fight, I would at a future time consent; and in the meantime I
have no objection at all to your making it known among all those who are
likely to be concerned in another Committee, that I shall give my name
to yours if there does come to be a public contest.3

In the matter of new members for the Committee: If I understand rightly,
you have six members on whom you can certainly rely: that is, when they
are all in town; but of whom one at least, Mr Hare, is often away on
business which makes it impossible for him to come up to town when he
pleases. I reckon, therefore only five votes certain.

The following is the table we make out:

4Included with this letter at UCL is a note dated Sept. 9, 1893, and
signed Charlotte A. M. Burbury: “The three marked _uncertain_ were among
the most certain. I was only reluctant to support the vote of censure on
Miss Biggs.”
5Probably John Macdonell.
7Louisa Courtenay, a neighbour and friend of Charles Dilke. She was also
a member of the General Committee of the National Union for Improving
the Education of Women of all classes.
6Probably Henry Joseph Wilson (1833-1914), business man and liberal
politician; supporter of Josephine Butler’s campaign against the
ContagiousDiseases Acts; MP for Holmfirth Div., Yorkshire, 1885-1912.
Certain
Uncertain
Perhaps hostile
Prof. Robertson
Mrs. Burbury4
Mrs Fawcett
Prof. Hunter
Mr Macdonell5
Miss Courtenay7
Miss Hare
Mr Wilson6
Miss Orme
Mr Thornton
Mr Hare

But then I should like to hear from you whether you think you can reckon
on Mrs Burbury for certain. We do not know her at all; but, as you think
so highly of her, shall be glad to have any opportunity of making her
acquaintance when in town. Mrs Fawcett also may perhaps be removed to
the column of merely uncertain: but I do not think she could ever be
more than uncertain. But we should much rejoice if she can be brought
right. She is quite public spirited, and is a recent convert to the
C.D.A. movement, which I do not think her husband sympathises in. All
this is favourable; but on the other hand, she has a prosaic literal way
of looking at things, and is apt to be, as I dare say you have noticed
Mr Fawcett also is, a little doctrinaire—to see a principle in its full
force, and not to see the opposing principles by which it must be
qualified. Hence she may at any time fancy that consistency demands what
I might think foolish conduct. But she would be valuable on the right
side, and doubly so because, if she is not right, she is likely to be
wrong.

If my table is correct (which I hope it is not) you can never reckon
with certainty on more than five good votes; and therefore it would be
very dangerous Edition: current; Page: [1851] to elect any new members
of whom you could not be certain. If, on the other hand, Miss Courtenay
goes out, and Mrs Burbury can be reckoned on with certainty, you will
have six certain votes against three uncertain. Still, this would only
leave margin for two new members, unless you can be certain of them, in
order to keep a certain majority of one voice, the very least with which
you can manage the Committee.

Now there is one thing the force of which I am not sure that you will
see at first, but of which, the more I consider it, the more I am
convinced: and that is, that your Committee, if judicious, will pass, at
the very first meeting, a vote as nearly unanimous as possible,
requesting Mrs Taylor8 to resume her place as Honorary Secretary.

Her name is more associated with the original Committee to the general
public, than that of any one else whatever. The Committee, with her name
still as Honorary Secretary, is still the London Committee; any other
must be a usurper. But with her name gone, it becomes a question, which
is the Committee: and even if I am on it, still it would appear like
something new in which I am concerned. Keep Mrs Taylor’s name, and the
others are the innovators, the introducers of discord. Lose her name,
and there is nothing to distinguish you from them. She would be the link
keeping up the continuity of existence between the old Committee and the
present. Then, again, you do not know when she may be persuaded to join
the others. You should have her with you, if only to prevent that;
merely because, if her name is in the other, the other will seem to
carry with it the weight of the old Committee. Now there cannot be a
doubt that it is Miss Biggs who has led her wrong: without Miss Biggs
you will find her tractable, and if she is not, you will always, I hope,
retain the power in your own hands of outvoting her. But I do not think
you will have trouble with her. She would never be an obstinate
opponent, at the very worst. Her fault is vacillation, and she is more
likely not to vote at all at a crisis, than to vote wrong. Then, again,
if you come to public meetings, how great an advantage on our side it
would be to have her as formerly for figure head. It would be carrying
on the old tradition: and her age, her appearance, that very feminine
weakness which is so evident about her, is invaluable for the purpose.
Her bitterest enemy cannot accuse her of being a strong-minded woman.
With her for Honorary Secretary, Miss Orme for the Secretary, and Mrs
Burbury for Treasurer, I should think you would do excellently. To the
public eye there will have been no change at all, and you will still
carry all the weight that the old Committee has acquired. Also Mrs
Taylor would then permit the old address, Aubrey House, to be used, and
perhaps that is worth while. Where have your meetings been held lately?
To Mrs Taylor herself the Committee should put the matter, that they
accepted her resignation because they understood her reluctance to be
concerned in anything like a personal contest with the other party: that
now the Committee Edition: current; Page: [1852] has fought out the
contest for itself, without implicating her, and would be glad to have
her in her old place among them, now that she cannot be implicated in
any unpleasant feeling in the matter.

I cannot suggest any new members on whom we can thoroughly rely, whose
names would add apparent weight: but I think that Mrs Taylor’s name
would be of more weight than any dozen others. The only other person
whom I can at present suggest is Sir Charles Dilke. I believe that if I
myself asked him, he would probably consent to join the Committee: and
you would have the advantage, that if he joins you, you secure his not
adding such weight as his name has to the other party. I could not feel
at all sure of how he would vote, but I fancy he does not like the
C.D.A. agitation: at all events he has not committed himself to it.

If you had the present Committee (without Miss Courtenay) with the
addition of Mrs Taylor and Sir Charles Dilke, I reckon that you would
have six votes certain right (supposing Mrs Burbury to be so), five
uncertain, and one (Mr Hare) occasional. It would be madness to add any
more members to the Committee of whom you are not absolutely certain:
and can you be absolutely certain of any one until after you have tried
them a little. I think not.

I think also that twelve is really quite enough for a good Committee.
When it is numerous, it gets unmanageable, and little parties form
within itself.

Pray weigh well what I have said about Mrs Taylor. In the peculiar
circumstances of the case, her name will weigh more than my own: besides
that I have the greatest objection to giving my own. We could at any
time have insured Mrs Taylor’s fidelity would either my daughter or I
have consented to give our names to the Committee. We did not decline to
do so because we could not have carried the Committee with us would
either of us have made that sacrifice, but because we both thought, as
we still think, that the true interest of the movement demands that a
good and competent Committee should exist independently of us, excepting
in so far as our friends may be disposed privately to seek our advice.

There is one more thing I could advise: that is, that you and Professor
Hunter should continue to be the practical managers of the Committee
yourselves. All well managed Committees are really managed by one or two
persons; and in practically managing the whole matter yourselves, you
are not taking any advantage of others, but are really conferring a
favour upon them. I am certain that this is the point of view in which
it would be looked at by Mr and Miss Hare and Mr Thornton. They will be
obliged to you for indicating to them the policy to be pursued, and
would be glad to feel that they can rely upon your judgment and
activity.

TO GEORGE CROOM ROBERTSON1

Nov. 15. 1871

Dear Mr Robertson

As I know by experience that it is uncertain whether my letter posted
today will be delivered in London on Thursday evening or Friday morning.
I write this to you at Univ. College.

Edition: current; Page: [1854]
I write in hopes that my letter may reach you in time to prevent any
repudiation on the part of your Committee of the statements put forth by
the seceders. The thing of all others that we have to desire is that
they would put the secession, and the disagreements in the Committee,
precisely upon the ground on which it appears that they have, with a
most happy shortsightedness, decided to put it. What I had feared was,
that they might attempt to give some other colour to the disagreements:
this, as to a difference of opinion as to associating the suffrage
agitation with the Anti C.D.A. being the one point on which we ought to
take our stand firmly and immovably, proclaiming it on all occasions,
publicly and privately, as the ground taken up by your Committee. Any
other conduct on the part of the Committee I look upon as simply
suicidal. Whatever apparent influence our opponents may seem to carry
with them among some of the friends of women’s rights will be more than
balanced by the enormous loss with the public in general: and it is this
shortsightedness with regard to the general public which betrays their
want of public spirit, or else of judgment, to combat which is the sole
object of the existence of your Committee. If the only object were to
lead into noisy activity those and those only who go all lengths in
favour of women’s rights, their policy would be excellent: their fault
consists in the fact that they absolutely forget, or do not know, that
the majority of the people of England have yet to be led to see the
propriety of giving women any rights at all. To the mass of the English
people, as well as to large numbers already well disposed towards some
little improvement in women’s condition, the union of the C.D.A.
agitation with that for the suffrage, condemns the latter utterly,
because they look upon it as indelicate and unfeminine. The question
then is, whether it is not desirable that one Committee should still be
in existence which is not utterly excluded from the sympathies of all
this vast mass, as well as of influential people who shrink from
vulgarity. The more distinctly your Committee places itself in this
position, the surer is its footing, the clearer its reason for
existence, and the stronger the sympathy likely to be felt for it by the
world in general.

As to the minor detail, that the seceders assert that your Committee and
I wanted to drive out those who were even members of the other
Association, it is doubtless a misrepresentation: but I strongly
recommend not correcting it, and passing it over in absolute silence for
the present. It may be contradicted in due time and place, if it should
seem desirable to take up that point of detail. In the meantime your
Committee should accept to the full the colour put upon the matter by
the opponents. Neither is there any harm, but rather good, in their
asserting that I am mixed up in the matter: let them do so
uncontradicted: I dare say I stand as high as they in the estimation of
the general public, and they will not damage me more than themselves.

The other point I have now to suggest is that the next move for your
Committee Edition: current; Page: [1855] will be some appeal to the
“London Society for Women’s Suffrage.” Whether this appeal had better
take the form of convening a meeting, or only of sending round a
statement of the dissensions, with voting papers, to every single
subscriber to the Society, I have not yet had time to consider, and
should like much to know what is the opinion of yourself and Mr Hunter,
as well as of the Committee. It might perhaps be well to lay this before
the Committee at this very next meeting; but I do not think that there
is any need for immediate decision, and it is better to weigh well every
movement, than to gain any advantages by immediate action. One thing is
certain: the other party will go on do what you will: the only question
is, how can we all of us do most to neutralize their mischievous effect
upon the general public. A single mistake on our part would do more harm
for this object than any number of apparent triumphs over us on their
part. The fact is, they cannot triumph over us except by doing mischief.

Could you ask Mrs Taylor to allow your meetings to be held at her house,
as a favour to the Committee, on account of the difficulty they have in
finding a room for the present. I would not scruple to put this as a
personal favour to the members of the Committee, and to ask it of her as
a kindness to the Committee, which after all is still that of which she
was the head for so long.

TO GEORGE CROOM ROBERTSON1

Nov. 27. 1871

Dear Mr Robertson

I am glad to find that you and Mr Hunter had arrived independently at
the same opinion as we had. It would appear from your last letter, as
well as from letters I have received from Mr Arthur Arnold and from Mr
Pennington,2 that the seceders profess the intention of doing nothing to
give publicity to the quarrel, and that the Committee they intend to
form will call itself a Central Committee, and not another London
Committee.3 Mr Pennington writes with great moderation, and I believe,
as far as he is concerned, with Edition: current; Page: [1856] perfect
truth. Mr Arthur Arnold writes very angrily, and asserts as a positive
matter of fact that there is now no lady on your Committee except Miss
Hare!

Mr Hunter’s paper appears to me very suitable. In regard to an appeal to
the London Society, I am not sure that it should be made at present, if
it turns out to be true that the seceders do not intend to profess
themselves a London Committee. As they assert that their object is to
anticipate the possible action of the Manchester people,4 they may do as
much good as harm, (supposing that they lay no claims to represent the
London Society) in as much as I think them a less detrimental set than
the Manchester people, with whom they are perhaps better qualified to
cope than people who are less like them. If at any time an appeal to the
Society should become necessary, I think on further reflection, that it
would be better not to make it by means of a meeting, which at best can
only represent those present at it, and at which there might be
disturbances. I think a better method would be a circular letter
addressed to each separate individual whose name is down as a
subscriber, and inclosing a halfpenny post card with an alternative vote
printed on it. In this way, the opinion of a real majority might be got,
if it should be thought desirable to get it.

I have not forgotten my promise to give my adhesion to you by name if a
conflict should arise. But this could be done in some other way than by
becoming an actual member of the Committee. If you would like to put me
down as Honorary President of your Committee, I should have no objection
to accept the post; but as neither my daughter nor myself are likely to
be able, for some time to come, to attend the Committee, we should both
of us prefer not to be actual members of it, and we think my name as
Honorary President would be as useful to you.

We are sorry to hear that Miss Hare, on her approaching marriage (we do
not know whether it is yet public, but we understand that it is to take
place in January next)5 will live out of London, and does not,
therefore, think she can remain in the Committee. Might it not be worth
your while to ask her to remain nevertheless? It will be very difficult,
I fear, to find good lady members. I do not know what you would think of
asking Mrs Westlake to return; if she did, she would probably lend her
house for meetings. There is also Mrs Grey,6 of 17 Cadogan Place, who
stood for Chelsea for the School Board, and who, to our knowledge, was
very lately much opposed to the Anti-C.D.A. Edition: current; Page:
[1857] agitation. She is a lady, and her age gives weight, but we do not
know much of her. I am afraid we cannot suggest any one else; the ladies
we could most rely on are unhappily more or less of invalids. But I do
not see why you should not choose for yourselves persons in whom you
have full confidence, and whom you could work comfortably with;
supposing that you think it necessary to increase the numbers of the
Committee. I myself think a small Committee best for work. However,
these are things for you to judge of; and now that you are freed from
associates against whose faults we thought ourselves qualified to warn
you, by a larger experience of them than you had had, I have no doubt
you will find much fewer difficulties and much less need of advice. I am

Dear Mr Robertson
 very truly yours

J. S. Mill

P.S. I need scarcely say that although, if the opponents give any
publicity to the differences of opinion, I should not hesitate to take
up the challenge, I still recommend avoiding anything of the sort as
much as possible, as long as they do.

Dec. 1. 1871

Dear Mr Leslie—

It gave me great pleasure to hear such a good account of your
improvement in health, & also to learn that you have been reappointed to
the India Civil Service Examinership, & that the work is increasingly
interesting to you.

I am much obliged to you for sending me your paper on Financial Reform.2
I need hardly say that I have read it with the greatest interest. You
have made out a stronger case than I was aware could be made, of
inconvenience & economic loss from the various restrictions on business
necessitated by the existence of any excise or customs. Still, this does
not decide the question, for every tax produces a great deal of
incidental mischief, & the problem is to find which are those that
produce the least. We have got to compare the evils of our remaining
indirect taxes with those of the best substitutes that it is possible to
provide in lieu of them. I cannot but think that Edition: current; Page:
[1858] to justify the entire abolition of indirect taxes there should be
some better substitute suggested than a shilling income tax. You take no
notice of the demoralizing effect of a tax of which the assessment
depends on people’s own returns of their incomes. I look upon this as a
very serious matter indeed. One who knew City people very well predicted
when the income tax was first laid on by Sir R Peel,3 that the
consequence of it would be a great deterioration of commercial morality.
Since then we have always been hearing complaints of the growth of
mercantile dishonesty; the most flagrant instances of it have been
detected where they were least looked for, & though of course it is
impossible distinctly to trace the connexion between this & the income
tax, I have never doubted that the tax has greatly contributed to it. A
false return of income has probably been in innumerable instances the
first dereliction of pecuniary integrity. That this evil must be still
further increased by every increase of the tax, could only be doubted,
on the supposition that this dishonesty is now so widely spread as not
to admit of any further increase. Besides, the evil would be actually
added to and increased by one of the most necessary improvements in the
income tax viz. that of requiring returns from those who at present have
their income tax deducted from their income at the time of receipt.
Nothing can be more unjust than to levy income tax from multitudes of
people whose income is below the limit at which the tax professedly
ceases, or at which the percentage is reduced, & throw upon them, poor,
ignorant, & busy as the most of them are, the burthen of bringing
evidence to get the money returned.

I wish that you, & all the really enlightened enemies of indirect
taxation, would turn your minds to contriving some less objectionable
mode of direct taxation than the present. The house tax considering that
almost all our local taxes, at least in towns, are of that nature,
cannot be much increased without making the overcrowding of dwelling
houses still worse than it already is. The succession tax is a resource
but not an unlimited one, for that too when the sum payable is large, is
too easily evaded. A tax on total expenditure would be the best tax in
principle, because it would exempt savings: but I do not see any mode of
imposing it which would not depend on the returns made by the payers;
not to mention that great objection would be made on the score of its
falling most heavily on those who have many mouths to feed.

Your friends of the Financial Reform Association4 do not feel any of
these difficulties because what they desire—& what most of the advocates
of exclusively direct taxation desire—is to throw the whole burthen on
what Edition: current; Page: [1859] they call realised property that is
to say on savings; which is certainly the reverse of expedient, & is not
just on any principles but those of Proudhon.

I have not insisted on the special reasons commonly urged for
maintaining taxes on stimulants, because it is possible that there may
be a satisfactory answer to them. Nor do I lay any stress on the utility
of custom houses, &c., for statistical purposes, because it may be
practicable by a system of fines to induce importers or producers to
make such returns as are required. These objections, though they have
some weight are plainly not decisive. But the moral objection remains, &
until some mode is pointed out of raising a large revenue by direct
taxation to which that objection does not apply I must think that our
indirect taxes had better remain, being only lightened from time to time
as the prosperity of the country increases their productiveness.

Thanks for your kind inquiries about my health. My indisposition was a
good deal exaggerated but has now quite left me. My daughter is still
ailing but has been rather better since the cold dry winds set in.

TO GEORGE CROOM ROBERTSON1

Dec. 4. 1871

Dear Mr Robertson

I hardly know what advice to give, because I am not sure whether you and
the Committee will quite go with my view of the best course to take, and
I do not hold with any great tenacity to my own.

I look upon it that the important thing for your Committee is much more
to be than to do, and I therefore can regard with equanimity the
progress which the other is sure to make. Methods will be adopted, and I
am certain have been adopted, which you cannot possibly emulate, and
they will have that amount of success which such methods usually have.
The essential thing appears to be precisely that a Committee should
exist which keeps clear of them.2 I ought however to add that in regard
to subscriptions, experience has taught us to be exceedingly sceptical
of the assertions made by the getters-up of Committees. For
instance—have you ever had any proof in the accounts of the Treasurer,
Mr Biggs, of the existence of the £500 Lecture Fund stated in the
newspapers to have been subscribed this year to your Committee? If so,
what has become of it? We have seen only a statement of the expenditure
from the Lecture Fund of something between £100 and £200 (to the best of
our recollection) and we know we sent in cheques for £100 ourselves.
What has become of the other £300 or more? Now it is Edition: current;
Page: [1860] our opinion that the greater part of this £300 was never
subscribed, and that it would be very hard upon poor Mr Biggs to call on
him to pay up whatever part of it cannot be shewn to have been spent.
Mrs Taylor at first was free from all these devices. I cordially hope
Miss Biggs was free to the last, and that you have got the £300 in
hand.3 But if, as I fear, you have not, you may console yourself by
reflecting that a large part of the subscriptions you hear of are in the
same predicament. The grateful astonishment with which cheques for the
full amount promised are received, combined with a comparison between
nominal receipts and actual expenditure, have opened our eves on this
matter: and we have been told it is an established maxim with Committees
in general, which we know is fully approved by some of the members of
the new Committee, that the statement that thousands have been received,
helps to bring in hundreds. I do not see what weapon you have against
all this except that of Time, and an established character. What is
founded on sham, tends to fall away: but I do not doubt that you will
lose subscribers for the present, and be the victim of all sorts of
misrepresentations. Still, if you are not able to do much, you can
secure that there shall exist in England one Committee, upright,
moderate and judicious; to be referred to if scandals should arise in
regard to others. This may seem a very modest office, yet it may be an
all-important one.

In regard to the Memorial, I see two courses to take. One would be, to
answer it formally and shortly, something to the effect that your
Committee regrets that some seceders from its body should have thought
fit to establish a new Committee, and fully agrees with the Memorialists
that the utmost pains should be taken to avoid any further appearance of
dissensions; that it understands that the other Committee disclaims any
hostile feelings, and that therefore an appeal to the whole body of the
Society would probably, when it became known to the general public, be
interpreted by it as a sign of graver dissensions than any that exist;
and that so long as the new Committee maintains the position you
understand it has taken up, of independent but not unfriendly action,
you think it would be most prudent not to make any more public than at
present the knowledge of such disagreements of opinion as there actually
are.

Another course would be, to state the ground you take up, and I inclose
a sketch to shew what I mean.4 From these two alternatives you will see
that Edition: current; Page: [1861] we think it best not to appeal to
the Society at present. But this opinion goes with our impression that a
modest quiet steady position is the only one at present practicable for
our Committee, and that we cannot pretend to rival the other in
newspaper paragraphs, sham subscriptions &c &c.

If, however, you do not agree in this opinion, and see your way to more
energetic action, I am not prepared to disapprove of it: because I am
convinced that your energy will be honest, and not sham. But if you have
any great expectations of success, I fear there will be disappointment;
because, even if you had not this sort of opponents to contend with,
success won by honourable means must be of very slow growth, and you
will find misrepresentations anticipating you in every direction. I
leave it, therefore, to your judgment and that of Mr Hunter what to lay
before the Committee, and therefore I do not write you any letter for
the purpose. I am

Dec. 5. 1871

Dear Mr Cairnes

On referring to your last letter, I am surprised to find that it was
written six weeks ago. It gave me news of your health, which, if not so
favourable as I had hoped from the surgical operation, was still good,
and I hope to hear that the improvement as well as that which you
reported in Mrs Cairnes’s health, has not only maintained itself, but
made further progress.

Your remarks on Laws of Coexistence2 came at a very good moment, as my
chief occupation for some time past has been the revision of my Logic
for a new edition to be published next spring,3 and I have retouched
some parts of what I had written on that point; though the alterations
and additions I have seen reason to make are not considerable. The
question is gone into rather more fully in Prof. Bain’s Logic than in
mine, and you would find there a good deal to illustrate, and perhaps to
confirm, your own views. With regard to those facts of coexistence which
as you say “have a manifest adaptation to each other as the teeth,
stomach and claws of an animal”, these are the ones which seem to me to
be par excellence referable to causation; they are probably explicable
by natural selection, or some other form of the evolution theory.
Undoubtedly they may be used as a basis for deductions but so may all
empirical laws, within definite limits of time, place, and circumstance.
There may be, and Mr Bain thinks there are, uniformities of coexistence
that are probably alternate; and I have never denied this, but have
maintained that in the logical proof and logical use of such
uniformities, they are subject to the same conditions as empirical laws.

I have not seen Mr Jevons’ book,4 but as far as I can judge from such
notices of it as have reached me, I do not expect that I shall think
favourably of it. He is a man of some ability, but he seems to me to
have a mania for encumbering questions with useless complications, and
with a notation implying the existence of greater precision in the data
than the questions admit of. His speculations on Logic,5 like those of
Boole6 and De Morgan, and some Edition: current; Page: [1863] of those
of Hamilton, are infected in an extraordinary degree with this vice. It
is one preeminently at variance with the wants of the time, which demand
that scientific deductions should be made as simple and as easily
intelligible as they can be made without ceasing to be scientific. I
look forward with much interest to seeing your notice of the book,7
which I am sorry not to see in the December Fortnightly. There is
another book lately published, called a Survey of Political Economy, by
a Mr McDonell,8 which the author has written to me about, and which I am
expecting to receive from Blackheath. This too, judging from reviews,
seems to be of little worth, unless possibly for hanging one of your
excellent articles upon. Have you seen it?

Lanfrey’s Life of Napoleon,9 of which the first volume (which appeared
in the Revue Nationale) is all I have read, seemed to me, as it does to
you, extremely valuable. It is a pity that he has accepted a diplomatic
appointment, which may interfere with his work as a writer.

I conjecture that the prediction of Mr Brace which he says has been
fulfilled, is that the people of the United States would not adopt Mr
Sumner’s view of the Alabama difficulty.10

My daughter unites with me in kind regards to Mrs Cairnes, and I am

Cher Monsieur—

Merci de votre brochure.2 J’y trouve, comme dans votre autres écrits des
idées, des pensées, et ce qui est plus rare, surtout en Edition:
current; Page: [1864] France, l’absence de toute prévention de parti: ce
qui fait que tous les partis y trouveraient quelque chose que
d’ordinaire ils négligent, en ne regardant pas assez. Quant à vos
conclusions j’adhère complètement aux deux principales; d’abord la
république, c. à. d. l’élection seulement temporaire du pouvoir
exécutif; ensuite que cette élection ne soit pas faite directement par
le suffrage universel. J’aurais désiré que vous eussiez exprimé une
opinion raisonnée sur le mode de l’élection. Un corps électoral spécial
qui aurait le droit d’élire le président me semble à tous égards une
mauvaise institution, à moins que ce corps ne soit lui-même nommé par le
suffrage universel: encore faudrait-il qu’il ne fût pas nommé uniquement
pour cela sous peine d’arriver au même résultat que celui des
États-Unis, où les électeurs sont tous nommés avec mandat impératif de
voter pour un tel, de sorte que le président est réellement élu par le
suffrage populaire direct. Pour empêcher cela il faudrait que les
électeurs spéciaux cumulassent avec leur devoir électoral d’autres
fonctions, assez importantes pour qu’en les nommant le peuple ne
regardât pas exclusivement au choix du président. Je ne vois en France
que les conseils départementaux et municipaux qui remplissent cette
condition, et attribuer à ces corps l’élection du pouvoir exécutif
pourrait être nuisible en faisant de toutes les élections à des
fonctions administratives encore plus qu’à présent une pure affaire de
parti politique. A tout prendre, le seul système qui me paraisse
convenable est celui de l’élection du pouvoir exécutif par l’assemblée
legislative. C’est là de fait, bien que ce ne soit pas en théorie le
système anglais: et c’est le seul qui n’expose pas le pays à des
conflits entre les deux pouvoirs—conflits qui pourraient paralyser le
gouvernement pendant des années entières à moins d’un coup d’état de
l’un ou de l’autre côté.

Je remarque qu’en concluant pour la république, vous vous servez
principalement des arguments propres à la recommander aux classes
supérieures. Cela est naturel et licite dans un écrit de circonstance.

Vous me demandez si je crois la France en décadence: C’est une question
qu’on pourrait se faire aujourd’hui dans beaucoup d’autres pays. A mon
sens la décadence morale est toujours la seule réelle. Qu’il y ait ou
non décadence morale en France je n’oserais le dire. Il est certain que
le caractère français a de très grands défauts, qui ne sont jamais plus
montrés que dans l’année malheureuse qui vient de s’écouler. Mais il
n’est rien moins qu’assuré que ces défauts n’ont pas existé au même
degré dans ce qu’on appelle les plus beaux jours de la France. D’un
autre côté les événements récents ont démontré un immense progrès, la
disparition presqu’entière de la férocité. Il n’y en a là, que je sache,
qu’un seul exemple bien caractérisé l’événement déplorable de la
Dordogne. Du reste, nous sommes dans une époque où l’on doit s’attendre
partout à un relâchement transitoire des liens moraux: attendu que les
anciennes croyances qui créaient un idéal, une règle, et un frein, sont
très affaiblies et que les nouvelles qui doivent les remplacer
n’existent guère pour Edition: current; Page: [1865] le grand nombre et
ne sont pas assez affermies chez les esprits avancés, n’étant pas encore
entrées dans l’éducation. Une condition nécessaire de progrès n’est pas
une décadence, quoiqu’elle y ressemble quelquefois à beaucoup d’égards.

Ce qui m’inquiète davantage c’est l’insuffisance intellectuelle de la
génération présente pour faire face aux difficiles et redoutables
problèmes d’un avenir qui a l’air d’être très prochain.

Je crains aussi que la guerre civile de Paris ne soit fatale à la
disposition d’esprit nécessaire pour juger convenablement ces questions
épineuses; et que l’exaspération mutuelle des deux partis n’éloigne plus
que jamais chacun d’eux d’écouter ce qu’il y a de juste et de
raisonnable dans les réclamations de l’autre. Quelque dangereuse que
soit l’extrême crudité des idées des socialistes révolutionnaires, ce
qui m’alarme beaucoup plus c’est l’effroyable abus de la répression par
le parti aujourd’hui victorieux, aux yeux duquel il suffit d’avoir
désiré le moindre des changements qui ont figuré dans le programme de la
commune pour être un ennemi de la société, et qui semble vouloir
massacrer ou déporter en masse s’il est possible, tout le parti opposé.
J’avoue que dans les dispositions actuelles du parti de l’ordre,
l’unanimité politique des classes supérieures que vous espérez obtenir
par la république ne me semblerait promettre qu’un effort violent pour
tenir la classe ouvrière en sujétion par tous les moyens usités de la
tyrannie monarchique—moyens qui seraient même portés à un plus grand
excès par des classes dominantes que n’oserait le faire aujourd’hui un
seul homme. Et si par ces moyens on venait à supprimer pour un certain
temps toute tentative de résistance légale ou violente, on ne se
servirait pas de ce répit pour mettre les questions sociales à l’étude
dans le but de donner une satisfaction légitime aux aspirations
naturelles de la class ouvrière; non, on s’endormirait comme sous le
régime impérial pour se reveiller au milieu d’un bouleversement général.
Voilà ce que je crains pour la France, et à un moindre degré pour les
autres pays de l’Europe.

Quant à la France j’avoue qu’en vue de l’avenir, et même d’un avenir
proche, il me semble que la meilleure ressource serait dans le
fédéralisme. Ce serait là le moyen d’adoucir la transition à une autre
organisation sociale; en permettant aux novateurs de faire des
expériences limités, sans entraîner avec eux des masses de population
qui n’en veulent pas et qui s’y opposeraient par la force si on tentait
de les mettre en oeuvre chez elles.

Ma fille se recommande aux bons souvenirs de Mme D. White à qui je vous
prie d’être l’interprète de mes hommages.

Jan. 18. 1872

Dear Mr Robertson

My opinion is most decidedly against making any appeal to the Society
for their support against the seceders.2 It is not the part of the
London Committee to display before the enemies of Women’s Suffrage the
fact that its active supporters have fallen out among themselves; and
with however much moderation and good taste it might be done, it would
probably lead to altercations, recriminations, angry correspondence in
newspapers, with names and personal details, which in this town would
provoke and might even require replies, and no one can foresee how much
the unseemly spectacle might be prolonged or how far it might extend.
Hardly anything that could happen would tend so much to bring the cause
into discredit; and nothing but a public attack by the other side, of
which at present there are no signs, could in my opinion justify the
London Committee in descending into the arena.

It must, however, be remembered that the next ordinary meeting of the
Society, at whatever time it may be held, forms a limit beyond which the
reserve which is so desirable on the subject of the dissensions cannot
be prolonged; and it will therefore be a point for consideration
whether, at some time between now and the next general meeting, the
members of the Society should be invited by circular to give their votes
upon a specific question or questions, in which no reference should be
made to the past, but which should bring into direct issue the continued
existence of the London Committee, and the willingness of the members to
retain their connexion with it. There is no necessity for coming to an
immediate decision either for or against this course. If you wish for an
opinion from me on its advisability, I could not undertake to give one
without some time for consideration.

I cannot come to the meeting of the Committee, but must continue to
decline, as I have always done, taking any action as a member of the
Executive. Edition: current; Page: [1867] I may add that should a
meeting be called, either public or of the Society, it will be
impossible for me to be present at it in any capacity. I am

Jan. 29. 1872

Dear Dr Carpenter—

I am much obliged to you for sending me your two Lectures3 & the paper
on Common Sense,4 all of which I have read with much interest.

I have long recognised as a fact that judgments really grounded on a
long succession of small experiences mostly forgotten or perhaps never
brought into very distinct consciousness, often grow into the likeness
of intuitive perceptions. I believe this to be the explanation of the
intuitive insight thought to be characteristic of women, & of that which
is often found in experienced practical persons who have not attended
much to theory nor been often called on to explain the grounds of their
judgments. I explain in the same manner whatever truth there is in
presentiments. And I shd agree with you that a mind which is fitted by
constitution & habits to receive truly & retain well the impressions
made by its passing experiences, will often be safer in relying on its
intuitive judgments representative of the aggregate of its past
experience, than on the inferences that can be drawn from such facts or
reasonings as can be distinctly called to mind at the moment. Now you
seem to think that judgment by what is called common sense is a faculty
of this same kind: & so far as regards the genesis of it, I think you
are right; but it seems to me that there is a very great practical
difference. The reason why in Edition: current; Page: [1869] the cases I
have referred to the intuition is often more to be trusted than the
reasoned judgment is precisely (I apprehend) because it is not an affair
of common sense but of uncommon sense; the perceptions & experiences
which have culminated in the intuitive judgment were peculiar to the
individual & cannot be recovered. If these evidentiary matters could be
recalled, the superiority of deliberate over hasty judgment would
reassert itself. Now in the case of common sense the very words imply
that the evidences which are the real justification of the judgments are
familiar to all mankind; & if they are so I apprehend that enough of
them can always be recovered & put into a distinct shape to admit of
subjecting the point to a real scientific test. Now when this can be
done, it always ought. For want of it, judgments by common sense are
usually judgments by superficial appearances. Almost all false political
economy, for instance, is made up of judgments by common sense.

On the physiological side of psychology your paper raises questions of
great & increasing interest. When states of mind in no respect innate or
instinctive, have been frequently repeated the mind acquires, as is
proved by the power of habit, a greatly increased facility of passing
into those states, & this increased facility must be owing to some
change of a physical character in the organic action of the brain;
whether in the organ itself we do not, I suppose, know. There is also
considerable evidence that such acquired facilities of passing into
certain modes of cerebral action can in many cases be transmitted more
or less completely by inheritance. The limits of this power of
transmission & the conditions on which it depends, are a subject now
fairly under investigation by the scientific world & we shall doubtless
in time know much more about them than we do now. But as far as my
imperfect knowledge of the subject qualifies me to have an opinion I
take much the same view of it that you do, at least in principle.

Your explanation of the self delusion of so called Spiritualists is no
doubt in many cases a true one, but for my part I believe there is much
more of absolute lying in their pretended experiences than people
generally like to suppose. I am altogether incredulous as to any
foundation of truth at all in it.

TO AUBERON HERBERT1

V[ictoria] S[treet]

Jan. 29. 1872

Dear Mr Auberon Herbert—

Your impression, as shown in your letter, of the mental state &
tendencies of the working men, agrees very much with that which with
probably fewer Edition: current; Page: [1870] means of knowledge than
you possess, has grown up in my own mind. From the little experience
which I have had, which chiefly relates to the more advanced portion of
them they seem to me to have but a narrow range of thought, but to be
much more open than either the higher or middle classes to appeals made
to them in the name of large ideas & high principles.2 I believe that
they, less than any other class, turn away contemptuously from the
supposition that life may be inspired by other objects than self
interest in the lower sense of the term: that they have a good instinct
for discovering who are those that are really single minded in their
public professions & acts, & when they perceive this, will trust them
not less but all the more for considerable differences of opinion on
many matters. I also agree with you in the main as to the kind of
cultivation which it is of so much importance, in a social & political
point of view, to give to their moral nature. But it is not clear to me
that this want can be supplied in the way that has presented itself to
you.3 I am not sufficiently informed as to matters of fact, to know
whether there is any considerable number of working people with active &
inquiring minds who could be made to adopt as one of the great interests
of life the learning & teaching of branches of knowledge unconnected
with the political & social advancement of their class. My idea is (but
I am open to correction) that for some time to come, politics & social &
economical questions will be the absorbing subjects to most of those
working men who have the aspirations & the mental activity to which the
appeal would have to be made & that the moral lessons you wish them to
learn can be most successfully inculcated through politics. You wish to
make them feel the importance of the higher virtues: I think this can be
most effectually done by pointing out to them how much those virtues are
needed to enable a democracy & above all any Edition: current; Page:
[1871] approach to socialism to work in any satisfactory manner. Again
they might perhaps be made ashamed of pursuing their political &
economic objects from class selfishness instead of disinterested
principle: they might for instance be shamed out of the exclusive
regulations of many of the trades unions by inducing them to aim at the
benefit of the entire labouring population instead of their own trade
only; & it would be a vast moral improvement if this can be taught (for
which the best of them I believe are now to a great degree prepared) to
claim on principle for women all the rights which they demand for
themselves. Then again the lesson of the great importance of other
social functions than that of manual labour cannot be successfully
impressed on them by any persons but those who enter into their own
views of politics sufficiently to sympathize in the desire to get rid of
any artificial privilege in favour of those social functions & of any
institutions that tend to limiting the access to them to particular
classes of mankind. Therefore without doubting that the kind of
associations you desire to encourage would be very beneficial in
proportion as they could be realized I shd have more hope from teaching
the same lessons in & through politics & economics, & from the
acquisition of political leadership of the working classes by persons
who would make working class objects their main business in politics but
who would pursue these on the strictest principles of justice & with
reference solely to the general requisites of social well being & who
would use all the influence they acquire with the working classes by
advocating their cause to inculcate this as the only admissible mode of
discussing & deciding social questions.

TO PASQUALE VILLARI1

A[vignon]

Feb. 28. 1872

My dear MR Villari—

You needed no apology for not writing oftener; & if you did, I should
need it as much. But our feelings towards each other do not require
letters to keep them alive, & when independently of other work, one has
too many letters to write, one’s surest friends are the most likely to
be put off.

You judged truly that the loss of Mr Grote2 leaves a great blank in my
life. He was the oldest & by far the most valued of my few surviving old
friends. And though he died at a ripe age, he seemed to bear his years
so well that I hoped there might yet be a considerable prolongation of
them. But if one lives to be old oneself one is certain of losing those
whom nothing can replace, & I have had too sad experience of this to
feel the shock of a fresh instance very acutely. It is just so much
taken from the value of life to me. It is pleasant to hear from you that
he was so much appreciated & is so much regretted in Italy. It is one of
the signs which continually come unexpectedly of the hopeful course in
which Italy is moving on. I fully appreciate the difficulties which you
have so well pointed out. But it seems to me that there is a most
encouraging mental activity among the (unfortunately too narrow)
educated class in Italy, & there is as there has always been a
foundation of practical common sense in the people, which is a safeguard
against great & fatal errors such as, for instance, are so often
committed by the French.

As you most truly say, the great problem is moral & intellectual more
than political;3 & you are probably helping on the improvement of your
Edition: current; Page: [1873] country still more by devoting yourself
to authorship, in addition to the work of a professor, than by any
administrative employment even in the department of public instruction,
in which you would be dependent on a superior (& what is worse, on a
succession of superiors) for the power of carrying out your ideas. If
you write what becomes the standard book on Machiavelli,4 you will do a
service not merely to Italian but to European thought, & will help to
train the thinkers of the time to come, which has become the chief thing
that I also much care to do during such years of working power as remain
to me. Mr Grote’s example is encouraging as to this hope, for he worked
at Aristotle up to his last illness; & his book,5 which is now printing,
will, though not complete, be, I have no doubt, a most valuable
exposition & appreciation of the more abstruse parts of Aristotle’s
philosophy. My own work lies rather among anticipations of the future
than explanations of the past. I would gladly if I could contribute
something in a more direct form than I have yet done towards rendering
the great new questions which are rising up respecting life & society a
little less difficult to our successors. But it is doubtful whether this
can be done at present to much purpose (except in the negative way of
dispelling actual error); for the impending transformation of society
can only be tentative; the experience necessary for seeing far into it
can only be obtained when the change is already in partial progress.

We shall be at Avignon now probably for a considerable time & I shall
hope to hear from you there.

le 4 mars 1872

Monsieur

Je vous remercie de votre lettre du 9 janvier. Mon ignorance de la
langue Danoise me fermant tout accès direct au développement
intellectuel de votre intéressant pays, je vous en ai d’autant plus
d’obligation lorsque vous voulez bien me fournir des renseignements.
Ceux que vous me donnez sur le progrès des idées libérales sont très
encourageants. Je me réjouis du grand succès de vos leçons à
l’Université. Je ne m’étonne nullement de l’opposition des professeurs
de la faculté philosophique à votre placement officiel. C’est la
répugnance bien connue des vieilles idées contre les nouvelles.

Vous me demandez mon opinion sur l’Internationale.2 Je crois que cette
Association renferme une foule très diverse de représentants de toutes
les écoles socialistes, tant modérées que violentes. Les membres anglais
dont je connais personnellement plusieurs des chefs, me paraissent en
général des hommes raisonnables, visant surtout aux améliorations
pratiques dans le sort des travailleurs, capables d’apprécier les
obstacles, et peu haineux envers les classes dont ils veulent faire
cesser la domination. Mais j’avoue que dans les débats de leur Congrès
je n’ai guère trouvé quelque bon sens que chez les délégués anglais.
C’est que mes compatriotes ont l’habitude d’attendre des améliorations
plutôt de l’initiative individuelle et de l’association privée que de
l’intervention directe de l’Etat. L’habitude contraire qui prévaut dans
le Continent fait croire aux réformateurs qu’ils n’ont qu’à mettre la
main sur les rênes du gouvernement pour arriver promptement à leur but;
et non seulement les socialistes français, qui sont même peut-être plus
modérés que beaucoup d’autres, mais plus encore ceux de la Belgique, de
l’Allemagne, et même de la Suisse, sous la direction apparente de
quelques théoriciens Russes, pensent qu’il n’y a qu’à exproprier tout le
monde, et abattre tous les gouvernements existants, sans s’inquiéter,
quant à présent, de ce qu’il faudrait mettre à leur place. Je ne les
calomnie pas, je ne fais que Edition: current; Page: [1875] répéter ce
que j’ai lu dans leurs journaux. Je crois, par conséquent, que le bon
côté de cette Association consiste principalement dans les craintes
qu’elle excite. Elle fait penser les classes qui possèdent les biens de
ce monde, au sort qui les attend peut-être dans l’avenir si elles
n’arrivent à rendre l’état social beaucoup plus avantageux au grand
nombre. Encore la peur est-elle une mauvaise conseillère, comme on voit
aujourd’hui en France. Pourtant un temps viendra où le danger sera
regardé avec sangfroid et où les problèmes sociaux seront mis à l’étude
avec une volonté réelle de trouver une meilleure solution que celle d’à
présent. Il faut que les hommes éclairés s’occupent en attendant de
préparer les esprits et les caractères.

Vous me demandez encore si on a écrit quelque chose de bon sur la
question des femmes, ainsi que sur l’utilitarisme. La question des
femmes est entrée dans la discussion générale, mais ce qu’on écrit
là-dessus depuis quelque temps n’a tout au plus qu’une valeur de
circonstance. Quant à l’utilitarisme, on a publié dernièrement plusieurs
articles contre mon livre,3 mais je n’y trouve jusqu’ici rien de neuf.
Ce sont toujours les mêmes objections, à peine rajeunies par le langage.
Je n’a jugé à propos de répondre à aucune de ces attaques: aux vieux
arguments il suffit des vieilles réponses. Cette dispute pratique se
vuidera avec la dispute théorique, entre la métaphysique de l’intuition
et celle de l’expérience: et sur ce champ-là, le progrès scientifique
assure la victoire à cette dernière. Cependant, si on publie soit sur
l’utilitarisme, soit sur la cause des femmes, quelque chose digne de
fixer votre attention, je vous en avertirai avec plaisir.

Recevez, cher Monsieur, mes salutations amicales.

Dear Mr Cairnes

I write to you rather because I have not written for a long time than
because I have anything very interesting to communicate. But I know that
you take a friendly interest in the facts of our daily life. We have
gained nearly two additional months of spring by coming here so early,
and though we have still occasional chilly weather, such as England so
often has in May and even June, we have escaped the return of real
winter that you have had in England and which you seem to be still
enduring. We have varied our stay here by a week’s excursion in Southern
Provence—Hyères, St Tropez &c. which has a still warmer climate than
this and where we found hawthorns in flower and meadows white with
narcissuses in the very middle of March. I have no report to make of
work done: I have written nothing, but have occupied myself with
bringing up arrears of general reading, correcting proofs for new
editions of my Logic2 and Hamilton,3 and examining old letters, to make
a clearance of those which are no longer worth keeping. In this last
operation I have reread with much pleasure many old letters of yours,
nearly all of which, both for the marks of friendship they are full of,
and for the intrinsic worth of their contents, are much too valuable not
to be still treasured up. I hope to receive many more of them before I
die, and one very Edition: current; Page: [1880] soon, to tell me that
you are, if not better, at least not worse than when I last saw you.

My own health is good, and Helen though still in the same weak health,
is on the whole better than she has been at some former times.

There is very little pleasant in the state of public affairs either here
or in England; perhaps rather more in America, Italy, and Germany. But
one mourns to see the persons of the highest worth, and who were
individually centres of important influences, passing away one after
another. The last few weeks has deprived the world of two such persons,
Mazzini and Maurice.4 The best consolation is that the essential part of
their work was done; and the influence of their lives will still be
continued by their memory.

April 14. 1872

Dear Sir

I willingly inclose an expression of opinion on your qualifications,2
such as my knowledge of your writings enables me to give. I am much
aided in doing so by the pamphlet which I have had the pleasure of
receiving from you,3 and which shews that you have applied the same
clear and vigorous intellect to the subject of ethics which was
conspicuous in your logical speculations. Whether your opinions and my
own on that subject would altogether agree is in such cases a secondary
consideration. I should not fear to defend Kant’s maxim4 against your
criticisms: He could not mean, nor could Paley mean,5 that we should so
act that the whole human race could with general benefit do exactly what
we are doing; they meant that our conduct ought to be capable of being
brought under a rule to which it would be for the general benefit that
all should conform. This rule, in your example of taking orders, would
not be that all mankind might with public advantage take orders, but
that the choice of a profession should depend (under limitations which
could be stated) on the aptitudes and convenience of the individual.

One more remark. I agree with you that the right way of testing actions
by their consequences, is to test them by the natural consequences of
the particular action, and not by those which would follow if every one
did the same. But, for the most part, the consideration of what would
happen if every one did the same, is the only means we have of
discovering the tendency of the act in the particular case. In your
example from Austria, it is only by considering what would happen if
everybody evaded his share of taxation, that we perceive the mischievous
tendency of anybody’s doing so. And that this mischievous tendency
overbalances (unless in very extreme cases) the private good obtained by
the breach of a moral rule, is obvious if we take into consideration the
importance, to the general good, of the feeling of security, or
certainty; which is impaired, not only by every known Edition: current;

violations ever occur.

.

From my knowledge of Mr Venn’s writings, I have been impressed, in an
unusual degree, by the clearness, vigour, and precision of his
intellect, as well as by his power of putting his clear ideas clearly
and forcibly into words. These qualities are apparent as well in what he
has written on ethical as on logical subjects: and on both he has shewn
decided power of original thought. I am not sufficiently acquainted with
his positive opinions in moral philosophy, to know how far I agree or
differ with them; but in the case of a public teacher, his actual
doctrines are of less importance than his influence in stimulating the
exercise of thought in his pupils, and at the same time guarding them by
an exact Method, from the evils of vagueness and looseness in thinking:
and in both these respects I think it likely, judging from his writings,
that Mr Venn would be a highly successful teacher.

Dear Mr Courtney

The case of the shareholders in the Bombay Bank,2 which was
irretrievably ruined, mainly by the fault of the Government, is shortly
to be brought before the House of Commons.3 I believe it is very
generally felt, by those who are acquainted with the facts, that the
conduct of the Bombay Government was inexcusable; but people think it
dangerous to admit that a Government which by the breach of solemn
duties causes the ruin of individuals ought to make them any reparation.
If I could induce you to read a printed statement of the case, drawn up
by Colonel Cowper of the Bombay Staff Corps, known to me for many years
as one of the most careful and accurate staters of facts with whom I
have ever been in official relation, you would be able to judge whether,
if that statement cannot be answered, the misconduct of the Government,
in reliance on whom the stockholders risked their money, was not such as
to create a moral obligation of indemnifying them for a part at least,
if not the whole of their loss. I am

TO COL. THOMAS ALEXANDER COWPER1

A[vignon]

Apr. 21. 1872

Dear Cowper,

I have no influence with the manager or editor of the Times,2 indeed I
am inclined to think they would be disposed to thwart rather than
promote anything in which I take an interest. Neither could I well ask
an editor to publish a private letter of my own. But I am acquainted
with one of the best writers in the Times,3 & if I could induce him to
read & pay serious attention to your pamphlet,4 some good might be done.
I therefore inclose a note to him5 which, if you think fit you may
forward, & I advise you to post at the same time to the same address a
copy of your pamphlet. I will see if there is anything I can do to
induce any of the other London papers6 to attend to the subject. I
suppose they have all received copies of the pamphlet; but it may be
advisable to refresh their recollection by sending others.

With regard to the Land Tenure Assn my opinion has all along been that
it is better not to have a general meeting in London this year and that
we shd for the present content ourselves with spreading our roots in the
provinces through public meetings there & the circulation of pamphlets.
I expressed this opinion very decidedly the last time I saw Mr Evans,7 &
I left England with no intention of returning soon enough to attend a
meeting this season. Of course my opinion would be different if speakers
were forthcoming sufficient to make the meeting a brilliant success: but
a meeting unless better than the former one would seem worse, & we shd
lose instead of gaining ground. About the Executive Committee, have we
lost any of them except Mr Andrew Johnston?8 Is there likely to be
opposition to the reelection of the present Committee with some other
good name instead of his? Auberon Herbert or Lyulph Stanley9 or Somerset
Beaumont10 would perhaps be willing to come into the Exve if they are
not already members of it which I think they are not.

Edition: current; Page: [1885]
I return Mr Newman’s11 letter. The experience of the Bristol meeting if
correctly interpreted by him, is against sending two persons from the
Committee to speak at a provincial meeting. But this I believe has not
been done by the work of the Committee, but at the express request of
the local promoters of the meetings. Mr Newman thinks it better to send
a lecturer than a speaker, & he may be right; though the local opinion
shd in some degree be consulted on the point. I fear that it is easier
to obtain two speakers than one lecturer. It is more necessary, too that
a lecturer, than that a speaker, shd represent our intermediate
standpoint. An authorised lecture which either went beyond that point or
stopt short of it would expose us to injurious misconceptions. If Col.
Ouvry12 would prepare & deliver a historical lecture from his own point
of view, which has made so great an impression on Mr Newman, it would
[tend] both to inform the public mind & to stir it up. Either a speech
or a lecture by Mr Newman himself, grounded on the ideas in his letter,
would also do good.

Mr Newman is under some misapprehension as to the opinions I have
professed. I do not say that “all the land of the country ought to be
national.” I think this a question of time, place, & circumstance, & I
incline to Mr Newman’s opinion that people shd at any rate be allowed to
own the houses they themselves live in, & even some space of ground,
ornamental or other, adjoining. But his idea of aiming only at a maximum
limit for landed property, though it might have been worth consideration
in some former states of opinion would now merely make the working
classes hostile instead of friendly to us. Nor do I see that much would
be gained by merely cutting up the great landed properties into estates
of 5000 acres each; Mr Newman’s plan with respect to suburban land is
the same as ours, with the addition that the power of compulsory
purchase should vest in the municipalities instead of the State; a
question of detail which we have left open.

Messrs Longman’s bill seems right except that it calls the pamphlet
“Mill on Irish Land Tenure”.13 They seem to have sold 331 copies to the
public & 2100 to the Association. Whether that number of copies would
have cost the Assn less if they had been their own publishers the
experience they have since had in printing the report of the public
meeting will probably have shewn.

I do not remember if the Echo has expressed any opinion on the affair of

shareholders have what appears to me a conclusive case against the
Bombay Govt, giving them the strongest moral claim to a partial if not
total indemnification for losses for which several of the principal
officers of the Govt are responsible as having been officially Directors
of the Bank & the Govt itself as grossly neglecting the duty of
superintendance & persevering in that neglect after all kinds of
warnings. The history of the case has been written in a pamphlet by Col.
Cowper, of whom I can say from many years experience that his statements
of fact are the most implicitly to be relied on both for fairness &
accuracy of any which came before me during my official life. The
pamphlet has no doubt been sent or will be sent to you, & if you will

Dear Mr Arnold—

From your knowledge of Indian affairs you have probably paid some
attention to the case of the Bombay Bank.2 It has always Edition:
current; Page: [1887] seemed to me that although the Bombay Govt was
only a shareholder in the Bank, yet as high officers of the Govt were
officially members of the Board of Directors which did all the mischief,
& as the Govt itself not only neglected the duty of supervision but when
repeatedly warned, even by the Govt at Calcutta, persisted in
disregarding the warnings & even withheld from the Calcutta Govt the
information it demanded at a time when the disaster might still have
been prevented from being complete; the Bombay Govt is bound in morality
& honour to indemnify partially if not wholly the shareholders, who
undoubtedly risked their money in reliance on the supervision exercised
by the Government through the official Directors. The case will shortly
be brought before the H. of C. & a word from the Telegraph3 on the
subject would be of great importance. Should you be disposed to say
anything in favour of the shareholders you would find abundant material
in the history of the case given in a pamphlet by Colonel Cowper, one of
the ablest men in the Bombay Service, whose statements of fact I learnt
by experience when in the India House that I could always rely on, both

May 6, 1872

Dear Sir—

I thank you for the copy of the 2d edit of your book on Causation.2 I
quite agree in its leading doctrine, & have maintained the same in my
System of Logic, viz. that there does not exist in nature any other
necessity than the necessity of logical sequence, in other words the
certainty that a conclusion is true if the premises are true. But this
definition does not explain to people the necessity which they fancy
they find in the relation of cause & effect, which they conceive, above
all, not as a conditional but an unconditional, or absolute necessity.

I think this feeling of an imaginary necessity can be no otherwise
explained than as I have explained it, namely by the law of inseparable
association, but that explanation appears to me sufficient. You are
probably, however, right in thinking that the notion of physical
necessity is partly indebted for the particular shape it assumes in our
minds to an assimilation of it with logical necessity.

I will add two criticisms on detached points:

At p. 118 your objection to my definition of cause seems to me to
proceed from your not having sufficiently realized the full meaning of
the word “unconditionally,” which, however I do not think I can explain
more clearly than I have done in my Treatise.

At p. 174 you say that no definition of matter can be given except that
it is that which gravitates. I apprehend the real definition of matter
to be that which resists. That whatever resists gravitates is a fact of
experience not involved in the concept.

Dear Madam—

I am glad to hear that the College has a class in Pol. Economy. I
inclose a set of questions which I hope may suit your purpose, & shall
be happy to report on the answers.

My daughter desires to be kindly remembered to you.


[The enclosed questions]

1. What is the distinction between Productive & Unproductive Labour, &
between Productive & Unproductive Consumption?

2. Does all Productive labour tend to increase the permanent wealth of
the country?

3. State any causes, in general operation, which tend to increase the
productive power of labour, & any which tend to diminish it.

4. Explain in what sense the value of a commodity depends on supply &
demand, & in what sense on cost of production.

5. What cost of production is it which determines the exchange value of
the products of agriculture?

6. A state of free trade being supposed, can a country permanently
import a commodity from a place where its cost of production is greater
than that at which it could be produced at home?

7. What are the effects, first on the national wealth, & secondly, on
the wages of labour, of a large government expenditure? & does it make
any difference what the expenditure is upon?

8. In what respects are the interest of the labouring classes & that of
the employers of labour identical? & in what respects, if in any,
opposed?

9. What is the meaning of depreciation of the currency? & what are the
principal consequences of such depreciation?

10. By what means can a currency be protected against depreciation?

11. What is meant by the term, a favourable & an unfavourable exchange?
& is there any well grounded objection to that phraseology?

Edition: current; Page: [1892]
12. How far, & in what respects, is the discovery of new & rich deposits
of the precious metals a benefit to the national wealth?

13. Mention the principal circumstances that tend to produce either a
rise or a fall in the rent of land.

14. State what are the known modes in which the produce of land, or the
proceeds of the sale of that produce, are shared among the different
classes of persons connected with the land, & state briefly the
advantages & disadvantages of each.

TO JOHN MORLEY1

A[vignon]

May 11. 1872

Dear Mr Morley—

If you shd decide not to stand for the Professorship2 I confess I shd be
glad of your decision, because on the one hand the Professorship is
likely to be of pecuniary importance to Mr Leslie & on the other I shd
be afraid lest the undertaking of additional work might possibly affect
either your health or the time you can give to the Fortnightly. I am
very desirous that the F. shd continue, & increase rather than diminish
in importance & I think you exercise a wider influence through it than
you could do through the Professorship. My daughter & I shall hold
ourselves ready to assist either pecuniarily or by writing or in both
ways whenever you decide to recommence the fortnightly publication.

With regard to the Irish University question,3 my notion of a really
national university for any country, but especially for a country
divided between different religions, would be a university in which
instead of only one professor of history, of ethics, or of metaphysics,
there should be several of each, so that as long as there are subjects
on which interested people differ, they Edition: current; Page: [1893]
might be taught from different points of view; & the pupils might either
choose their professor, or attend more professors than one in order to
choose their doctrine, examinations & prizes being made equally
accessible to all. If Trinity College were reconstructed on this
principle, there might be Catholic & Protestant & freethinking
professors of all these subjects & in this way it seems to me that
Catholics would obtain all that they can justly claim; for their only
tenable ground for refusing to receive education along with Protestants
is that Protestants & Catholics necessarily take different views of
those subjects. Fawcett’s bill4 certainly does not provide for this; but
this I think would be its ultimate result; & I shd be sorry to see any
settlement of the question which would prevent this. Considering
moreover how very noxious the higher instruction given by the Catholic
prelates is sure to be, I think it right to avoid by every means
consistent with principle the subsidising it in any shape or to any
extent.

Dear Mr Arnold—

Your “answer” in the Telegraph2 was so excellent that no other was
needed; it was rather I who shd have written sooner to thank you for it.
If anything could have helped the injured shareholders your article
would have done so, & it must have materially contributed to the
impression made by their case, an impression which leaves some opening
for future efforts.

The article inclosed in your letter3 (which was sure to be as you say it
was, Edition: current; Page: [1894] attacked and misrepresented)
certainly does express a very general & most natural “longing” among
those who have outgrown the old forms of religious belief. I myself have
more sympathy with the aspiration, than hope to see it gratified, to the
extent of any positive belief respecting the unseen world: but I am
convinced that the cultivation of an imaginative hope is quite
compatible with a reserve as to positive belief, & that whatever helps
to keep before the mind the ideal of a perfect Being is of unspeakable
value to human nature. Only it is essential, to prevent a perversion of
the moral faculty, that this perfect Being, if regarded as the Creator
of the world we live in, shd not be thought to be omnipotent.

TO JOHN ELLIOT CAIRNES1

May 15. 1872

Dear Mr Cairnes

Thank you very much for your two letters. The improvement you report in
your health, even though not extending to the rheumatic complaint, is
still a change much for the better. Troublesome and disabling as the
complaint is, it happily does not touch your mental powers, nor diminish
your interest in the matters to which those powers are so usefully
devoted.

I should like much to read what you have written on the two points you
mention in the theory of value.2 You say that on one of them our
difference is merely verbal; I suspect it is so on both, relating only
to the most convenient or most scientific mode of expressing the same
doctrine. The two modes, which you contrast with one another, of
expressing cost of production, are, I imagine, both of them admissible,
and both of them useful, as presenting different points of view. Of
course, when we go down to the fundamentals of the matter, the cost to
society, as a whole, of any production, consists in Edition: current;
Page: [1895] the labour and abstinence required for it. But, as concerns
individuals and their mutual transactions, wages and profits are the
measure of that labour and abstinence, and constitute the motives by
which the exchange of commodities against one another is immediately
determined. That, at least, is my present view of the matter.

The check which the Women’s Suffrage movement is now sustaining,3 is
what we predicted last year,4 when it was permitted to be identified in
London with the Bright and Becker set.5 The mixing up of the suffrage
movement with that against the C.D. Acts, which instead of disclaiming,
Mr Jacob Bright in his speech did his utmost to confirm,6 is but one
example of the total want equally of good taste and good sense with
which they conduct the proceedings.

Whoever may be elected to the University College Professorship, the loss
of you will be severely felt. But it is satisfactory that there is no
scarcity of more or less eligible candidates. You know better than I Mr
Courtney’s special qualifications in Political Economy.7 I fear Morley’s
constitution is delicate, he has already suffered from overwork, and if
to this were added the labour either of teaching or of studying so large
a subject, I should fear that his health would entirely give way unless
he either gave up or neglected the Fortnightly which would be a great
evil. Of all the candidates Leslie seems to me to have much the
strongest claims in reference to this special subject; & I should
rejoice if he were successful, because I esteem and value him, and
because I know no one on whom a little worldly success would have a more
beneficial effect.

Edition: current; Page: [1896]
Have you heard a rumour that the Government intend to extricate
themselves from the Irish Education difficulty at the expense of the
Queen’s Colleges, namely by disendowing them? If there be truth in this,
it is very serious, as the device is not at all unlikely to succeed. The
mischief to Ireland would be greater than even the endowment of a
Catholic College would be.

Brace’s article8 does him great honour; and American feeling altogether
is shewing itself in a manner most creditable to the nation. That, after
all, is very much more important than the settlement of the particular
dispute, even though this should for the present fail.

I am happy to say that Helen has now really come to an end with Buckle,9
and it will be published, probably, in two or three weeks from this
time.

We think of starting for our tour in Styria in about a fortnight.
Letters addressed here will be forwarded, and we hope to hear from you
at least as often as we do now.

Helen joins me in kind regards to Mrs Cairnes, whose health, we hope,
continues to improve, and we hope to hear good accounts of the rest of
your family. I am

I expect to leave here next week for my German tour, and shall go to

be at Bozen very early in June, at Heiligenbluth about the 15th, and at
Gloggnitz and Graz early in July: and you can write to me Poste Restante
at any of these places.

I believe I shall be nearest to Munich at Bozen and Gloggnitz: unless,
indeed, I have time at the end of my tour (at the end of July or
beginning of August) to return by way of the Engadine, in which case I
shall probably be at Innsbruck towards the end of July, and that will be
my nearest point to Würzburg.2 If I hear from you at Heiligenblut,
Gloggnitz, or Graz, I can Edition: current; Page: [1897] write and let

May 19, 1872

You are probably aware of your father’s connection with a short-lived
periodical of considerable literary merit, founded, I think, about 1828,
and called the “Metropolitan Quarterly Magazine.”2 It was there that he
published the article3 on account of which a passage in the second of
his Cambridge lectures shows him to have retained an abiding feeling of
self-reproach.4 That he should have done so is proof of a tenderness of
conscience which may even be called excessive, for the article, which
was an extremely clever quiz of the style of Bentham’s “Book of
Fallacies,” was in substance an attack, quite legitimate from his point
of view, upon what he considered as fallacious in Bentham’s own modes of
reasoning. I remember another article in the same periodical, which I am
almost sure I understood at the time to be his; a powerful denunciation
of ‘Blackwood’s Magazine.’5 the most striking article, as I remember,
which the publication contained during the short period of its
existence.

You are probably aware of the striking articles which he wrote in some
of the early numbers of the “Westminster Review.”

I particularly remember one on Montgomery’s “Pelican Island,”6 and one
on Theobald Wolfe Tone’s “Memoirs;”7 and I mention them because, young
as he then was, the powers of mind and range of thought and feeling
shown Edition: current; Page: [1898] in them on subjects not specially
connected with theology would make them well worthy of being included in
a republication of his minor writings, should such be contemplated.

I was a member of the London Debating Society; during about two years
that your father was a member of it, he was not a very frequent speaker,
but your uncle Sterling was, and together they formed a third
intellectual party or nuance, opposed both to the Benthamite and to the
Tory sections which used to fight their battles there.8 It was to that
time that I owed the commencement of the strong and permanent friendship
between Sterling and me, and the greatest part of the personal
acquaintance I ever had with your father. He and I were never intimate,
but we used to have long discussions together on philosophy, religion,
and politics; from which, though I do not think either of us often
convinced the other, I always carried away, along with a most lively
impression of his mental powers and resources, ideas both new and
invaluable to me. Indeed, his conversation and that of Sterling were
almost my first introduction to a line of thought different from any I
had previously known, and which, by itself and by its effects,
contributed much to whatever mental progress I subsequently made.

It was during the same period that your father and Sterling wrote
frequently in the “Athenaeum,”9 which, under their influence and that of
their friends, sent forth many valuable thoughts, and maintained an
elevation of character very uncommon, both then and now, in literary or
any other periodicals. I had no knowledge of the authorship of the
particular articles, on which you are probably much better informed.

After those years, your father’s path and my own, both in life and in
speculation, were widely apart, and our direct intercourse was small and
at considerable intervals; but I remained an assiduous reader of his
writings, and was always a sympathising as well as admiring observer of
his career.10

Dear Mr Villari—

I am extremely obliged to you for the trouble you so kindly took
respecting the Geological Map. Your information fully answered Edition:
current; Page: [1899] the purpose. I wrote to Audriveau-Goujon2 &
obtained from him Collegno’s map.3

When I received your letter I did not possess, at Avignon, a copy of the
tract on Land Tenure4 which you expressed a wish to see. I have now
obtained one, & send it to you by this post. If it had been anything
like what the Revue des Deux Mondes represented it to be,5 I should not
have failed to send it to you. But it is a very slight thing
indeed—neither a manifesto of the Radical party nor the programme of a
new party. It is simply a few pages in explanation of the objects of an
Association founded for a special purpose, viz., to reclaim for the
State whatever rights in the land it has not unconditionally parted with
to private persons: including among other things the right to impose
special taxation on landed property, to the extent of the increase of
value which it is continually acquiring in a prosperous country from the
mere growth of wealth & population, without any labour or outlay by the
proprietors. There is a party among our working classes who go much
further,6 demanding the resumption of all land by the State, with more
or less of compensation to the landholders. A time may come for
something of this sort, but what is proposed by the Society is as much
as I think desirable (not to say attainable) for a considerable time to
come. I am sorry that that little tract has been reviewed in the Deux
Mondes by a person so ignorant of my opinions as to call me a partisan
of extreme centralisation. It is about the last reproach I shd have
expected. But a large class of French writers make assertions of facts
with a levity almost incredible.

We are going very shortly to make a tour in Styria & other parts of the
Austrian Alps, but letters addressed to me here will be forwarded. I
hope to have a letter from you soon.

TO GEORGE CROOM ROBERTSON1

Avignon

May 23. 1872

Dear Mr Robertson

Many thanks for your friendly attention to my recommendation on the
subject of the Professorship.2 Mr Leslie has been very successful as a
teacher, Edition: current; Page: [1900] and I hear it is very likely
that the Irish Professorships will cease to be subsidized by the
Government, which would probably lead to his having to resign the one he
holds.3

With regard to the suffrage movement, it is not obvious what purpose
would at present be answered by calling a meeting of the subscribers, or
entering into communication with them by circular. What proposal have
you to lay before the subscribers, or for what ostensible object would
the appeal be made to them? Not, surely, for the sake of publicly
denouncing the mismanagement of the other party,4 and exhorting the
friends of the movement to adopt you as their leaders instead: It must
therefore be to propose some active step: but what step is there to take
except to go on propagandising in a quiet way, as you are already doing,
by lectures and otherwise? Another public meeting, in competition with
that of the other party, would only involve the London Committee in the
same or a still greater fiasco. The public are tired of the subject, and
their interest cannot be revived during the present session. The power
of the London Committee to be of use to the movement depends on their
keeping themselves absolutely free from the injudicious and undignified
fussiness by which the other party have so much injured it: and of all
things the most fatal to the cause for a long time to come, would be the
spectacle of two sets of people publicly competing for the lead of it,
with all the necessary consequences of such a rivalry. All this must be
fully apparent to you, but you have not shewn how such a result could be
avoided. It is to be feared that the movement will have to sink still
lower than at present before it can rise again under new leadership.
When the present leaders let the reins drop, disgusted with the failure
they have caused, or when they have fallen into such discredit with
their followers that they can make no serious resistance to being
superseded, then the time of the London Committee will have come, if it
has meanwhile kept itself clear of all similar discredit; but any public
demonstration just now would be a humble adoption of the unsuccessful
tactics of the other party. Their obtrusive activity requires even an
exaggerated quietness and calmness on the part of those who wish to be
distinguished from them. The policy of the London Committee is quietly
to let the fruit ripen, while it continues itself ostentatiously
inactive. Any action on its part now, will only expose it to sharing, in
the eyes of the general public, the contempt and dislike which the other
party have drawn down, for the present, on the subject. I am

May 30. 1872

Monsieur—

Je vois avec regret et avec quelque surprise que depuis bientôt cinq
mois j’ai reçu votre livre (L’Avere e l’Imposta)2 sans vous avoir encore
remercié de ce don et sans avoir obtempéré au désir flatteur que vous
avez exprimé de connaître mon opinion sur vos conclusions. C’est que je
n’ai trouvé que tout récemment le temps de donner à cet ouvrage la
lecture sérieuse qu’il merite. Aujourd’hui même je suis forcé d’abréger
ce que j’aurais à dire sur votre livre.

D’abord en tant qu’ouvrage d’économie politique pure, je n’ai que des
éloges à en faire. La seule critique que je crois pouvoir faire c’est
qu’en traitant (p. 83) de la manière dont un impôt sur les profits
industriels et commerciaux retomberait sur le consommateur vous ne
semblez pas peutêtre distinguer suffisamment entre un impôt général sur
les profits de tout capital productif et un impôt qui frappe seulement
ceux de quelques branches de production. D’après les principes généraux
de la politique la possibilité de faire retomber l’impôt sur les
consommateurs me paraît manquer dès que l’impôt frappe toutes les
industries sans distinction.

Comme ouvrage non pas d’économie politique abstraite mais de haute
politique votre livre est plein de choses vraies et utiles; mais j’avoue
je n’en trouve pas la conclusion suffisamment établie. Vous soutenez que
la règle de la justice en matière d’impôt, savoir que chacun doit payer
en raison de son avoir, exige qu’il y ait deux genres d’impôt, l’un sur
les dépenses improductives, et l’autre sur le capital; et que le
possesseur d’un capital, après vous payer comme les autres sa part de
tous les impôts de consommateur, doit payer en dessus un impôt
proportionné à son capital productif. Or je ne suis pas ennemi de
l’impôt sur le capital; je trouve assez probable, qu’à cause de
l’incertitude et de l’effet si démoralisateur de l’impôt direct sur les
revenus on viendra à imposer le capital comme moyen d’en atteindre les
profits. Mais je ne trouve pas que dans le système que vous proposez
chacun payerait proportionnellement à son avoir réal. Votre opinion me
paraît ressembler à celle de quelques Socialistes, qui, parceque les
profits du capitaliste et son capital sont tous deux compris dans son
avoir légal, oublient qu’il ne peut réellement jouir de tous les deux,
mais bien de l’un ou de l’autre à son choix. Il n’obtient ses profits
qu’à condition de faire consommer son capital par d’autres: s’il s’en
sert pour sa propre jouissance il renonce à en tirer du profit. Edition:
current; Page: [1902] Or l’égalité dans l’impôt me paraît consister en
ce que chacun paie à proportion de ce qu’il peut appliquer à la
satisfaction de ses propres besoins. Tant que son capital reste
productif il n’en tire pas plus d’avantage personnel que si ce capital
lui avait été confié par l’état, sauf le privilège qu’il n’aurait pas
alors de le gaspiller sans être responsable à personne.

P.S. Mon adresse à Londres est maintenant 10 A[lbert] M[ansions] &c mais

I am no admirer of the English climate, which I think deserves the worst

universal, even in Provence, one of the driest climates in Europe. We

Dear Mr Cairnes

Your letter reached me a considerable time after its date, in the heart
of the Styrian Alps, which we have found quite as beautiful and
enjoyable as Edition: current; Page: [1903] we expected; as we have also
those of Carinthia, & Carniola. We had, however, a good deal of rainy
weather up to the last fortnight, and since that ceased we have found
the heat much greater than is pleasant.

I wish your letter had brought a better account of your health. I regret
to have in that respect nothing to congratulate you upon, except the
strength of mind with which you bear up against so serious a misfortune,
retaining all your interest in the public, and seeking consolation in
continuing to work for science & the general good. This, indeed, is only
what might have been expected of you. I shall be very glad to see what
you have written on the theory of value.2 Your decided opinion that the
question between us is not chiefly verbal, or relating only to the best
manner of setting forth the same truths, makes me think it likely that I
have still something material to learn from you on the subject; and I
think it very improbable that on a question of abstract political
economy, after explanation, we should not agree.

What you say in your letter about the University College election in
reference to myself is very kind and friendly.3 For reasons which I have
already mentioned, I regret that the choice did not fall on Leslie: but
your opinion of Mr Courtney’s qualifications for the Professorship is
entitled to great weight, and has no doubt much helped his election; and
if it is not to be Mr Leslie, I prefer it to be Mr Courtney.4

Freeman5 belongs emphatically to what is called the historical school in
politics and jurisprudence; he has the good qualities and the weaknesses
of that school. Their error is, as is so often the case, a half truth
giving itself out for the whole; for they are quite right in thinking
that a good political institution is more likely to take a deep root
when it has been called for by a felt want of the people, than when it
has been set up by a king or a revolutionary leader on the strength of
its general merits. But this truth is continually Edition: current;
Page: [1904] perverted into an attack on the use of reason in matters of
politics and social arrangements; and Freeman does not sufficiently
guard himself against this perversion.

Votre lettre m’est parvenue au milieu d’un voyage en Autriche et je n’ai
pas pu lui donner une réponse immédiate. Je l’ai mise de côté avec le
projet de vous écrire à mon premier loisir un examen détaillé de votre
réponse à mes objections au sujet de l’impôt sur le capital. Cependant
en Edition: current; Page: [1905] relisant cette réponse il me semble
que tout ce qu’elle contient avait été dit avec une grande clarté dans
votre livre même et que ce que vous ajoutez dans votre lettre n’est
qu’un résumé des mêmes arguments. En tout cas vous n’avez pas ébranlé
mon objection fondamentale, savoir que le capital, tant qu’il reste
capital productif, n’a d’autre valeur pour le capitaliste que celle du
revenu qu’il donne et que par conséquent si on le fait payer sur le
capital et aussi sur toutes ses dépenses il est en réalité imposé deux
fois. J’accorde qu’on peut justement exiger de celui qui vit sans
travailler sur le revenu de son capital ou de sa terre une plus grande
contribution que de celui qui gagne un revenu équivalent en travaillant,
aussi ai-je toujours demandé une réforme de l’income tax dans ce sens.
Mais cela est principalement vrai pour ceux qui doivent leur fortune à
l’héritage et non à leur propre travail antérieur; aussi c’est surtout
par l’impôt sur les successions que je voudrais rétablir, en cette
matière, la justice sociale.

Quant à publier un article sur votre livre2 ce serait un plaisir pour
moi, mais il est incertain si je pourrai disposer du temps nécessaire.
J’espère pourtant que je pourrai écrire une notice raisonnée en deux ou

Sept. 22. 1872

Dear Sir Charles Dilke

Excuse the delay in answering your letter, which was caused by my
receiving it in the midst of a tour in the Austrian Alps.

I quite agree with you as to the importance of making some movement to
prevent the destruction of natural or artificial objects of general
interest. France has set us the example, by making a register of all
Monuments Historiques,2 none of which when so registered can lawfully be
destroyed or injured by a proprietor, or by any local or merely
departmental authority; though I have known a triumphal arch pulled down
by the Ponts et Chaussées3 because it had not been entered in the
Register.

Edition: current; Page: [1906]
The cry of confiscation may be met if the proposal is simply to make a
list of all such interesting objects, Roman camps and Druidical circles
included, and to provide by law that none of these may be destroyed or
altered by the proprietor without his first giving the public the option
of buying it from him for the equivalent of what it is worth to him in
its existing state.

I perceive that Sir John Lubbock4 has given notice of a motion for next
session for the preservation of historical monuments. It will be a great
advantage to be able to act in concert with him; and if his contemplated
motion does not go the whole length of what is desirable, he might
perhaps be induced to enlarge its scope. I am

Messieurs

Je viens seulement de recevoir la première feuille de la troisième
édition2 de la traduction de mes Principes d’Economie Politique avec
prière de compléter la liste de mes écrits traduits en français.

Outre les quatre livres qui sont déjà dans votre liste, il y a des
traductions françaises de trois autres de mes écrits: d’abord
Utilitarianisme, dont la traduction faite par Mademoiselle de Peyronnet
(aujourd’hui Lady Arthur Russell)3 paru d’abord dans la Revue Nationale
et a dû être republiée dans un petit volume par Charpentier,4 éditeur de
cette Revue.

Ensuite, un volume que j’ai publié sur Auguste Comte et le Positivisme,
a été traduit par M. Clémenceau5 et publié, si je ne me trompe, par la
maison Germer Baillière.

Edition: current; Page: [1907]
Enfin, mon ouvrage sur la Philosophie de Hamilton a été traduit par le
traducteur de L’Assujetissement des Femmes, M. E. Cazelles,6 et publié
par Germer Baillière.

Agréez, Messieurs, l’expression de ma considération toute particulière.

Dear Sir

I have only just received your note of Aug. 27, and I regret that your
visit to London has coincided with our absence. We have just concluded a
tour in the Austrian Alps, and are now likely to remain for some time at
the little place where we had formerly the pleasure of seeing you, and
where you will be heartily welcome should your occasions again lead you
to this part of the world.2 Meanwhile we shall be most happy to hear
from you, and to know whether we can be of more use to you in England.

We have left Blackheath Park, and our present address in England is

Dear Sir—

I thank you for the three numbers of the Anti-Game-Law Circular,2 which
I have read with much interest. No one has a worse opinion than I have
of the present Game Laws & their administration & I would rather there
were not a head of game left in England than that the existing injustice
shd continue. But I do not find in the papers you sent, any clear &
explicit statement of what, in the opinion of the League, the law on
this subject ought to be. The opinions indicated are that there shd be
no laws whatever respecting game as game, & that wild animals until
taken or killed shd not be property, but when taken shd be the property
of whoever takes them. In the former opinion I am inclined to agree but
in the latter I am not satisfied. It seems to me just that wild animals
shd belong to those at whose expense they have been fed; the nearest
practical approach to which is that they shd belong to the occupier of
the land on which they are taken or killed. Neither does it seem to me
that the plan shadowed forth in the Circular would of itself terminate
the evils arising from game-preserving. It is not, I suppose, intended
to permit any one who pleases to kill game on other people’s land
without their permission. But if not, then until the lavish preservation
of game comes to be stamped by public opinion with the disapproval &
contempt which it deserves, it is likely still to go on; nor for this
purpose Edition: current; Page: [1909] should there be need of a new law
of trespass: the more rigid enforcement of the existing trespass laws
would suffice. There would be still more shutting up of paths & other
thoroughfares than there is at present. The fields & woods would be as
carefully guarded against trespassers as they now are against poachers,
& the highways & such paths as could not be stopped would be shut in
between fences, to the great loss of all wayfarers & lovers of rural
walks. I presume all these points will be fully discussed in the
Circular as it proceeds but until I am satisfied respecting them I
cannot, by joining the League, identify myself with the particular means
by which they seek to attain our common object.3

Oct. 4. 1872

Dear Mr Cairnes

We have now been here about three weeks since the conclusion of our
tour, which was prolonged for two or three weeks more than we had
expected. We have had an uninterrupted succession of beautiful scenery
from the beginning to the end, and yet the result is to make us
appreciate not less, but, if possible, more, the characteristic beauty
of our own Vaucluse. In point of health the excursion has been
beneficial to us both: me it has quite set up; it has not done so much
for Helen, but though still very weak, she is materially better than in
the spring.

We have had from Thornton very recent intelligence respecting both your
health and your literary proceedings; the latter more agreeable than, to
our sorrow, the former was. The two volumes of Essays,2 I suppose, are a
republication of some of your contributions to periodicals, and well
worthy they are of being so collected and preserved. I am more and more
desirous of the completion of your other book.3 Your discussion of the
question whether wages ought in any sense to be considered as cost of
production, or whether that term should be exclusively predicated of
labour and abstinence, was always likely to be scientifically
instructive, but I now perceive that it will have a special value de
circonstance. You must have been struck as I have been, by the
thoroughly confused and erroneous ideas respecting the relation of wages
to price, which have shewn themselves to be almost universal in the
Edition: current; Page: [1910] discussions about the recent strikes. The
notion that a general rise of wages must produce a general rise of
prices, is preached universally not only by the newspapers but by
political economists, as a certain and admitted economical truth; and
political economy has to bear the responsibility of a self-contradicting
absurdity which it is one of the achievements of political economy to
have exploded. It provokes one to see such ignorance of political
economy in the whole body of its self-selected teachers. The Times joins
in the chorus, notwithstanding Mr Courtney,4 who, I do hope, has no hand
in the matter. Certainly no one who knows, even imperfectly, what the
Ricardo political economy is, whether he agrees with it or not, can
suppose this to be it. I hope you will come down upon it with all the
weight of your clear scientific intellect, your remarkable power of
exposition, and the authority of your name as a political economist.

I have done no work since our return but reading up arrears which had
accumulated during our absence, but I am going to work immediately upon
Mr Grote’s Aristotle for the Fortnightly.5 I have not yet seen the book,
and cannot foresee how far I shall be able to produce a generally useful
or interesting article upon it, but I mean to try.

Helen sends her kind regards to Mrs Cairnes, and I am

TO THOMAS SMITH1

Oct. 4. 1872

Dear Sir—

I have to acknowledge your letter of August 27 & to express through you
my thanks to the Nottingham branch of the International Edition:
current; Page: [1911] W.M.A. for the copies of their programme & of your
able pamphlet2 which they have done me the favour to send.

In the principles of the Association as set forth in the Programme3 I
find much that I warmly approve, & little, if anything from which I
positively dissent though, from the generality with which those
principles are laid down it is impossible for me to say to what extent I
should concur in the practical measures which the association would
propose in order to bring the principles into operation.

A remark however is suggested to me by some part of the phraseology both
of the programme & of the pamphlet, which I shd think it wrong to
withhold. What advantage is there in designating the doctrines of the
Assn by such a title as “the principles of the political & social
revolution”? “The Revolution” as a name for any set of principles or
opinions, is not English. A Revolution is a change of government
effected by force, whether it be by a popular revolt or by a military
usurpation, and as “the man” in English always means some particular
man, so “the Revolution” means some particular revolution, such as the
French Revolution, or the English revolution of 1688.

The meaning intended to be conveyed by “the principles of the
Revolution” can only be guessed at from a knowledge of French in which
language it seems to mean the political ideal of any person of
democratic opinions who happens to be using it. I cannot think that it
is good to adopt this mode of speech from the French. It proceeds from
an infirmity of the French mind which has been one main cause of the
miscarriages of the French nation in its pursuit of liberty & progress;
that of being led away by phrases & treating abstractions as if they
were realities which have a will & exert active power. Hitherto the
character of English thought has been different: it has required
propositions that express definite facts not vague words which only seem
to have a meaning. There is no real thing called “the Revolution”, nor
any “principles of the Revolution.” There are maxims which your Assn, in
my opinion rightly, consider to be essential to just government, and
there is a tendency, increasing as mankind advance in intelligence &
education, towards the adoption of the doctrines of just government.
Those are all the facts there are in the case, & the more clearly &
unambiguously these, & nothing but these are stated, the better people
will understand one another & the more distinctly they will see what
they are disputing about & what they are concerned Edition: current;
Page: [1912] to prove: When instead of this men range themselves under
banners as friends & enemies of “the Revolution,” the only important
question, what is just & useful, is kept out of sight, & measures are
judged not by their real worth but by the analogy they seem to have to
an irrelevant abstraction.

The otherwise very salutary intercourse which has grown up of late years
between portions of the English & French working classes will be dearly
paid for if it causes the advanced politicians of this country to
abandon one of the best characteristics of the English mind & replace it
by one of the worst of the French.

I cannot conclude without expressing the great pleasure with which I
have seen the full & thoroughgoing recognition by your body of the
claims of women to equal rights in every respect with men, & of
minorities, proportionally to their numbers, with majorities; & its
advocacy of the Federal principle for the security of this last. As a
further means to the same end, promoting at the same time other ends no
less valuable, I would invite the attention of your Association to the
importance of Proportional Representation.

Oct. 5. 1872

Dear Thornton—

Your letter of Sept. 22 found us here after the conclusion of perhaps
the most interesting & beautiful journey we ever made, the Greek journey
alone excepted. The tamest part was the return home through Switzerland,
from which you may imagine what the rest must have been. After leaving
Udine from which I last wrote to you, we went right across the Dolomite
country by the Ampezzo road, then round to Botzen taking the beautiful
valley of the Eisack & the Luson Alp district by the way: from Botzen to
the magnificent Stelvio pass, where we spent altogether six days,
descending to Bormio on the Italian side & climbing to the summit of the
Pressura mountain which surmounts the top of the pass. Helen I am happy
to say was able to climb the pass on foot from Träfoi (low down on the
Tyrol side) to the top & also to climb the Pressura without being worse
for the exertion. We had the most splendid weather conceivable while
near the Stelvio; but going on to the Arlberg pass we got into rainy
weather & we staid five days in that neighbourhood, of which only two
were fine. We then returned home across Switzerland & part of Savoy,
taking the opportunity of seeing Annecy & its lake which were new to us.
The journey has quite restored my Edition: current; Page: [1913] health
& has improved Helen’s though the improvement has not maintained itself
at the height it seemed to have reached at the Stelvio.

We were sorry that your holiday had so unpleasant an interruption2 but
glad that when resumed it was still pleasant.

I congratulate you on so nearly having finished your book.3 It is sure
to interest me whether I agree with it or not. I have not yet begun to
write on Mr Grote’s Aristotle,4 not having received the book, but I am
expecting it daily. In what I said about Lewes’s book5 I was purposely
guarded, having hardly any knowledge of my own respecting those works of
Aristotle to which it relates. I did not think it likely that any book
by Lewes would be profound either in philosophy or scholarship; but it
seemed to me on the whole a meritorious work; & this opinion was
confirmed by Mr Grote when I asked him what he thought of it. I cannot
doubt therefore that if you wish to read respecting Aristotle’s physical
writings, the book must be worth your reading.

I should like to have heard Louis Blanc expounding after his fashion the
political state of France.6 We think with him that the French peasantry
are becoming republican: but we do not think that it is in an
unintelligent way. Helen attributes it, I believe with reason, to the
great desire of the peasantry for thorough education, & their
perceptions from experience that lay schoolmasters teach better than
clerical. The Republicans being the only party who do not want to give
education into the hands of the priests, this, more than anything else,
is making the peasantry Republican.

Your letter addressed to Udine never reached me. But we should not have
been able to arrange a meeting in Italy, for in three days from the time
when I wrote to you from Udine, we left Italy by the Ampezzo road and
returned into Austria. It was well that we did not appoint a rendezvous
at Bozen, for the heat of that hot place was so great when we arrived,
that we only remained there two hours.

I will write to let you know where we shall be in the early part of next
year. At present we expect to be in England from about the middle of
February to the middle of April.

I thank you for sending me your little book on Aristotle’s various
meanings of ens.2 I find that it was well known to Mr. Grote, who refers
to it several times. He calls it in one place an “able treatise”, in
another an “instructive” one, and in a third he says that in your
“valuable chapter” (ch. 2) “the meanings of τὸ συμβεβηκός3 in Aristotle
are clearly set forth.”4 Unfortunately he did not live to reach that
part of the subject which corresponds to your book on the νου̑ ς

Dear Mr Robertson

We are glad to hear that there is no foundation for the rumours which
had reached us of a reconciliation between the two Committees,2 effected
at the general meeting of the members of the London Society.

I fully agree with you that it is most desirable that parliamentary
action should at present be abstained from; and my daughter has from the
first disapproved of the annual motion system, saying that it would
infallibly lead to a falling off of numbers in the votes. But I should
like to know what are the means by which you propose to “refuse to have
anything more to do with the Bill during the present Parliament,” and
“by abstaining bring” the Manchester people “to abstain from
parliamentary action.” The end is excellent, and I have no doubt you
will find good means of carrying it out, but I should like to know what
they are.

Edition: current; Page: [1916]
At present, propagandism is all that can usefully be attempted, and for
this purpose, lectures, if funds for the purpose can be obtained, are
most desirable. We are glad to hear that a new lady lecturer of promise
is available: who is she? It is a good plan to require a lecture to be
drawn up for your judgment. What is the ground of your dissatisfaction
with Mrs Ronniger?3

Dr Bennett4 has great influence at Greenwich, and a reputation as a
poet, I am told, among working men in general. He is not very zealous in
the cause, and were he to lecture, the advantage would rather be his
presenting the subject from the mild and commonplace point of view;
which is some advantage. He was willing to have lectured when my
daughter proposed it. Whether he would be willing now is another
question: but we think there would be no harm, but rather good, in
proposing it to him. [He was, we know privately, very much displeased
with Mrs Taylor, Mrs Pennington, et hoc genus omne; thinking them
unbusinesslike, fussy, rude, &c. &c. and being rather susceptible on the
question of his own dignity.]5

I will send the cheques for our annual subscriptions, if you will let me
know in whose name they are to be drawn. I should recommend your sending
round a printed form to subscribers, giving name and address for cheques
and post office orders. If this is omitted it will account for a great
falling off in the subscriptions. It would be as well perhaps to head it
with the name of the Society, and mine as that of the President, in
order that those who entered in any degree on my account may know that
yours is the real Simon Pure.

Dear Mr Robertson

We quite agree with you and Mr Hunter that the state of things which
seemed to us to counsel abstinence is greatly changed by the line taken
in the Tory papers.2 It is evident that the word has been given by
Disraeli, and we may now hope to see the bulk of the Tory party added to
the voters for the bill. If this happens, it will compel Gladstone
either to join too, or to bid for radical support by some other strong
measure. If it is likely that Mr Ward Hunt3 or any Conservative of
weight would be willing to undertake the bill, he should be invited to
do so. It can probably be ascertained through Mr Eastwick4 or otherwise,
by whom, either Conservative or Liberal, the Conservative leaders would
prefer to have the bill introduced; and the vast importance of their
cooperation will be so evident to all real friends of the cause, that
there would probably be little difficulty in getting the subject into
hands acceptable to them.

The time, moreover, is, I think now come when, at parliamentary
elections, a Conservative who will vote for women’s suffrage should be,
in general, preferred to a professed Liberal who will not. Of course
there may be reasons in particular cases for not acting on this rule;
but the bare fact of supporting Mr Gladstone in office, certainly does
not now give a man a claim to preference over one who will vote for the
most important of all political improvements now under public
discussion. I am

TO GEORGE CROOM ROBERTSON1

Avignon

Nov. 5. 1872

Dear Mr Robertson

You seem to us to underrate the value of “a pretty face”2 in a lecturer
on women’s rights. As my daughter says, it is not for the sake of effect
on men that it is important, but for the influence it has on the younger
women. It shews them that the championship of women’s cause is not
confined to women who have no qualifications for success in the more
beaten track, and that they would not, by joining in the movement,
forfeit their chance of the ordinary objects of women’s ambition. This
is an advantage which outweighs even some inferiority in lecturing
powers. It is above all on the minds of women that we ought to work, for
when the majority of them think the change right, it will come.

We have a strong impression that money is more usefully expended on
lectures in the provinces than in and about London. In London and the
suburbs nearly all who are likely to come to a lecture have at least
heard of the subject, and are already either favourable or hostile: but
in country places the lecturer often pierces into a quite fresh stratum
of public opinion. It is often found that before any lecture had been
delivered in a country town, nobody in the place had thought of the
subject one way or the other, but that many are willing and ready to
take the right view of it when presented to them. We should be sorry,
therefore, to see provincial lectures neglected in favour of London
ones. Indeed, our subscriptions to the former fund were made with the
express view of lectures in the provinces. The general subscription
arose out of my daughter’s offering £100 to Mrs Taylor for country
lectures.

There is much to be said for your idea of addressing Mr Jacob Bright
against the reintroduction of his bill next year; and I should much like
to see the sort of address you would think of sending, if you would put
it on paper in a rough way. It is important however not to include Mr
Eastwick in the same application with Mr Jacob Bright. You may remember
that Mr Eastwick said, last session, that he thought the parliamentary
conduct of the question should be placed in other hands. Any address,
public or private, should be made exclusively to Mr Jacob Bright. We
think that the great motive, and it is a powerful one, for making some
sort of an address to him, is in order that we may influence members who
are favourable to the suffrage, openly to stay away in considerable
numbers if Mr Jacob Bright insists on a Edition: current; Page: [1919]
division. This is the only way we can see of breaking the fall which is
sure to come: and if Mr Jacob Bright knows that your Committee
recommends this policy, it will be more likely than anything else to
check his folly, if anything would.

The decline of the annual subscriptions from £350 to £217 is less than I
should have expected, and not at all discouraging, when we consider, on
the one hand the general tendency of subscriptions to fall off somewhat
after the first year or two, through negligence or forgetfulness, and on
the other, the subscriptions likely to have been drawn off by the rival
Committee, and the general damp to the hopes of supporters by the
unfavourable division last summer.

Cher Monsieur—

J’ai lu vos articles dans la Revue des 2 Mondes des 1er juillet, 1er
août et 1er septembre.2 Votre esquisse de l’histoire de la propriété
territoriale, et votre description des différentes formes que cette
institution a revêtues à différentes époques, et dont la plupart se
conservent encore dans quelque endroit, me semblent très propres au but
que vous avez en vue et que je poursuis aussi depuis longtemps, celui de
faire voir que la propriété n’est pas chose fixe mais une institution
multiforme, qui a subi de grandes modifications, et qui est susceptible
d’en recevoir de nouvelles avec grand avantage. Vos trois articles
appellent et font désirer une quatrième qui traiterait de l’application
pratique de cette leçon à la société actuelle. C’est ce qu’on trouvera
sans doute dans votre livre.3

Quant à l’institution des Allmends,4 du moins comme elle existe à
présent, Edition: current; Page: [1920] vous en avez si peu dit dans vos
articles que je ne la connais jusqu’ici que par votre lettre. Il
faudrait en avoir bien étudié l’opération pour être en état de juger de
son applicabilité à l’Angleterre. Mais je ne crois pas qu’on puisse nier
que les réformes à faire dans l’institution de la propriété consistent
surtout à organiser quelque mode de propriété collective, en concurrence
avec la propriété individuelle. Reste le problème de la manière de gérer
cette propriété collective, et on ne peut trouver de meilleure manière
qu’en essayant celles qui se présentent ailleurs; peut-être même est-il
à désirer que plusieurs de ces modes existent ensemble, afin d’obtenir
les avantages de chacun et d’en compenser les désavantages. Il me semble
donc qu’à titre d’ expérience, le système des Allmends constitué de la
manière que vous proposez, pourrait être mis en pratique en Angleterre
avec avantage. Jusqu’ici, les hommes politiques de la classe ouvrière
anglaise ne se sont pas portés vers une pareille solution de la
question: ils préfèrent que la propriété collective soit affermée, soit
à des cultivateurs capitalistes, soit à des sociétés coopératives de
travailleurs. Ce dernier mode a été essayé avec succès, et il jouit déjà
d’une certaine faveur. La petite propriété, au contraire, n’a guère de
partisans que quelques économistes et quelques philanthropes: la classe
ouvrière paraît la repousser, comme une manière de multiplier le nombre
de ceux qui seraient intéressés à s’opposer à une nouvelle constitution
de la propriété territoriale. Pareil reproche ne peut guère s’adresser
au système des Allmends, et j’espère que ce système sera pleinement
exposé et discuté dans votre volume.

Je vois avec plaisir que vous prenez un peu l’habitude d’écrire pour
l’Angleterre; vous y trouverez un public beaucoup mieux préparé
qu’autrefois pour profiter de ce que vous avez à lui dire, et un penseur
belge est dans une position de haute impartialité à l’égard des choses
du continent d’Europe, qui le rend particulièrement propre à en donner
de saines appréciations à des lecteurs qui sont souvent réduits à croire
sur parole.

Dear Mr Robertson

Mrs Burbury’s objections to your proposal do not give me a high idea of
her judgment. I quite agree with you that Mrs Fawcett is so far from
being indispensable, that she is quite as detrimental as useful; and if
the policy of the Committee is to be in any degree regulated by a
reference to what she may do or think, I must at once retire from the
Committee and withdraw my name. Mrs Fawcett is an excellent woman, with
plenty of sense and energy but no experience, and a great deal of self
confidence; a person, therefore, admirably calculated to fall headlong
into mistakes. She never originated this movement, and is not likely to
originate any. She has neither a speculative nor an organizing
intelligence, and therefore, even supposing that she were twice her
present age, she is quite unfit to be a leader, though an excellent
guerilla partisan.2 You are, I believe, quite right in thinking that
neither her husband’s nor her sister’s3 opinion would guide her in the
least.

I also am of opinion that Mrs Burbury is mistaken in thinking that Mrs
Fawcett brings or guides any subscribers to the Society. We know that
she brought in none when the Society was founded, and have heard of no
names since brought in by her. I am afraid that if I speak frankly, it
may seem as though I overestimated my own influence, but I think, and I
have reason to believe that you agree with me in thinking, that the
Society which adheres to your Committee is kept together principally by
my name, and that, rightly or wrongly, the majority of those who go with
us in this matter, do so, in a great measure, in reliance on my opinion.
I feel bound, therefore, to justify their Edition: current; Page: [1922]
confidence to the best of my ability, by not allowing my name to be used
to back up anything I think foolish or mischievous, and cannot therefore
give my name to the Society unless my judgment, in things to which I
attach importance, is in some degree to be followed.

As regards the matter of addressing Mr Jacob Bright,4 I look upon it as
depending wholly upon how good an address to him can be got up: so that
I am very sorry you have not written down your idea to shew me. I
recommend discussing the matter among your trusted intimates, and
letting me see what you suggest, so as to have the address practically
prepared before suggesting the matter at all at a Committee meeting.

Dear Mr Robertson

Let me begin by expressing our sincere and hearty good wishes for the
happiness of yourself and your intended wife, and for the fulfilment of
all your hopes with regard to your married life.2

I shall be happy to see your draft address to Mr Jacob Bright as soon as
your other occupations allow of your preparing it, although I should
recommend Edition: current; Page: [1923] taking no steps in the matter,
even in regard to the Committee, until after we have Mrs Fawcett’s
scheme before us. Even if the parliamentary leadership were to pass into
other hands, it might still be desirable to discourage any parliamentary
action in the approaching session. With regard to Mrs Fawcett’s move, I
think we should in no way connect ourselves with it; nor make any
movement in that direction until we see what comes of Mrs Fawcett’s
move, and until we know into what hands it is proposed to transfer the
guidance.

We see no harm in your having consented to send a delegate to the
Birmingham Conference, as Mr Hunter has always been judicious.

With regard to Miss Wedgwood’s proposed publication,3 the thing in
itself would not be a bad thing, but all depends, in the first place on
what Miss Wedgwood would say, and in the next place on where it is
published: and it seems to me that supplying her with information should
be conditional on being allowed to see what she has said before it is
published, and on knowing where it is to be published.

therefore Edition: current; Page: [1924] more judicious, not to present
it even to our own Committee until after Mrs Fawcett’s proposal has been

think there should be no parliamentary action at all next year; and for
the members of the Committee who agree with me to say that they think so
too; but to listen to, and consider, Mrs Fawcett’s scheme and then
adjourn before voting on Mrs Fawcett’s. I am

Dear Mr Plummer

We have been in England for a hurried visit of a few weeks on business
since I last wrote to you, for my daughter has been suffering much from
severe headaches (brought on I believe by overwork) and this year we
spent the months we usually spend in England, in a town in the Austrian
Alps.2 The long rest has had the good effect upon my daughter’s health
which we hoped for, and we expect to be soon in England again, and hope
to have the pleasure of seeing you and Mrs Plummer again, with our other
English friends. But we will not be at Blackheath, for we have given up
our house Edition: current; Page: [1925] there, and have settled for the
present in Victoria Street, Westminster, which we hope will not prove
more inconvenient to you and Mrs Plummer than Blackheath was.

We are very glad to hear that both of you are in good health and that
you are in good and pleasant employment. We both beg to be kindly
remembered to Mrs Plummer and I am

Dec. 9. 1872

Dear Mr Cairnes

I am surprised to find how long it is since I last wrote to you, and
even since I received a very interesting letter from you, which is still
unacknowledged. The only excuse I can make, and it is a very
insufficient one, is the temptation there is to put off letter writing
whenever possible while one is occupied with other writing. I have now,
I am glad to say, finished an article on Grote’s Aristotle for the
Fortnightly;2 it is in the printer’s hands, and will appear in the
January number. I hope you are not expecting too much from it. Mr Grote
unfortunately, scarcely got further in his review of Aristotle than the
logical writings; he just made a beginning with the metaphysical; and I
have not touched, except in the most general way, upon any of
Aristotle’s writings not treated of by Mr Grote. The Ethics, Politics,
and Rhetoric would furnish matter for more than one interesting article,
which perhaps I might have been able to write after having once more
read them carefully through, but such matters would have had no
pertinence to the contents of Mr Grote’s book. The Physics, and for the
most part the Metaphysics, I only know at second hand. You therefore
will not find, what you seem to expect, a compendious account of all
Aristotle, like that which I attempted to give of all Plato. I can only
hope that I may have given a correct notion, as far as it goes, of what
Aristotle did for Logic in its different branches.

There are two questions connected with the application of Political
Economy, on which I should much like to compare notes with you. Have you
ever turned your attention to the merits and demerits of a tax on
property, Edition: current; Page: [1926] i.e. land and capital, realized
and unrealized, as a substitute for an income tax? The pros and cons are
tolerably obvious, the pros consisting rather in the demerits of other
direct taxes than in the recommendations of this. My attention has been
drawn to the subject by an Italian correspondent of mine, Costantino
Baer by name,3 a clever and sensible man, well versed in the best
English political economy, and who has published a little book
recommending, as the best system of taxation, a tax on land and capital,
of a percentage on their pecuniary value, combined with taxes on such
modes of expenditure as may be a fair test of a person’s general scale
of unproductive expenses. I have written, for the small print of the
Fortnightly, a short notice of this book,4 but I should much like to
have your opinion on its main position.

The other subject is that which has given rise to a controversy between
The Times and Fawcett,5—the expediency of requiring corporations and
endowed institutions to sell their lands and invest in the funds
instead. I suppose we are both agreed that bodies which are constituted
for the performance of other important duties, ought not to have their
time and thoughts diverted from them to the management of landed
estates. And it is perhaps not too soon to begin teaching this doctrine.
But I confess I should be sorry that the teaching should soon be
successful. It seems to me, that so long as it is certain that the
lands, if brought onto the market, would be almost all bought up and
added to the possessions of wealthy landed proprietors, or made the
foundation of new large private estates, it is better that they should
remain as they are; at least until the programme of the Land Tenure
Reform Association, or something like it, has become the creed of the
liberal party. Lands not yet appropriated by individuals should. I
think, by no means be allowed to pass into private ownership but should
be sacred to public purposes, and made a means of trying all promising
modes of collective management, with a view of testing the
practicability and the effects of these modes, and the capabilities of
collective management in general. It is well that there is such a
resource for experimental purposes without meddling at all with private
property in land, until the advantage of doing so has been completely
proved by sufficient trial.

I should like much to hear from you on these subjects, but only when it
is consistent with your comfort and your occupations to write: and
perhaps that may not be before I may have the pleasure of discussing
them with you viva voce, for we expect to be in England in the early
spring. I need hardly add that I should be glad to know how you are as
to health—both you and Edition: current; Page: [1927] your family. Our
own report in that respect is a good one. Helen’s health seems to be
steadily though slowly improving, and I am perfectly well. I am

As to a deputation, I have always disapproved of it, and disapproved of

judgment supposing it to proceed from any other Committee, I should wish
to retire from the London Committee if it decides upon a deputation.

As to a private communication I think it a complete mistake to shew
Gladstone our cards. I do not think this an occasion when a private
communication with Mr Gladstone would be judicious, and even were it one
I should not like to make a private communication with Mr Gladstone from
a Committee of which I am the nominal head, unless through some members

Dear Sir

I am sorry to hear of your nervous headache, and of the troubles caused
Edition: current; Page: [1928] you by the attempt to raise a religious
cry against you.2 Notwithstanding the progress of religious toleration,
which even in my own country is surprisingly great, such appeals to
prejudice are to be expected by any really free and rigorous [vigorous?]
thinker; but when they do not prevent him from being listened to, nor
cripple him in his means of subsistence, neither of which effects has
fortunately been produced in your case, he has no need to mind them.

I am obliged to you for communicating to me in so clear a manner your
new ideas on the mental operation of judgment.3 I have been much
interested by them, and I think I can briefly express my opinion of them
in three points, in two of which I agree with you, while in a third I
differ.

1. I agree with you that Belief is the essential constituent in a
Differentia of judgment, and that the putting together of two ideas is
merely a prerequisite or antecedent condition.

2. I cannot, however, think that one idea is a sufficient prerequisite
for a judgment. I cannot see how there can be Belief without both a
subject and a predicate. If you say that the idea of an elephant
suffices for belief in an elephant, belief in an elephant can only mean
belief that there is such a thing as an elephant—that an elephant
exists: or, in other words, that under some circumstances, and in some
place known or unknown, I should perceive by my senses a thing answering
the definition of an elephant. Now this, which is the truth really
believed, is a fact, in two terms, not in one only. Existence, that is
capacity, in some circumstances really to be found in Nature, of being
seen or felt, is a real conception [or?] Idea and a real predicate. I
therefore Edition: current; Page: [1929] do not think that your
modification of the received theory of judgment is sustainable. But,

3. Your practical alterations in the rules of the syllogism do not
depend on that modification of the theory.

I have pointed out that propositions of all predicates, and of all
quantities and qualities, may be transformed into exactly equivalent
propositions, either affirmative or negative, with exist for their sole
predicate. If this transformation (like the reductions, ostensive and
per impossible, of the common logic) enables the syllogistic rules to be
simplified, or further generalized, it is legitimate and desirable to do
so; and though I doubt if the altered form and rules will or ought to
supersede the old ones (the syllogistic logic being especially intended
to guard against the fallacious use of the common forms of language) yet
they may very usefully exist side by side with the old and afford an
additional test of the correctness of reasoning, or more properly
speaking, a different mode of applying the same test.

My article on Grote’s Aristotle is in the printer’s hands, and will be
published in the Fortnightly Review on the 1st of next month.4 I have
had an opportunity of making honourable mention of both the treatises
which you did me the favour to send. If I do not hear from you to the
contrary, I will address it to Aschaffenburg as usual.

Dear Hajji—

The last time I saw Mr Gregson he expressed, without any suggestion from
me, a very decided opinion that your marriage settlement, & the
certificates of the securities in which the money is invested ought not,
as a matter of business to be in the custody of one of the trustees, but
shd be deposited in a solicitor’s office. I have felt some hesitation in
proposing to you that this opinion shd be acted upon because the
proposal might seem to imply a distrust which we certainly do not feel,
in Mr Gurney;2 but in matters of business it is most right to act on
business principles, such as experience has led people of business to
adopt, as being on the whole, & in the long run best. It seems to me
that the person who shd have the custody of the [deed ?] and securities
is Mr Gregson himself, as the settlement was drawn up by him, as he is
the solicitor of two of the three trustees, and also of yourself who
stand first in order as cestui que trust;3 Pray let me know what you
think of this. If you agree with me perhaps you would not mind
communicating the opinion to Mr Gurney.

Monsieur—

J’ai attendu pour répondre à votre lettre du 26 Septembre, jusqu’à ce
que j’aie eu le temps d’écrire un petit article sur “L’Avere et
L’Imposta”2 dans lequel, en rendant compte du livre de manière à en
faire ressortir ma haute appréciation, j’exprime mon dissentiment sur le
point en Edition: current; Page: [1932] discussion entre nous deux, mais
en reduisant ce dissentiment à ses justes limites. Quand cet article
aura paru dans le Fortnightly Review, (ce qui sera probablement au 1er
février) je me donnerai le plaisir de vous en envoyer un exemplaire.

Les arguments que vous ajoutez dans votre dernière lettre à ceux qui se
trouvent dans le livre, sont des argumenta ad hominem, se fondant sur
une assimilation de l’impôt sur le capital à d’autres impôts que
j’approuve, notamment aux impôts sur les landlords et à celui des
successeurs. Il est vrai que j’approuve ces impôts-là mais en avouant
qu’ils sont contraires au principe financier de l’égalité. Quant aux
impôts sur la terre il me paraît juste (et je vois avec plaisir que vous
êtes de la même opinion) de retenir pour l’état le tout ou une partie de
l’acroissement de la rente qui a lieu par des causes naturelles ou
sociales indépendantes du travail ou des frais du propriétaire tandis
que l’intérêt du capital tend plutôt à baisser. Et quant aux
successions, je ne reconnais aux héritiers mêmes directs aucun droit
moral à hériter au delà d’une légitime suffisante pour leur donner de
bonnes chances dans la vie. Donc si la société permet d’hériter par delà
cette limite, elle a le droit d’y mettre les conditions qu’elle veut; et
elle peut user de ce droit dans le but de modérer l’inégalité de
richesses ce qui est moins permis lorsqu’il s’agit d’ôter aux
travailleurs leurs propres gains. Par là vous verrez qu’au moins je ne
suis pas en contradiction avec mes propres principles.

Dear Mr Cairnes

I thank you heartily for the way in which you have entered, in your last
letter, into the two economical questions on which I asked your
opinion.2 On that which relates to the lands of endowed institutions I
am happy to find that we are entirely agreed, and am glad to hear also
that Mr Courtney is on our side of the question. If you see the
Examiner, you will find in it next week an article with my signature in
which our opinion on this point, and the grounds of it, are fully
entered into.3 Both my daughter and I are occasionally sending articles
to the Examiner, having been much solicited thereto Edition: current;
Page: [1933] by the proprietor Mr Bourne,4 and having reason to think
that he is really desirous of making the paper an organ of opinion
allied to our own.

On the other question, that of a tax on capital, I have also been
writing, in the form of a short review of Mr Baer’s book for the small
print of the Fortnightly,5 of which I hope you will approve. I have
urged against the proposed tax, the same objection which you make to it,
though it is open to that objection in a somewhat less degree than you
surmise: for, in the first place, Baer does propose that the plant and
raw material of a manufacturer, in short all accumulated property
whatever, should be subject to the tax. And to the objection that the
professional classes would be spared, Baer would answer, that as a tax
proportional to the value of every capital would only fall on that
portion of the income from it which is pure interest, the capitalist
would enjoy the same exemption as the professional man in so far as his
situation is similar, that is, in virtue of as much of his income as is
the result of his personal exertions and skill. The grand objection
which remains unaffected is, that Savings would be taxed doubly and
spendings only singly. I have condemned the tax as unjust, but have said
that considering the very strong objections to an income tax, a country
may possibly have at some time or other to make its election for a
moderate tax on capital and land as being on the whole the course of
least injustice. This is the only point on which I am not confident that
you will agree with me.

I look forward to seeing you as soon as possible after we arrive in
England, and I hope to find you, if not better, at least not worse than
when you wrote.

Dear Sir

I thank you for your further elucidations of the point on which we
differ.2 You did not, however, as you seem to suppose, fail to convince
me of the invariable convertibility of all categorical affirmative
propositions into predications of existence. The suggestion was new to
me, but I at once saw its truth when pointed out. It is not on that
point that our difference hinges, as you will see by the remark I will
now make on the new examples you have given.3

In the first of the three, “A Centaur is a fiction of the poets,” the
subject of the proposition when transformed in the manner you pointed
out, is ex professo something merely imaginary; and therefore, as you
justly observe, the proposition does not assert that under any
conditions actually existing Edition: current; Page: [1935] in Nature,
it would be seen or felt. What this proves, however, is only that I, at
least in terms, gave a too narrow definition of existence; expressing
myself as if nothing existed but what is perceived by the external
senses. You will not deny that a mere mental conception exists; and
therefore a proposition which asserts that a fiction of the poets,
answering to what we mean by a centaur, is, asserts this kind of
existence. If no such mental conception had ever existed in the minds of
poets, that is if a centaur, as a mental conception, had not existed,
the proposition would have been false. Consequently the proposition does
assert existence. And this holds, in whatever manner we define
existence, provided we consider it to mean anything at all, and not to
be (as Hegel says)4 identical with nothing.

Again, you instance the proposition “There are laws of nature,” or “Laws
of nature are.” Laws of nature, you say, cannot be seen or felt.
Certainly not as abstractions; but then, abstractions as such cannot be
said to be, even in the mind. Law of nature is, as I understand it,
simply an invariable order among phenomena: those phenomena can be seen
and felt, either in external or internal consciousness: and if we see or
feel the facts, we see or feel the order of the facts. When we see two
facts succeed one another, we see their succession, which is as much as
to say, we see them successively; for succession in any other sense than
that, is nothing but a word.

You perceive, therefore, that you have not convinced me; but there is
always instructiveness in such discussions, and I shall be very glad
when I can see your idea worked out to its consequences in the
improvement of the rules of syllogistic logic.

With many thanks for the kind and flattering expressions in your letter,
and for the feelings of which they are the indication, I am

Dear Sir—

I beg to acknowledge your letter of Jan. 8. I sympathize strongly with
the desire to render the revenues of the Universities more conducive
Edition: current; Page: [1937] than they as yet are to the purposes for
which Universities do or ought to exist, & I agree with you & your
associates in thinking it a great defect in the mode of disposing of
those revenues that no part of them is employed in making the
Universities places for the advancement of knowledge while so very large
a part is expended in giving incomes as rewards for the mere acquisition
of knowledge unaccompanied with any obligation for extending it, for
teaching it, or even for keeping it up. What would be the best system to
adopt for the correction of this defect is a question which I am happy
to see discussed & which will probably require much discussion, but in
the meanwhile I see very strong objections to some of the proposals
mentioned in your letter. The abolition of the competitive examination
for fellowships seems to me the reverse of an improvement. I quite
understand that the object of this proposal is to prevent the
appointments from being obtained by cramming. But it is not beyond the
capacity of the Universities to take sufficient security that success in
the examinations shall not depend on cram; nor is it understood that the
high honours at either Cambridge or Oxford are generally so obtained. On
the other hand I have the greatest distrust of all schemes for disposing
of high & well paid employments by a nominating body. Such bodies,
having only a collective responsibility, are often even more addicted to
abusing their patronage than single functionaries; the members are apt
to job for one another, & vote for each other’s protégées. And even
without the supposition of jobbing, a body like that which you have in
view composed indeed of scientific persons but of persons whose position
& reputation are already made, is not at all likely to look with favour
on the striking out of new paths. Experience shows that Academies
whether of literature or science generally prefer inoffensive
mediocrities to men of original genius. Cuvier2 was no ordinary man but
neither Geoffroy St-Hilaire3 nor Darwin would have had a chance of
obtaining his vote for a professorship. As a precise knowledge of what
is already known is now an indispensable requisite for carrying
knowledge farther, it seems to me necessary to retain a very strict
competitive examination as the first condition for a fellowship. This
would be no hindrance to requiring as an additional condition that the
candidate should shew or have shewn, by some original investigation,
that he has powers which are worth securing either for teaching or for
the advancement of science. Indeed even the nominating body, if it did
its duty would I think be obliged to institute some kind of competitive
examination in order to ensure the possession of a sufficient quantity

The terms of the circular, which indicate the object you have in view
without committing you to any particular plan, I have no fault to find
with; & I agree in the main with the Resolutions passed at the
Freemasons’ Tavern, except that it appears to me desirable that the
posts created for the prosecution of original research shd generally or
always have some amount of teaching duties also annexed to them. But
even if I were much more confident than I am that my views would be in
accordance with those of the majority of the Association, I would rather
not become a member, unless I were able, which I am not, to take part in

Dear Mr Robertson

I have been delaying my reply to your last letter, expecting to have
been in London before this, and to have been able to discuss the subject
of it with you viva voce. I am still not sure when we shall be in
London, but our arrival cannot now be very long delayed; and I think I
shall be better able to form a judgment a little time hence, than at
present. I think it very likely that it may be well for some sort of
communication to be entered into with the Conservatives,2 but probably
it may be better to do it, at least at first, through individuals, and
not formally from the Committee. On these points we shall hope to be
able to consult with you when we are in town.

If you should have occasion to write again before hearing from me,

Dear Mary—

I will lend the money for Henry,2 but it must be on one condition—that I
have clear evidence that Mr Willcox3 knows of Henry’s having taken money
at Mr Hill’s. The evidence I shd require is either to have it in writing
from Mr Willcox, or from Stuart that he himself has spoken of it to Mr
Willcox. Of course to this I must add that the money must be repaid to
Mr Hill, as even if he is willing that it shd not be, that would be a
disgrace to the family. I think Mr Colman4 quite right in insisting that
Stuart shd not take Henry, & I am very glad that he has done so.

frequent oral discussions with him: of written ones I know nothing.
Cooperation had then only been proposed in the form of Owen’s completely
Communistic Associations. These my father thought could not succeed but
he always said that they were entitled to a fair and complete trial.
Cooperation in the Rochdale form he would, I have no doubt, have
approved of and welcomed.

is difficult to get an article which demands complete justice for women

committed to the subject, and it is not there that such a paper is
required; moreover those publications have generally their own writers,

My dear Sir

I think that you have excelled yourself in this Essay, it conveys, to me
at least, a clearer notion of what the System is, than I had before
acquired; and, (what is a great advantage) you have expounded the
Science analytically Edition: current; Page: [1955] beginning with
things as they appear, and proceeding gradually from the mental
operations of which we are all conscious—to the discovery of those laws
by which the philosopher finds them to be regulated. I think the part
which treats of Sense to be executed in a very masterly manner; that of
Understanding extremely good, though, not to my mind equally striking
with the former. As to the Essay if my opinion is asked, I can only say
that I think the execution extremely good.

My dear Sir

This note will be delivered to you by Mr E. Chadwick,2 one of my most
particular friends, who is desirous of contributing to the London
Review,3 and who I am satisfied, would be on certain subjects a most
valuable collaborateur. He has been a writer in the Westminster Review,4
but has seceded, like the rest of us, in consequence of the recent
changes in that work.5 He had collected materials for an article on the
London Police,6 a subject on which few people have thought more, or had
greater opportunities of knowledge, and I believe that he would be glad
to complete an article on that subject for the London Review if it be
not preoccupied by some other contributor.

I have perused the “Account of the Philosophy of Kant”,2 in manuscript,
several times with attention, and am very grateful for the very large
stock of information which I have derived from it. All the more
elementary principles of Kant’s Philosophy, so far as I am acquainted
with them, appear to me very forcibly stated and aptly illustrated in
this “Treatise.”—The exposition is less technical and more familiar than
any of the writings of Kant’s followers which are known to me, and the
arguments by which the various doctrines are supported are stated in
this treatise in a manner not only likely to convince, but which, it
seems to me, ought to convince, many of those who have been trained up
in the existing Systems of Metaphysics. I have no hesitation in
declaring my firm conviction, founded on no small degree of
consideration and reflection,—That if the “Table of the Elements of the
Mind” have no archetype in the impressions derived from our
senses,—there is no point at which a consistent and consecutive thinker
can stop—short of the “Kantesian Philosophy”. And this will I think, be
more clearly perceived, in proportion as that philosophy is better
known, and more carefully studied—to which end the publication of this
little treatise would in my opinion greatly contribute.

of the 18th which (by the way) appears to have been written under the
idea that my father and myself are one and the same person.

Since you have thought my article2 worthy of insertion it is very
probable that I may place another or others at your disposal, though I
cannot tell how soon, my other occupations seldom allowing me time for
any contribution to a periodical work beyond the dimensions of a
newspaper article. This will prevent me from undertaking to write either
on the subject which you are so kind to suggest or on any other. I have
written nothing in any review or magazine for the last four years,
except the paper which you have done me the honour to insert.—Before
that time I was a frequent contributor to the Westminster Review from
its commencement.

I have heard with great pleasure from my friend Mr Roebuck, that your
Magazine has met with great success, especially in the North.

I remain
 Sir,
 very truly yours

My dear Sir

I have been very negligent in answering your letters, and I have not for
a long time sent you any communications for your Magazine. The reason
was that all my spare time has been taken up in writing various things
for the Monthly Repository,2 which, though a work of much smaller
circulation, seemed to me to need any assistance which I could give it,
more than yours did. The two Magazines stand in each other’s way,
however, for they are exactly of the same principles and each withdraws
contributors from the other. I wish a junction were possible, but I do
not see how it is to be effected.

In case I should have time to write something for you, what kind of
article should you prefer?

I am going to take the liberty of sending a parcel of books to our
friend Mr Nichol3 through you. I should have sent it by the packet to
Montrose direct, but that it contains some books which I cannot easily
replace.

Edition: current; Page: [1959]
The aspect of politics here is encouraging. Both the Ministry and the
House have improved exceedingly in spirit since the late changes, & the
decided breach with the Conservatives. This is not only my own opinion,
but Roebuck’s, who has hitherto thought much worse of them than I have.
The collision with the Lords will certainly come next year. Our object
should be to hearten up the popular portion of the ministry to go
through it confidently.

Yours ever

J. S. Mill

Nothing could give the conductors of the “London Review” greater
pleasure than that you should undertake all the subjects wh you have
been so kind as to mention. The “2nd Travels”2 would best suit the
present No. [3The article on “Young’s Lectures” in the first No4 he
agrees with me in condemning as “paltry” in its attack on the
“association metaphysics”, & not worth answering; it got in only through
the imprudent promise of the editors to the writer. But a review of
Young’s book on its merits, without notice of the article, wd give the
opportunity of presenting the doctrine in its true light. For this] your
paper on Priestley5 shows how eminently you are qualified. The last 2
pages of the concluding paper made an impression upon me which will
never be effaced. In a subsequent paper of my own in the “Repository”,
headed “the 2 kinds of poetry” (Oct. 1833)6 I attempted to follow out
your speculation into some of those ulterior consequences wh you had
rather indicated than stated. [J.S.M. expresses his agreement with me
respecting a Edition: current; Page: [1962] Church Establishment, for
reasons which he proceeds to state. He is persuaded that the young
clergy are quite prepared to go with Coleridge in his posthumous essay
against the doctrine of the plenary inspiration of the Bible.7 If I
review the “2nd Travels”,8 Mr White will probably undertake to review
the “Remains of Knox” in his correspondence with Jebb, bishop of
Limerick.9 J.S.M. is much gratified by my appreciation of his paper on
Sedgwick10 in the first No; wh however presents only ½ of his view of
the empirical metaphysics.]

My dear Sir

The parties connected with the management of the London & Westminster
Review are always glad to receive the freest remarks from all parties &
especially from their subscribers. Mr Brown2 need be under no
apprehension that such sentiments as those relating to Prayer in No 2 of
the London Review3 Edition: current; Page: [1963] will be promulgated in
the London & Westminster. The writer, using the latitude given by the
plan of the London Review, expressed his individual sentiments, not
those of the conductors of the review, & if the author had not been a
very important contributor whom it was necessary for the review to
stretch a point for, the editors would have required the suppression of
those passages. The plan of the review hereafter will be to avoid
controversy on points of religious belief—one point excepted which may
perhaps be considered such by some persons but which it is impossible
for the conductors of the review to waive their solemn convictions—they
cannot forbear to contend that man is not responsible for his belief,
but only for using his best endeavours to arrive at a true one. This, &
the principle that it is not the opinions arrived at, but the spirit in
which these opinions are sought & held, which alone procures acquittal
at the divine tribunal—these principles, which involve the condemnation
of all exclusiveness & sectarianism in religion as well as in
philosophy, the L. & W. Review will maintain with the utmost earnestness
& energy—but it will avoid the expression of any opinion on points of
doctrine, & it expects to draw its contributors from persons of every
religious belief who hold that belief in a truly catholic spirit.

I hope these explanations will be satisfactory to Mr Brown, & you are at
liberty to communicate their substance to any person who may entertain
the same feelings with this gentleman. I have not been authorized by the
editor4 to say this, but I speak from a perfect knowledge of his
sentiments & those of the proprietor5 & you are aware that my own
influence with the review is considerable.6

I retain Mr Brown’s letter to shew to all whom it may concern.

Ever yours

It is intended to have in the next number of the London & Westminster
Review, an article on the present state of affairs in the north of
Spain—of a mixed character, political & military, or I may rather say,
political & personal—discussing, first, the question of the foreign
policy of our ministers, & the general question of interference in the
cause of free institutions abroad—this, which requires only a few pages,
I am going to write myself2—but it is also extremely important that the
prospects of the war itself, & the imputations which have been made upon
the conduct of the Legion & of its commander,3 should be discussed, &
for that purpose a good military critic is requisite. I need not say to
whom, in such a case, I should most desire to address myself—but though
I dare not go farther, in reference to yourself, than to say that
nothing could exceed the service it would be to our review if you could
be induced to undertake it—I venture to beg that if you cannot do so,
you will be so kind as to favour us with your advice as to the quarter
to which, next to yourself, it would be most desirable to apply—

writer (himself a German) was probably misled by rumour prevalent in

his statements. J.S.M. is not surprised that from the continued
non-appearance of my paper4 I conclude that it is not cared for; but
assures me that it is not so, but the omission arises merely from the
need of consulting variety in the cast of the subjects in each No. It
will appear in the next. If I like to deal (as I had suggested) with
Phrenology5 the article will be sure of acceptance for the next No.

Dear Grant—

I have just arrived here & found three letters from you, which are the
only ones (except the one to Geneva & one from Naples) that I have
received. The one to Geneva I found on my return from Italy, the post
office having neglected to forward it according to my written
instructions. Thanks for all the kindness of your letters & for the very
great trouble you have had in a thousand and one ways about my
affairs—you never think you can do enough for your friends. Those may
think themselves very lucky whom you consider such for everything they
would wish done is sure to be done for them with more zeal & energy than
they would do it for themselves—& you never expect them to do anything
for you in return—in addition to all this trouble you have lost your
holidays which your own health so much needed, by my illness &
absence—but it shall be repaid you twofold if ever I have the power.—As
for my health, my head is much the same as before, that is, sometimes
better sometimes worse; but there is hardly anything wrong now in my
general health, & I am as strong as ever, so that it is evidently a mere
local derangement, which may remain as it is for a long time, or may go
off very soon—whatever it is, nothing I do seems to affect it, so there
is no use in treating myself as an invalid & I do not mean to do so any
longer. I shall live temperately, take a great deal of exercise, & avoid
anything which I find by experience to be injurious—& so have it to
itself. Pray give my best Edition: current; Page: [1967] respects to the
chairs—tell them I thank them most heartily for their kindness in
prolonging my leave of absence but that in this severe weather I do not
think any more travelling would be useful to me—rather the contrary. I
should prefer returning to my work & if it does not make me worse I feel
quite capable of performing it—before next spring the experiment will
have been fairly tried & if either then or before it should be evidently
better for me to take another interval of absence, I will ask for it.
For the present I mean to stay a few days here as I am at liberty to do
so & nothing appears urgently to require my presence—& perhaps by
staying I may have better weather for crossing. Pray if you have time &
you are not at last fairly tired out, write again—& if Falconer has not
written (there is no letter from him here) ask him to write to me about
the review. I shall see the number which has come out in my absence,
tomorrow at Bennis’s. I did not get either of your letters which
contained something from Falconer, nor what I regret much more, the
little word from Carlyle, & the Naples people though they sent with my
letters twice as many more which were not for me, did not send Graham’s,
so I have had no letters at all except from you & from Kensington, but
you have told me so fully what everybody is about, that I cannot have
lost much. The only person you tell me nothing about is yourself—what
are you doing? have you removed to Hickson’s yet? have you ever time to
read or write or walk or do any one thing whatever that is pleasant? are
you no better? well I am sorry to see you are not—& I should wonder if
you were, being so overworked. Mr Peacock2 & Mr Hill3 too seem to have
lost their holidays by my absence—but as Mr Peacock likes to take his at
this season I hope he will still have them.

This journey will give us plenty to talk about in our winter walks—I
have a store of pleasant things to tell of—but I cannot do it now—so
good bye—

Dear Molesworth—

I have no time to write at much length at present—but I will do all that
you ask me to do. As to your question, what is the least Edition:
current; Page: [1968] that we should require of the Whigs;2 this I think
is the least, & also the most: 1. that all the questions which interest
the Radicals as Radicals, shall be open questions: the Ballot, Triennial
Parliaments, Household Suffrage, Reform of the Lords, the Corn Laws,
Church rates, Electoral districts, abolition of the
qualification—perhaps you may be able to add others. 2. that umbrage
shall not be taken at our opposing their measures when bad (as the
English Church Bill)3 or moving radical amendments to them; e.g. the
destruction of the Irish Church,4 in lieu of the appropriation clause.
3. that they shall support our candidates, as well as require us to
support theirs; & specially that when a Whig & a Radical candidate or
candidates come into competition, the one who has the stronger party or
is most likely to succeed, (as far as that can be ascertained) shall be
put forward & the other or others shall not only retire, but use their
most strenuous exertions in his favour. Less than all this, ought not to
satisfy us, & more we ought not to ask; because if all this be granted,
we retain every advantage that we should have if unconnected with the
Whigs, & as our support of them involves no sacrifice they are entitled
to it at all events, so long as they are even a shade better than the
Tories.

I take it as a great compliment that you modify what you write in
compliance with my suggestions though you do not agree with them. With
regard to Fonblanque,5 I have stuck in a note, complimenting him on his
services & good intentions & gently remonstrating with him for
quarrelling with us. You will see whether you are willing to father it
or not. With respect to Howick6—I Edition: current; Page: [1969] know
nothing of him personally, but various things in his public conduct have
at different times made me think better of him than you do—his voting
against the Corn laws &c. & I know positively, though I have never said
it to any person but yourself (& it should not be repeated) that more
than a year before he proposed in the Cabinet an organic reform in the
Lords, & wrote a long paper on the subject. My informant is Senior,7 to
whom he shewed the paper. Now I doubt if any other member of the Cabinet
would have done this or if any one of them supported him in the
proposition.—I have a great respect also for Parnell,8 & I believe he is
moving heaven & earth to have the points of difference made open
questions.

I have stolen in the last two days, time to begin a little article for
the review9 & a day or two more will finish it.

Give my respects to Leader10—an auspicious name in political
partisanship.

Ever yours

My dear Taylor

It has occurred to me since our conversation about Macaulay, that you
might like to see a specimen of his statesmanship in India.2 I therefore
send Edition: current; Page: [1970] you a draft of a despatch to India,
prepared by myself, on one of his measures.3 The authorities at this
house went entirely with me, but Hobhouse4 would not: the thing dropped,
& nothing has been written to India on the subject at all.

Do not think that a style so controversial as that of this paper is what
I think desirable or what I generally practise in official
correspondence; it is by no means so—but this paper was written in ill
health, in the domestic distress of last year, & I may add, against
time, having to be written before I could get away, to go abroad for my
health:5 I left it in hands quite capable of moderating the tone, &
altering what seems polemical in its character; & we often find it
necessary to write our despatches first for effect here, upon the
Directors & the India Board, & afterwards shape them into something more
suitable to the dignity of official authority exercised over gentlemen
by gentlemen.

In any case you will sympathize in the annoyance of one having for
years, (contrary to the instincts of his own nature, which are all for
rapid change) assisted in nurturing & raising up a system of cautious &
deliberate measures for a great public end, & having been rewarded with
a success quite beyond expectation, finds them upset in a week by a
coxcombical dilettante litterateur who never did a thing for a practical
object in his life.

You might well be surprised at my not having acknowledged the receipt of
your most interesting & valuable letter, your kindness in writing which
in such circumstances as you did merited certainly the warmest thanks—&
it was not from want of a proper sense of that kindness, that I put off

more than could be said in a hurry. I have been a mere drudge all this

It was a fatal objection to Col. Shaw as the writer of the article we

the aid of your extreme kindness in giving us your opinion on the
principal points in the conduct of the campaign—an opinion which we
value much more than that of Col. Shaw or any one else—we are enabled to
dispense with other military criticism & having selected the man who we

you will, if time permits, allow us to send you the article in MS or in
type, look through it, & strike out anything that appears to you
erroneous or objectionable—if you would add anything, of course it would

The London & Westminster Review ought to have a masterly article on the
D. of Wellington’s Despatches, published by Colonel Gurwood.2 No one
living could do such justice to the subject as yourself3—& we could give
you any latitude as to space & time—except that if possible it would be
desirable to anticipate the Quarterly4 as to some portion or other of
the book, in order that the extracts may be fresh. It would be a credit
to the whole radical party to speak of Wellington in the review as you
would speak of him, shewing ourselves at the same time capable of
sitting in judgment on him—& the article would establish for us a
reputation for first rate military articles

If your health be not a hindrance which I most fervently hope it will

TO SIR WILLIAM MOLESWORTH1

India House

29th August 1837

My dear Molesworth

It is impossible to be surprised, & quite out of the question to find
any fault with your not being willing to go on year after year expending
money on a concern which it was quite voluntary on your part to spend
anything upon, Edition: current; Page: [1974] & which has cost you, as
you truly say, already much more than you at first intended.2 It has
been a great satisfaction to me all along, & is especially so now, to
reflect that I had no hand whatever in inducing you to start the London
Review, except by not refusing a most unexpected offer when
spontaneously made by you to me, & that though I did advise you to buy
the Westr., I never advised you to pay so much for it. I should have
been much mortified if I had induced you to stake so much money on your
confidence in me, & then not succeeded—& the responsibility I have not
incurred with you, I am determined never to incur with anyone else. I
shall ask nobody to sink any more money in the Review.

I have now one question to ask, which I hope you will answer as frankly
as I put it: Do you really wish to carry on the review till next April?
I do not consider you at all bound to do so: neither I should think does
Robertson:3 for as his plan has not yet had anything like a trial, he
could sustain no injury in anybody’s opinion by its abandonment now.
Therefore if you would prefer giving up the review now, that is
immediately after the appearance of the forthcoming number (which
Hooper,4 Dilke,5 & others advise us to announce for the end of October,
not the 1st) it had better be done then.

But if you are disposed to try three more numbers, instead of one more,
& so terminate Robertson’s year, what I intend to do is this. If by that
time we can reduce the annual deficit sufficiently, to enable me with
any prudence to carry on the review at my own expense, I will do so. In
that case, I shall certainly not avail myself of your willingness to
abandon what you have already expended, but shall consider you as a
shareholder to the extent of the whole amount, & the only change I shall
make is, to credit myself with £500 a year for my time & trouble
(hitherto unremunerated) ever since the review was started, &
prospectively too, as well as with all sums I may have to advance, &
nearly £300 which I am already in advance. This I think will be fair if
I take upon myself the future expenses.

If the sale should not in April have improved sufficiently to render
this course on my part consistent with prudence I shall then offer the
review to Dilke, or to whatever person will give you the greatest price
for it, & guarantee its being carried on upon radical principles. So
much we owe to the radical cause, which must not if we can help it
suffer the discredit of being unable Edition: current; Page: [1975] to
support an old established organ. I shall in that case withdraw entirely
from all connexion with the review. It will be commonplace radical,
which is all that the bulk of the supporters of our review require; &
our particular section of the radicals must in that case renounce the
pretension it has had ever since the Westminster started, of being the
leading section: a position which I do not think it has any right to, by
its numbers, or even its talents, for there are not above half a dozen
men of talent in it, but solely by its having definite principles, which
no other section of radicals except the Owenites have.

I differ from most of the sentiments you express about the review, but I
am not much surprised that you should express them. The good articles
(except your own)6 in the last number were literary,7 not political or
metaphysical, & literary articles are not to your taste, as you admit. I
do not believe however that you will find anybody, except Grote &
Roebuck, thinks the number destitute of merit. Such as it is, it is not
(nor can any single number be) a specimen of the new system, for the
principle of that is, above all, variety. We wished this number to be
chiefly literary because the time of year was unfavorable to politics, &
because it was desirable at first to overdo the change of character of
the review, in order that people might see there was a change—which they
never do unless it is perked in their faces. Those who liked us as we
were before probably do not think this a good number, but I am persuaded
that everybody else thinks it is a great improvement on our former ones.
The next number, & perhaps the next after that will be much more
political, as well as much more solid (though I hope equally readable) &
may therefore be more to your taste. However that is a secondary
question as you have such strong reasons, independent of the mode of
management, for intending to give it up.

Neither do I agree with you in thinking the subject of the succession, &
the King of Hanover, a bad one. It will be bad if badly treated, & if
Robertson’s article is not good it shall not be inserted.8 If that
subject is bad, your subject of Orange Lodges9 was bad. Both seem to me
to be legitimate engines Edition: current; Page: [1976] of party
warfare. The editorial errors you speak of must be those (very bad to be
sure) in a portion of the article on Spain, which I wrote myself.10
These errors remained uncorrected, or rather were miscorrected because
the proof came to my house when I was out of town & so was printed off
before I saw it. This was not Robertson’s fault, & I will take care it
shall not happen again. Some such errors are inevitable when articles
come in late, but I shall take care they do not happen frequently.

The elections11 proved to me nothing except the decline of enthusiasm, &
the certain victory of the Tories at the next general election if we
have not the ballot. But it is evident to me from all signs, that the
people of England are moderate radical. There are a great many new
radical members, but they are all of the moderate-radical kind; & it is
evident to me that the reformers generally disapprove of attacks on the
ministry. Whenever there is a vacancy, whom do they talk of bringing
forward? Whether it is Kilkenny, Lambeth, or Dumfriesshire, it is
Ewart,12 not Roebuck.—Ewart’s opinions are as strong as Roebuck’s,
therefore it is not Roebuck’s opinions that are objected to, but his
conduct. I have been much disappointed by the fact, but I see clearly
that very few people are sorry for his being out of Parliament. The
Spectator too is injuring itself: I have been asked by radicals whether
the Spectator is going to imitate the Times—& one radical, a writer in
our review, told me that four persons in his knowledge, himself being
one, had just given it up. Rintoul13 will have to change his tack. As
for Fonblanque he is utterly disgusting: not one word to induce the
ministers to do anything, even at this critical time, but the old slang
about Tory radicals! I have done with him. My advice to the radicals is
to be active & stirring, but not to attack the ministry at all—unless
for Canadian measures or something positively bad. But I shall not say
so in the review, nor do I think it should be avowed as a principle at
all. My article14 will be full of speculations on all possible events
without predicting any & the principle of it will be that now is the
time for radical men of business. Make haste & shew yourself one. The
Transportation Committee15 is an excellent beginning. I shall shew that
our present straits have arisen because neither whigs nor radicals were
men of action. Both have shewn the most signal incapacity & inactivity.

I had nearly forgotten to tell you that your intentions about giving up
the Edition: current; Page: [1977] review next April were told to
Robertson above a week before I received your letter, by the “Great
Metropolis” man16—& by this time it must be known to all the world. this
is a great disadvantage added to the other difficulties we shall have to
contend with between this & April—if the secret has oozed out through
any of those who were so angry with Robertson on account of something
which they supposed that man had heard through him, it will be curious
enough.

TO SIR WILLIAM MOLESWORTH1

22d September
1837

Dear Molesworth

I am going out of town for a few weeks & before I go I wish to tell you
what has been doing about the review. This approaching number will I
think be the best we ever had, & as far as one number can, will be a
fair specimen of our present system. I have written two long articles
myself, one on Carrel,2 involving incidentally the whole political &
literary state of France; the other, a political manifesto,3 embracing
the whole of the present position of the country, judging all parties,
telling each what it has to do, & how far it has been wrong. The former
article I know you will like, the latter I hope you will. Yourself,
Buller, & Leader are the persons I am anxious to carry with me. If you
would like to see the article before it is published, write to Robertson
& he will send you a proof. It will not go to press quite yet, for I
shall take it with me into the country in case something further should
occur. Of our other articles, those to which I attach most consequence
are two; one on the Dissenters,4 by Robertson, who knows them better
than any other class, & better than any of us know [sic] them. I have
seen a great deal of this article, & I think it extremely good, & well
done, quite above anything Robertson ever wrote before: & without
offending anybody, or compromising any of our own principles, I think it
will give us for the first time a footing with Edition: current; Page:
[1978] the Dissenters: it will give us their ear, & be a beginning of
making us their leaders instead of the whigs. The other article, which I
consider the best literary article we ever had is on Italian literature
since 1830,5 written by a refugee named Usiglio with the assistance of
the celebrated Mazzini, the president of La Jeune Italie, & the most
eminent conspirator & revolutionist now in Europe: the article is of the
best school of continental criticism, the only good school of criticism
now going; & is full, besides, of interesting novelties. We have put
both Usiglio & Mazzini on our regular list, & we expect great help from
them.

The paper on Carrel I have written con amore & those who have seen it
think it the best thing I have yet done. I never admired any man as I
did Carrel; he was to my mind the type of a philosophic radical man of
action in this epoch. I have endeavoured to bring out this idea & many
others & shall probably publish the article with my name hereafter. The
leading ideas of the manifesto are 1. the necessity for ministers
immediately to propose the ballot. 2. the necessity of keeping the
Whings as our leaders if they will let us, on account of the
inefficiency of the radical party; shewing incidentally how far Roebuck
& the Spectator are right, how far wrong, & giving Fonblanque (without
naming him) a kick for his attacks of [sic] the Spectator which he will
never forgive me. 3. If the Whigs are to lead us, they must represent
the average of our opinions. England is moderate-radical. Advice to the
Whigs to throw themselves on the moderate-radicals. 4. Elaborate
enforcement of the truth that bold policy is prudent policy, & that to
undertake much is the way to succeed. The Whigs shewn to be rash from
cowardice, & to have fought all their battles at the greatest possible
disadvantage: what they ought to have done; what they ought now to do.
5. advice to our own radicals, to throw themselves on the working
classes. 6. Appeal to the working classes in favour of the radicals,
shewing them to be their only true friends. 7. Appeal to the people of
property in favour of the radicals, as the only true conservatives:
those who call themselves so being ready, as in the case of the Poor
Law, to sell them for place. 8. Exhortation to Reformers to stand at
their arms ready to act at a moment’s notice.

If Buller is still with you pray tell him that we shall have ample need
of him: & if anything occurs to him that he would like to do, which
would be timely about the end of next January, I hope he will write to
Robertson.

I have written since last June nearly a whole volume of my Logic, have
got over all the difficulties that had puzzled me, & see my way clearly
to soon finishing the book. I am therefore in high spirits about my
summer’s work.

I had nearly forgotten to mention the Hanover.6 I shall be in constant
communication with Robertson while I am out of town, shall see
everything before it is inserted, & if there is a word in the article
which from my knowledge Edition: current; Page: [1979] of your
sentiments I think you would not like, it shall not go in without your
seeing it.

I look forward with great hopes to your Report on Transportation.7 Lord
John Russell’s official adoption of the Philadelphia system makes the
whole question of secondary punishments plain sailing.8

ever faithfully yours

J. S. Mill

If you could give us an article on Secondary punishments9 for January or

My dear Sir

I have not been able to write to you sooner, as the crowd on Thursday
forced me to direct my steps anywhere rather than to the Athenæum, & I
had less time yesterday for reading your article2 than I expected. I
have now finished reading it & I most heartily congratulate the review
upon having such an article on such a subject as well as upon
establishing so satisfactory a connexion between itself and you. The
position you take up towards the Duke of Wellington is, I am satisfied,
the just one, in every respect, & such as it is becoming for those
radicals to assume, who desire as we do to recommend to admiration men
of action instead of men of talk, & the qualities which fit men to be
something instead of those which only enable them to seem. As friends of
democracy which has no danger so much to apprehend as that of becoming
quackocracy, we are most strongly interested in holding up such men as
the Duke of Wellington as our models even when they are our enemies.

Edition: current; Page: [1980]
It is for this very reason that I am anxious we should state these views
in such a way as to obtain most response from our own side—& as I have
continually found in my own case that what I write from my own prompting
may require a little modification to obviate chances of being
misunderstood, so it occurs to me that the first few pages of your
article, though not expressing one single idea or feeling but such as
ought to be expressed, may expose us to misconstruction simply from the
fact that they do not bear in their manner & tone sufficient evidence
that it is a radical who is speaking—There is little difference between
them & the very words which might be used by a Tory who was vindicating
the D. of W. against the aspersions of radicals—& many radicals will
take the censure to themselves, & combining this article with our
attacks on the Whigs, will ask as I have heard asked about the
Spectator, “are these people going to do like the Times”? If on
reperusing those pages the same remark should not strike yourself, it
would not create any difficulty about inserting the article, but it
would oblige us to prefix to it an editorial note or introduction which
would deprive the review of the credit it would derive from identifying
itself with such an article, & deprive the article of that additional
weight which even your writing like that of every one must in some
degree however small, derive from being delivered as the sentiments not
only of the writer but of a body who back him. It would be much more
satisfactory to us if by the mere throwing in or taking out of a phrase
here & there, you could give that slight turn to the introductory part
which is all that is required. No other part seems to be liable to the
same misconstruction—& the summing up near the end strikes me as quite
perfect.

There are a few minor points which may be worth noticing in the proof,
but not now—the only ones which occur to me at present are the following
two: We have always hitherto avoid[ed]3 committing ourselves on the
Russian question4 till we know more about it—& therefore are anxious if
possible not to be committed [to] it by a side wind on an occasion when
it [is] not absolutely called for. And secondly there are one or two
sentences in which the East India Company5 are spoken of in a tone which
might be very prejudicial Edition: current; Page: [1981] to one in this
house if they were printed in a review under my influence, & which I
think more severe than is actually deserved.

I will read the article again very carefully & then put it into the
hands of our editor, by con[ferring] with whom I may get some further
suggestions, but I do not think they can affect anything in this letter.

Direct to me India House—

Ever yours truly

In compliance with your request I have looked through the first two
volumes of the Rationale, & all I wish to suppress in those volumes is
the note at page 126 of the first volume.2 But I should wish my
signature, at the end of the preface, & all mention of my name, to be
omitted. I never intended to put my name to the book in any shape,3 &
only did so because Mr Bentham insisted on it, & I feared that if I
persisted in my refusal he would think I had done my work so ill as to
be ashamed to avow it.

I should also wish a paragraph to the effect of that on the opposite
page, to be added in brackets, at the end of the preface.4

My dear Sir

After keeping you so long without your proof, it is with a bad grace
that we ask you to return it quickly—but we are obliged to do so.

On reconsideration, I have resolved to ask your permission to revert to
the Edition: current; Page: [1983] plan you at one time were kind enough
to consent to, of putting your signature in full to the article.2 The
more I think of it the more I dislike to publish an article with a note
controverting or criticising it, prefixed. This would be unnecessary if
your name were annexed to the article; which would also add greatly to
the weight of all the statements & sentiments it contains.

The article is full of most valuable thoughts, & most powerful writing,
& I must in vindication of my own common sense, entreat you to believe,
that all which is said of the D[uke] of W[ellington] I fully agree in,
so far as I have any right to an opinion at all. My fears were, & are,
only that the tone would be misinterpreted—common readers take their
idea of what a writer says, entirely from the tone—they carry away an
impression derived from that & do not remember, or worse than that,
misrecollect from never having really observed, what was said.

However your name at the foot will prevent any misinterpretation.3

On the Russian question4 I have nothing to say. On what is said of the
E.I. Company my objection was not to anything affirmed as to the
injustice & crime of many kinds by which their Indian empire was
acquired,5 but to the apparent compliance with the popular prejudice
which ascribes to the Company, & to their interest as a trading body,
proceedings arising from the sinister interests (sometimes trading
interests) of their servants in India, which they themselves partly from
right feeling, partly from a view of those very interests of the Company
as a trading body, steadily discountenanced. See my father’s history,
passim. I believe the E.I.C. to have always been, & I know it to be now,
what my father represented it, the government which of all others
(except perhaps the U.S. of America) wishes to do, & does, most for the
people under its sway, & the protector of the natives of India against
the avarice & domineering spirit of rapacious European adventurers—

ever faithfully yours

My dear Sir

I never had for a moment the idea of suggesting to you to make any
alterations because they would suit my views or those of the review,
unless you Edition: current; Page: [1984] should also think that they
would be not only consistent with your own, but would enable them to be
stated with even more effect, because less liable to be misunderstood.2
The views themselves I should not have presumed, on such a subject, to
object to, even if my own had been different—instead of being, as they
are, exactly the same. I, also, wish all who do not do justice to the
D[uke] of W[ellington] to be rebuked, whether they are radicals or not:
only, as the review must not, & shall not, offend the great body of its
supporters & injure or ruin its chances of success, not for the sake of
telling wholesome truths but of telling them in a certain manner,
without the explanations which that manner requires—it shall be my study
to give those explanations in a note—which I would have preferred that
the writer himself should have done—that is all. That the manner itself
is either wrong, or in the least degree liable to misinterpretation if
it were known to come from you, I neither said nor think.

Since I have not been able to induce you to enter into this view of the
matter, I must do without: but I hope you do not think me so silly, if I
wanted a “hired writer” to write what he did not think, as to apply to
you for the purpose.

We accept your alternative of your initials & a note, if you will oblige
us by leaving out the words “exempt from Editorial interference” which
are a bad precedent, & allow it to run thus: “The following article is
by agreement to be considered as the expression of the writer’s
individual sentiments without involving the opinions of this review. Who
the writer is may be easily discovered by the style, the sentiments, &
the initials.”2

Should you have any objection to add to the words “especially the Whigs”
a note, stating just what you say in your letter, as explanatory of the
tone? It might begin thus: “Some of our readers may not recollect the
tone of the Whigs towards the D[uke] of W[ellington] some years
ago”—then adding the passage from Perry’s article, &, (if it would be
proper) the anecdote of Barry O’Meara.3 This would make a capital note,
& by exciting indignation would put the reader into a fit state of mind
for appreciating, & feeling with, your denunciation of such injustices.

This I think would put all perfectly right.

My dear Molesworth

On returning from the country I found your letter. You say nothing in it
about your health but I hear from other quarters satisfactory accounts
of it, to my very great contentment.

I shall be happy to give you any assistance in my power in preparing for
your edition of Hobbes,2 but I am not aware that my father ever wrote
anything respecting him except what is in the Fragment on Mackintosh.3
We will of course put in the prospectus for nothing. Tait’s £17 is on
every account yours;4 the review has no claim to it; only if you get it
let Woolcombe5 know, so that he may include it in his statement of your
disbursements for the review which I am sorry to say it goes but a
little way to liquidate.

Our last number has sold very well: there are only about 150 remaining
out of 2000, & I hear from Hooper that many have gone to libraries,
where there is good hope of its leading to the review’s being
permanently taken. If it had not been for the cursed Canada business,
which, I have now ascertained, reduced our then rapidly rising sale by
full one fifth, it would have paid by this time. However I hope even
this will profit us in the end, for the present turn in Canada affairs
brings Lord Durham6 home incensed to the utmost (as Buller writes to
me)7 with both Whigs & Tories, Whigs especially and in the best possible
mood for setting up for himself, & if so the formation of an efficient
party of moderate radicals, of which our review will be the organ, is
certain—the Whigs will be kicked out never more to rise, & Lord D. will
be head of the liberal party and ultimately prime minister. I am
delighted with Buller; his letters to his father & mother & to me shew
him Edition: current; Page: [1988] in a nobler character than he ever
appeared in before, & he & Wakefield8 seem to be acting completely as
one man speaking to Lord D. with the utmost plainness, giving him the
most courageous and judicious advice, which he receives both generously
& wisely. He is the man for us, & we shall have him & make a man of him
yet.

I was sure you would admire Comte’s book9 as I do myself, but it is
rather too dry for the review yet. Have you seen the third volume, the
philosophy of chemistry & physiology? I have been almost as much struck
with it as with the others & have learnt as much from it, though there
are more questionable things in the former two, but even on those he has
shaken me. Pray read it.

I have received your 25 copies10 & will do all I can to circulate them
where they will be useful. Pray bear the subject of Secondary
Punishments11 in mind for our February or Easter number.

There is a great game for you to play in the next session of parliament.
Buller has the best cards in the H. of C. & I think he will play them
well, but yours are the next best. As for me this has awakened me out of
a period of torpor about politics during which my logic has been
advancing rapidly. This winter I think will see me through the whole of
it except the rewriting.

I have referred to the note which you mention2—it is of very trifling
importance, & so far as I am concerned I give my full consent to your
omitting it or not as you may deem most for the interest of the work. I
do not indeed feel the force of the objection to it—what is said about
the incarceration of extraneous witnesses refers to the expediency, as a
matter of principle, & Edition: current; Page: [1989] I understand from
you that my friend Doane’s3 note refers to the existing practice of
which I do not find that I said anything in my note. Nor do I see the
inconsistency between it & p. 232. However it is very probable that you
& Doane who have considered the matter much more & more recently are in
the right, & that I should think so if I saw his note—& therefore once

Dear Molesworth

What think you of all this rumpus in Canada? I find all the Whigs &
moderates here blame Lord Durham for the Proclamation, & he has already
the greater part of the real radicals against him for the Ordinance. But
I think the liberal party in the country generally is with him. I mean
to stand by him, as my letters from Buller, & Rintoul’s from Wakefield
convince me that he was quite right in resigning & that he comes home
fully prepared (if the damned pseudo-radicals do not get round him &
talk him over) to set up for himself. For the purpose of acting at once
upon him & upon the country in that sens, I have written an elaborate
defence of him which will be published in the review next week,2 & will
be in the newspapers before that. I hope exceedingly that you will
approve of it for if this man really tries to put himself at the head of
the liberals, your standing by him will do a world of good. What a pity
Leader made such a damned fool of himself after you quitted town.

Write to me sometimes to say how you are. The Prospectus of Hobbes3 is
very well done but I am sorry the price of the book is to be so high, as
I Edition: current; Page: [1990] fear few will give so much for it
except for making libraries—not for bona fide reading.

By the bye Nichol4 who has been roaming about, finds that a letter to
him franked by you, has miscarried, & he begs me to ask you whom you
franked it for. I do not think it was for me, as he seems to have got
all my letters.

When you write on Secondary Punishments5 which I hope will be soon, &
for us, I must shew you the Report of a Committee at Calcutta on Prisons
& Prison Discipline in India.6 It is full of good observations & the
writer is up to the most advanced ideas on penal law. Though the subject
is prisons, all the questions of secondary punishment are in fact
included in it. I do not send you a copy, for only one has yet reached
the India house.

TO GUSTAVE DE BEAUMONT1

India House

18th October
1839

My dear Beaumont

You have been made acquainted by my friend Grant with my absence from
England at the time when your letter was received here, & the cause of
it—I did not return here till July, it was some time longer before your
book2 reached me, & as so much time had already elapsed I determined to
delay writing to you until I should have thoroughly read & considered
the book. I have only lately been able to do so, especially as the
reading of such a book, the kind of book of all others the most
delightful to me, an occupation which always, if I can, reserve for a
moment, not only of leisure but of pleasurable leisure—a sort of
intellectual luxury, to be enjoyed at ease.

I hardly know how to express to you the degree of my estimation of your
book, in as measured terms as a sober man likes to use in expressing a
deliberate judgment—but this I may say, in the confidence of being
rather Edition: current; Page: [1991] within than beside the mark—that
the book not only displays a complete & easy mastery over all the social
elements & agencies at work in Ireland, over the whole great [world?] of
Irish history & Irish civilization; but th[at] it also manifests a
degree of clear comprehension & accurate knowledge of the far more
complicated & obscure phenomen[a] of English society, never before even
approached by any foreigner whom I know of, & by very, very few
Englishmen. Even those Englishmen who know their own country best, may
learn much from the connected & enlarged mode of exhibiting what they
know, which is characteristic of all good writers & thinkers of your
country; & that benefit we were sure [to] receive, from the views of
English affairs taken by a mind like yours; but what surprises me more,
& contrasts more strikingly with the many gross blunders in matters of
fact usual[ly] made by Frenchmen in writing about England, is, that in
your two volumes I have not been able to detect one error of material
importance in the statements [made] & very few indeed even of a trifling
kind. To shew how few & how small they are I will just mention two of
them, assuring you that they are quite the two greatest errors I have
found in the book. The fictions of fine & recovery, so judiciously
characterized by you, & which you say will not easily be abolished, have
been abolished for the last two or three years3 by a bill emanating from
the late Real Property Commission; carried through Parliament by the
Attorney General;4 & by which owners of land are now empowered to do
directly what formerly they could only do in that circuitous manner. The
other mistake is, that the Whigs have abandoned the Ballot. The fact is
notorious here that every year more & more of the Whigs are converted to
the Ballot, & none have ever been converted from it. I suppose you must
have been led into this opinion by the fact that Lord Althorp5 & one or
two others connected with the Whig ministry had voted for the Ballot
formerly but that was before the Reform Bill, & the reason that they
[announced?] that change was, that the R. Bill had done so much for the
democratic principle that a fair trial ought to be given to it without
any fur[ther?] [—?] that they were precluded by an implied promise at
[the] time when the Bill passed from proposing any further reform. I
should add that in those days, when Lord Althorp voted for the ballot he
was not considered a Whig, & so hostile to the ballot were all the Whigs
that the Ballot was considered ultra-Radicalism, the very ne plus ultra
of Democracy. A few rational persons like Lord Althorp alone saw that it
was not so.

Edition: current; Page: [1992]
Your book on the whole gives an impression, perhaps, too favorable to
the English aristocracy in England, & suggests the idea that the evils &
abuses in England are less than I think them; but this was an inevitable
consequence of representing England in contrast with Ireland, where all
the natural evil tendencies of our institutions are so much aggravated
by the causes you so well point out; all the distinctions which you
draw, really exist, & you have, especially in the latter half of the
second volume, guarded as much perhaps as it was possible to do against
the kind of impression which was in some degree inevitable.

In your views of what the different parties in England can do or are
likely to do for Ireland, I entirely agree; as well as in your views of
what ought to be done; with one exception: I think that more might be
done by emigration, than you appear to consider possible. You ha[ve]
probably not [adverted?] to the improved principles of Colonization
first promulgated by Mr Wakefield6 (the son of the Wakefield who wrote
on Ireland)7 & now generally adopted both by political writers &
practical statesmen among us. I was nearly the first proselyte whom he
made to them.8 I have in my turn helped to convince others that by
selling all new land in the colonies, for such a price as shall prevent
the usual dispersion of settlers all over the country (so incompatible
with the combination & division of labour) & appropriating the produce
to paying the expenses of emigration you may raise out of the wealth
actually created by emigration a fund increasing by geometrical
progression, to pay the expenses of further emigration. If indeed the
expense had to be born by the state, I should agree with you in
despairing of the attainment, although I do not think the number of
persons necessary to be removed, so great as you do. I think the only
instance in which you seem to me to have overvalued any article of
testimony is that of the Irish Poor Law Commission Reports. That
Commission was entirely led by Dr. Whately,9 who went into the enquiry
with a strong preconceived opinion against Poor Laws—the biassing effect
of which is easily seen; & the Secretary of the Commission, Revans,10
has pointed out the fallacy by which they were led greatly to overrate
the number of destitute persons in Ireland—they computed Edition:
current; Page: [1993] all the itinerant poor who passed through a
particular district in a given time, & then multiplied that number in
the ratio which all Ireland bore to the size of the particular
district—forgetting that the beggars of Ireland ply all over Ireland, &
that they would have met with the very same men successively in a great
many places.

I have not a word more to say in dissent from any thing in the book;
which goes to the very bottom of the subject it treats of, & must place
you, in the mind of every competent judge, in a rank among European
thinkers, which even the promise of your former writings excellent as
they were, could scarcely have justified us in expecting. We have only
now to hope that you may live long & write other such books.

ever yours faithfully

I have referred to two copies of the Rationale of Evidence in my
possession, & I find neither of them has any errata. I have no
recollection whatever of any such circumstance, nor can I recal to mind
anything connected with the subject. It is therefore pretty certain that
the alterations were not suggested by Mr Bentham himself, to me at
least, or I should have remembered something about it.2 He may have had
a paper of Errata printed afterwards—or I may have done it myself—but in
neither case can I account for the non appearance of the paper in most
of the copies.

Unless Bowring3 can throw some light upon the subject, I fear it must
remain in darkness.

It cannot I think be worth while to cancel anything on account of this
oversight.

Robertson has read to me your letter on the Church quarrel,4 which
interested me much—

From the nature & wording of your extract from the errata I should
conjecture that they are Bentham’s own.2 If so, either Bowring or Doane,
with both of whom you are in communication & I am not, are the only
persons likely to be able to throw any light upon it. No doubt the
errata were inserted after many of the copies were sold.

I purposely struck out of the opening chapter in the MS whatever was
said about securing the forthcomingness of evidence, because there was
nothing corresponding to it in the work itself. The author seemed to
have intended to include that subject in the Treatise, but to have
changed his views as he went on, & reserved it for Procedure—

My dear Molesworth

Your note of the 11th of last month was sent to me into the country & I
should have written sooner to thank you for what you did in relation to
the Lunatic Asylum if I had not wished to be able at the same time to
give you a satisfactory answer to your enquiries about my Logic. I have
been working at it in the country &, I am happy to say, have finished
it—the first draft of it I mean for a great deal of it will require
rewriting, & some parts of it, probably, recasting, in order that the
earlier parts may have the benefit of the new lights struck out in the
latter ones. Of course too there is much to do to it in the way of
making it clearer & more popular—& perhaps some of the details require
to be worked out more carefully, but I do not expect to have anything to
add to the ideas. I hope this winter will enable me to do all that is
necessary & that I may begin to print next summer.

I think very much as you do about Whewell’s book. His “History”2 was of
great use to me, by bringing before me all that had been done & the
manner in which it had been done. I have got nothing new from his
“Philosophy” though I think it likely to be a useful book—his theory is
much better than no theory—& his “ideas” are really the metaphysical
premisses of the sciences the only contestable point being their a
priori origin. I shall have to dwell more upon that point in rewriting
my book, than I have done & it is a great advantage to have the floating
doctrines of the enemy fixed in a book of authority, because then one
cannot be required to do more than answer what is said in the book.

You ask me if anything good has lately come out, in answer to which
enquiry I request your acceptance of something very good.

Your Leeds demonstration3 seems to me a very proper thing, done in the
very best way—& I think that is the general impression about it. I
cannot but think that it has done & will do good, both in France & here
& I am sure it has had a good effect in raising your public character.

Fonblanque has been doing admirably on this war question.4 It is the
Edition: current; Page: [1996] first time that he has thrown off his
ministerial livery. The Times also has been rendering good service of
late.

I hope to hear from you now & then

I showed your play2 to the most superior woman I have ever known,3 and
the most fastidious judge of poetry, and she writes to me about it: “I
like the play very much. I think the subject an excellent one, and the
mode of saying it natural, healthy, and quite free from the affectation
of ‘old dramatists’, which is an affectation I, of all others, most
nauseate. It is the only play, and almost the only poem, of the present
time which I know without affected mannerism.”

I think it worth while telling you of this opinion, because, if you were
acquainted with the writer, I am sure you would attach real value to her
judgment, and especially to her approbation.—

My dear Maurice

Thank you very sincerely for your book,2 which I have just now finished
reading. As a production of intellect I could say much in admiration of
it; but that I know is not what you would most like to hear. It is very
pleasant to find oneself so much in sympathy, both morally and
intellectually, with a writer from whose fundamental principles and from
many of whose practical conclusions one is obliged to dissent.

I have also just finished a second and more careful reading of your
Moral Philosophy in the Enc Metr.3 This is still more interesting to me
than the other and I can assent to more of history being a subject on
which we have more principles in common. I agree to a much greater
extent than you would perhaps suppose, in your view, even of the
historical position of the Jews. I believe I was cured of many of my
crude notions about them by the writings Edition: current; Page: [1998]
of Salvador,4 a Jew by race and by national feeling, a Frenchman by
birth, and a rationalist of the school of Paulus5 by opinion, whose book
on the Mosaic institutions and on the Jewish people though somewhat
ludicrous in its adaptation of Moses to a Voltairian public and in its
attempts to prove that the Jews were Constitutional Liberals and
Utilitarians is yet so full of strong facts and even arguments that it
made a great impression on me when I read it a year or two ago.

I shall have a book of my own to offer to you in a few months;6 though I
am afraid you will not be able to look upon it or its tendency with any
favour, as though I do not concern myself with ontological questions
directly the whole effect of the book where it produces any, must be
anti-ontological. However you will find in it if you read it, several
opinions warmly contended for, which were perhaps never found before in
writings of the school of Locke, and some which I believe I first learnt
from yourself.

Ever yours

TO ARTHUR HELPS1

[

My dear Sir—

When I began reading your proofs I intended after the first reading to
go through them a second time carefully, annotating as I went on, but
when I came to the last two essays the minute criticisms which I thought
of making, rather because you asked me than because they seemed to me of
much importance, became merged in a radical difference of opinion &
sentiment. I think I can best express this difference by saying that
your mode of thinking is grounded on the supposition that the present
constitution both of social & of domestic life is essentially right,
while I think that there is in them both, much that is fundamentally
wrong. So great a difference must lead to all sorts of minor ones on
such subjects as “the art of living with Edition: current; Page: [2001]
others” & “education”. In my estimation the art of living with others
consists first & chiefly in treating & being treated by them as equals.
Of course nothing can be more contrary to your doctrine that differences
of judgment or inclination should be settled not by the force of
sufficient reason but by “some authorized will”. From your description &
from others I must suppose that a great portion of mankind are so full
of miserable pettiness, so tracassière, annoying, illtempered,
interfering & unreasonable as to be entirely Edition: current; Page:
[2002] unfit to live together: I have never known such people among
those with whom I have been in intimate companionship, but if people
find it difficult to live together without “hating”, having “a [quiet?]
distaste for” one another, in the first place their continuing living
together at all seems to me an [immorality?] & in the next place the
remedy would rather be a great cultivation of high principle &
amiableness than a “just sway”. This being my opinion it follows of
course that I do not consider the living together of men & women to be
an exception to it nor can I think that relation will ever be other than
a comparative failure while instead of being an association between
equals, it is grounded on “sway” on one side, dependence on the other, &
the dependent is systematically educated for feebleness of mind. The
“petting” which you speak of is a wretched substitute for reason &
justice, but it is the least that can be done where those are withheld.

In the essay on “Education” again it is assumed that inequality is a
thing which should be cultivated, that people should be educated with a
view to a “just progression of nice distinctions of rank.” As I look
upon inequality as in itself always an evil, I do not agree with any one
who would use the machinery of society for the purpose of promoting it.
As much inequality as necessarily arises from protecting all persons in
the free use of their faculties of body & mind & in the enjoyment of
what these can obtain for them, must be submitted to for the sake of a
greater good: but I certainly see no necessity for artificially adding
to it, while I see much for tempering it, impressing both on the laws &
on the usages of mankind as far as possible the contrary tendency.

I regret much not having found time to consider & return the proofs
sooner.

of cockneyism, not however in his language or accent.

These two are all that you have officially applied for, but as you
unofficially apply for five or six, I recommend making the application
official without delay, especially as I yesterday had an interview on
the subject with Abp. Whately2 in consequence of your letter to him, &
it appears you have applied to the right quarter, for (while his
National Schools are the best possible school for what you want) he
tells me that even the Inspectors, though some of them are graduates of

what you give—& as he will make known your requirements & conditions to
them, there is no doubt we shall have no lack of applications.

My dear Sir,

I much regret to find that you are suffering in health & I am sure you
cannot too much abstain, while that is the case, from your really
wearing occupation. Your question about the Essay on the Laws of
Interchange3 Edition: current; Page: [2006] is very natural, & it is one
which I put to myself, with some doubt as to its result when I adopted
my present opinions on Currency. But on carefully revising the ideas of
the Essay I found in them nothing which clashed. You will observe that
the speculations in that Essay do not relate to the effects of
fluctuations but only of permanent changes in the amount of bullion in a
country & those I imagine even Tooke4 would allow to have an effect on
prices, governed as these changes must be by changes in the costs (not
indeed of producing bullion at the mines—but) of purchasing & importing
it into the country. Au reste I believe I have set all that matter in a
clear light in the book I am now finishing & have adjusted the different
segments of my opinions into one another with due attention to the
fitting. There is a writer in the Chronicle who is a considerable master
of good humoured raillery. He has written in today’s paper on the
Anti-gold League.5

India House

3d Feby 1848

Dear Sir

I hope the Auditors will excuse my declining the honour they propose
conferring upon me—in the first place because any matter relating to the
checking & controlling of accounts may easily be entrusted to a person
much more qualified for it than myself—and secondly because my
occupation at the India House during business hours would make it very
difficult & inconvenient for me to fulfil any obligation which might
require my attendance at the distance of University College.

should have been glad to have conversed with you on some of the topics
in the Pol. Ec. as well as on others.

Dear Chadwick

I am grieved to hear such an account of Miss Nightingale’s health. I
shall certainly read her book2 at the first opportunity, not for any
benefit to myself, for my ailments have never yet been of a kind to
require nursing; but for the reasons you give as well as others that are
obvious, I do not need it to enable me to share the admiration which is
felt towards her more universally, I should think, than towards any
other living person.

I am afraid I shall hardly be able, during the short time of my stay, to
make out a visit to you. The ignorance and rawness of all ranks on the
subject of representation are certainly amazing, and only equalled by
their self-satisfied indifference to further knowledge. You will not get
your inquiry,3 for everybody has made up his mind to do something this
year without waiting either for knowledge or thought.

Dear Chadwick

I have had two notes from you which ought to have been answered, but
what with occupation, and the weather which has been unfavourable to
fixing Edition: current; Page: [2010] beforehand any time for a walk,
they have remained unanswered till now. I should have written directly
if I could have told of anything that could be useful to you or Mr
Bagehot on the subject treated of in your pamphlet.2 But I could only
have referred you and him to the Socialist writers, particularly in
France, who have laid great stress upon the same class of considerations
which you have brought forward. I should like to have a talk with you on
the question, and to explain where I do and do not agree with you; and I
hope to be able to arrange a meeting and a walk, but I am unable to do
so just at present.

I beg you to thank Miss Nightingale very particularly for the new
edition of her Notes.3 I have read the additional matter, and think it
quite equal to the preceding. But I confess I wish the sentence we
talked of were omitted.4 There is nobody that I know of who deserves the
stigma it conveys; while it gives the sanction of Miss Nightingale’s
authority to the attempt to run down those who are contending that the
only way in which either women or men can find out what they can and
cannot do, is by being allowed to try; and that it is a gross injustice
to women that men should pass sentence in the matter beforehand, by
peremptorily excluding them from anything.

Dear Sir

I have had the pleasure of receiving your note. A letter of mine to Mr
Potter,2 which appeared in the newspapers about three months ago, and to
which considerable attention was drawn by the Westminster contest,
explained the differences of opinion which prevented, and still prevent
me from becoming a member of the Reform League. But I do not the less
confidently expect that I shall be found acting in general cooperation
with the members of the League,3 as my opinions on Reform, though in
some respects different, are fully as radical as theirs. I think that
the general promotion of the Reform cause is the main point at present,
and that advanced reformers, without Edition: current; Page: [2011]
suppressing their opinions on the points on which they may still differ,
should act together as one man in the common cause

Dear Chadwick

The position in which I am, and which is the cause of my not having
answered your last two letters, is that of being obliged to postpone
absolutely every political or parliamentary subject till the meeting of
Parliament. A great many things have fallen on me at once, to which I
was pledged before my election, and which can only be done in the
present recess, and I am at my wit’s end to know how they are possibly
to be got through. My attending any meeting is quite out of the
question; almost as much so as my going to see schools or workhouses, or
writing to the President of the Poor Law Board as you proposed. I cannot
turn my thoughts to such things till next January.

Sir

Your letter of the 23d instant has been forwarded to me here. As I do
not expect to be in England until the meeting of Parliament, there will
be no opportunity for the interview proposed by the Executive Council.2
Neither is it probable that such an interview, if intended to invite my
cooperation with the Reform League, would lead to any useful result.
While I consider myself a fellow labourer with the League in the cause
of democratic reform, Edition: current; Page: [2012] considered
generally, I have no former occasions stated the reasons3 why I cannot
join in a movement for the special objects proposed by the League,
manhood suffrage and the Ballot: both which questions, moreover have
been so largely discussed, and have necessarily been so long under
consideration both by the members of the Executive Council and by
myself, that it is not likely our opinions can be modified or any new
arguments of importance suggested on either side by a short
conversation.

I quite agree with those who think that the intended Reform Bill should
include a lodger franchise,2 but if I were to suggest beforehand all the
provisions of a more or less novel character which I think it ought to
include, I should have many others to propose besides that particular
one. I would, therefore, rather not take any part in a separate movement
for a lodger franchise, though I shall gladly give my adhesion and
support to such a proposal if made in the House of Commons

The Reform Movement has thus far been conducted with great energy and
judgment, and I have no doubt that the demonstration on Monday will be a
Edition: current; Page: [2013] signal and most valuable success. I feel
it, however, on several grounds, better that I should not personally
take part in it. In the first place the same evening has been chosen by
the Government for the announcement of their plans for Reform, and this
is likely to lead to a debate, from which I ought not to be absent.
(Cheers.) Independent of this I do not feel capable of doing work of a
great public meeting and in the House too. (Hear.) I think it best that
my taking part in public meetings should be confined to exceptional
cases, and your former great meeting at the Agricultural Hall2 was an
exceptional case, and you know what special reasons there were for the
course I took on that occasion. (Cheers.) If at the present time there
was the smallest probability of any attempt to interfere with your
Demonstration, I would come at once, and take my share of whatever
befell. (Loud cheers.)

Dear Lady Russell

The reputation of Lord Russell can need no aid from me to give it a
lasting record, for what he has done would and must stand in history
beyond the reach of dispute. Nor do I think that the country has
forgotten what it owes Edition: current; Page: [2014] to him, or that it
will ever fail to pay him that respect which a nation—whatever may be
the case with its upper classes—always feels towards honesty of purpose,
whenever fortunate enough to find it in its statesmen. I think you will
find that Lord Russell’s name usually occupies the place of honour in
the resolutions moved in the Reform meetings throughout the country; and
when it is not mentioned in them, it is because they have especial
reference to the incidents of the debates in the House of Commons.

Accept, I beg, dear Lady Russell, my sincere thanks for the great
compliment which I feel your letter pays me, however much I think you
overestimate my ability, and believe me

I wrote to your uncle2 some two years ago, telling him that I should be
happy to see you at a time which I named, when I had leisure to be able
to do so, but I have received no reply to my letter. I should still be
very happy to see you, but think it very probable that I may be
otherwise engaged at the time you mention this year. I will, however,
write if I should find myself disengaged at the time you wish to see me,
and if I should not be so, and you continue to wish to see me next year,
there would be a better chance of your doing so if you were to write in
time for me to fix any portion of your holidays when I may be at
leisure; because my time is too much occupied for you to be able to
count on my being disengaged at any given moment.

Your cousin3 and myself desire to be kindly remembered to your father
when you write to him.

TO GEORGE FRANCIS TRAIN1

House of Commons

London

,
July 2, 1868

Dear Sir—

Before asking the question you wished me to put in the House of Commons
respecting Warren and Costello,2 I took measures to ascertain what was
the answer I had to expect. I found it would be to this effect: That
they were convicted not of words spoken in America, but of a political
attempt to invade the United Kingdom, and that they had been selected
from the crew of the Jackmel, for prosecution and punishment, not
because the remainder had not incurred an equal liability to it, but
because these two examples were deemed sufficient. When I heard this I
thought that asking the question publicly would do the prisoners no
good, and would only enable the government to claim and obtain credit
for clemency.3

If, with this explanation, you still wish the question asked, and if the
prisoners wish it, I have not the smallest objection to ask it, but I
cannot undertake to carry the matter any further, and, whatever may be
my friendly feeling to America, I could not maintain that American
citizens, any more than other people, ought to be allowed without
punishment to carry on private war against a country with which the
United States are at peace.—I am, dear Sir, &c.,

that a discussion will be thereby produced. Discussion is not allowed in

reasons stated in my former note, I cannot undertake to bring forward
any motion on the subject.—I am, dear Sir, yours very faithfully,

Dear Madam—

Your letter of August 16 has been sent to me here. The copy of my little
book2 was intended for you, and I had much pleasure in offering it. The
movement against women’s disabilities generally, and for the suffrage in
particular, has made great progress in England since you were last
there. It is likely, I think, to be successful in the colonies later
than in England, because the want of equality in social advantages
between women and men is less felt in the colonies owing, perhaps, to
women’s having less need of other occupations than those of married
life.

I am, dear Madam, yours very truly,

Henry (later Sir Henry) James Summer Maine (1822-1888), comparative
historian and jurist; law member of the Viceroy’s Executive Council in
India, 1862-69; Professor of Historical and Comparative Jurisprudence at
Oxford, 1869-77; Master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, 1877-87; Whewell
Professor of International Law, Cambridge, 1887-88.

2.
Probably papers relating to the Oudh Rent Bill of 1868 and the Punjab
Tenancy Act of the same year.

3.
Upon his retirement from the East India Co. in 1858.

4.
Charles Cornwallis, first Marquis and second Earl Cornwallis
(1738-1805), governor-general of India and commander-in-chief in Bengal,
1786-93. By the legislation known as the Permanent Settlement of the
Land Revenue, Cornwallis in 1793 gave perpetual land rights, on
condition of the payment of a fixed land tax, to the zamindars,
tax-collectors who had acquired quasi-proprietorship of estates
entrusted to them by the government. The code was criticized as unjust
to under-tenants and peasants.

5.
The Bengal Rent Act of 1859 defined the rights of under-tenants and
farmers, as well as those of the superior landholders. It extended some
protection to the peasants.

6.
The transferal of the government of India from the East India Co. to the
Crown.

7.
The spellings vary: Talookdars, Taluqdars, Talukdars; Oude is ordinarily
spelled Oudh. They were the somewhat less than three hundred feudal
barons who at the time of the annexation of Oudh in Feb., 1856,
possessed two-thirds of the province. See Letter 314, n. 7.

viceroy of India, 1863-69.

10.
Richard Southwell Bourke Mayo, 6th Earl of Mayo (1822-1872), statesman;
chief secretary for Ireland in three administrations, he had just been
appointed viceroy of India.

11.
The Duke was secretary of state for India in the Gladstone cabinet,
1868-74. Possessed of vast holdings in the north of Scotland, the Duke
had been responsible for the eviction of tens of thousands of
“crofters,” in order to create immense pasturelands for sheep. Leone
Levi (1821-1888), jurist and statistician, in June 1865, read a paper to
the Statistical Society of London on “The Economic Condition of the
Highlands and the Islands of Scotland” (Journal of the Statistical
Society, XXVIII [1865], 372-401), in which he charged the Duke of Argyll
and his predecessors with responsibility for the depopulation of
Scotland. The Duke refuted the charges in a paper to the Society (ibid.,
XXIX [Dec., 1866], 504-35), and took issue (p. 529) with JSM’s views of
the ownership of land as evidenced in a recent debate on the Irish
Tenure of Land Bill.

12.
Settlement officers, i.e. assessors of land revenue, in the Punjab in
1865, for example, submitted a report favouring the claims of the
landlords.

13.
The figure had been calculated for the single district of Amritsar, in
the Punjab. The former settlement in 1853, after the conquest of the
province, had recorded existing rights in the land. Under the new
proposals, former owners would become tenants at will, liable to rent
increases and eviction.

14.
A bill to amend the land tenancy law in the Punjab was debated at length
in the Legislative Council on Oct. 19, 1868. The bill was
enthusiastically supported by Maine, and passed. Maine’s speech is
published in Sir Henry Maine, A brief Memoir by Sir M. E. Grant Duff.
With some of his Indian Speeches and Minutes, ed. Whitley Stokes (New
York, 1892), pp. 268-85.

15.

Various Countries (London, 1870), pp. 145-227.

16.
“Slip of the pen.”

17.
Established by acts of 1841 and 1852, this Commission worked to change
copyhold, an ancient form of land tenure, into freehold. Maine had
referred to the Commission in his speech of Oct. 19, 1868 (see Sir Henry
Maine in n. 14 above, p. 282).

18.
JSM may have made the acquaintance of Maine about 1857 when Maine had
published articles opposing the Crown’s taking over the government of
India from the East India Co.

the New York World, 1862-76.

2.
Presumably the annual convention of the National Labor Union, held in
New York City, Sept. 21, 1868. An estimated 600,000 organized workmen
were represented; for the first time working women’s organizations were
included in the representation.

3.
See Letter 1292, n. 5. In 1868 the Democratic Party, at the time
generally proinflationary or at least anti-deflationary, in its platform
adopted in July, 1868, had advocated the payment of bonds in greenbacks,
though its unsuccessful candidate for the Presidency, Horatio Seymour,
was generally regarded as a “hard-money” man.

4.
Letter 1292.

1.
MS draft at Johns Hopkins. Bears corrections and emendations in Helen
Taylor’s hand. Published in Elliot, II, 174-75. In reply to Smalley’s of
Dec. 31, 1868, also at Johns Hopkins.

George Washburn Smalley (1833-1916), American journalist; foreign
correspondent of the New York Tribune, 1866-95. He had met JSM at
Avignon, in the summer of 1866, with an introduction from Thomas Hughes.
Smalley’s account of JSM is reprinted in his London Letters (2 vols.,
New York, 1891), I, 232-40.

2.
Smalley had sent two copies of the New York Tribune containing his
account of JSM’s defeat for Westminster: “The English Elections,” Dec.
1, 1868, pp. 1-2, and “The Lesson of the English Elections,” Dec. 2,
1868, p. 4.

3.
He attributed the defeat as primarily due to Smith’s lavish expenditure
and the superior organization of the Tories, but Smalley also conceded
that “No doubt . . . Mr. Mill was a hard man to keep in order during the
canvass, and offended some thinskinned Liberals by his letters in behalf
of Bradlaugh and Odger.”

4.
In the provisional government set up after the revolution of 1868, most
wanted a monarchy though some favoured a federal republic. In 1869 the
Cortes voted for a monarchy with a liberal democratic constitution.

5.
A number of candidates, from various royal families, refused the offer.
Finally, the Duke of Aosta, son of the King of Italy, accepted; after
encountering much opposition, however, he abdicated early in 1873.

6.
General Juan Prim, Marquis de los Castillejos, Count de Reus
(1814-1870), had organized insurrections in Spain while in exile in
1866; after the revolution he became marshal and president of the
Council. He was assassinated in 1870.

Rathbone in his letter had said that the managers of the Philomathic
Society were unanimous in wishing to hear JSM’s views on “either Trade
Societies, the land question, or the employment of charitable
endowments. . . . The only thing to avoid was to make the dinner into a
strictly party demonstration.”

O’Grady’s of Jan. 9, also at Johns Hopkins.

Of the several contemporaries bearing this name, the most likely
recipient of this letter was Standish O’Grady (1846-1928), Irish
historian, author, and publicist; a native of Cork, son of a protestant
rector, and an 1868 graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. Later, owner
and editor of the All-Ireland Review.

2.
O’Grady in his letter had asked JSM for substantiation of his statement
in his Logic (“Of the Grounds of Disbelief,” Book III, chap. xxv, sec.
2): “If we do not already believe in supernatural agencies, no miracle
can prove to us their existence.”

At this point in the draft the following paragraph was deleted by JSM:

The composition of the Ministry is much what we would have expected from
the composition of the Parliament. Gladstone has evidently interpreted
the elections as indicating that the advanced section of Liberals is not
strong in the electoral body & he has therefore given the lion’s share
to the backward section, bestowing only minor appointments on the
radicals, or reputed radicals, with the exception of Bright, whose
opinions do not place him in what is now the advanced party. Gladstone
has perhaps something of the deference of a novus homo for the old
nobility & he may very reasonably think that the advanced liberals will
be content if anything considerable is done for their opinions, while
the others must have office to obtain their consent to any measures of a
radical complexion. I never felt more uncertainty about the immediate
future of politics: but I do not doubt that after a few years, & perhaps
even at the next general election, the working classes will feel & use
their strength; though probably they will not use it fully until the
obstacles have been removed to a junction of the Conservatives of both
sides of the House against them. One’s feelings of uncertainty are
increased by the element of uncertainty as to what, in any change of
political circumstances, Gladstone would do. One feels pretty confident
that he would do what his conscience dictated, but it is impossible to
foresee what, in new circumstances its dictates would be.

MS not located. Copied into the Minutes of the Senate of St. Andrews
University, Feb. 13, 1869. Published by Dr. Anna J. Mill in the Scottish
Historical Review, XLIII (Oct., 1964), 144. The copy is introduced in
the Minutes thus: “The following Letter was read from the late Rector
Mr. Mill in reference to the Essays given in for the Rector’s Prize
during the present Session.” The letter is followed by this note: “The
Essay bearing the motto quaere verum was found to be the production of
Mr. W. Horne Student of Philosophy in the 4th Year.” The subject JSM had
set for the competition was “To explain and illustrate the principle of
Inseparable Association and its applications to the theory of more
complex mental operations.”

2.
This was the third prize of £25 that JSM had awarded for essays on
subjects assigned by him. The first had been “The Sources of Fallacious
Thinking, and of Opinion insufficiently grounded in fact, which lie in
the original Constitution of the Human Mind; and on any modes of
fortifying the Mind against the tendencies thus arising.” The second
topic had been “The Logical and Psychological Questions involved in the
Controversy between Nominalism and Realism; and on any Remains of
Realism in the Schools of the present day.” See Rectorial Addresses
Delivered at the University of St Andrews . . . 1863-1893, ed. W. Knight

distributed free to all those Watson could find who owned his earlier
work, Cybele Britannica (4 vols., London, 1847-59). After 1870 the
Compendium, which superseded Cybele, was sold in the usual way. Both
Watson and JSM were contributors to the botanical journal, The
Phytologist.

Watson had written: “Advergence would better express my idea than does
Convergence; but it is a form not in use, & so avoided. I am strongly
imbued with the notion that here is the real counterpoise, at once to
limit and to complete the Darwinian theory. It would seem that your own
leaning is also that way; which could hardly be unless you had already
felt a want of completeness & a want of check or counterbalance in the
theory, as it is put forth by Darwin, & is blindly belauded by Converted
Zealots of the weathercock type like Dr. Hooker.”

3.
Watson: “Fully I concur with you in not thinking it an objection
‘against Darwin’s theory,’ that it does not even hypothetically resolve
the question of the first origin of life. My objection against it is
just the other way; namely that he has made an origin in one or two
types a part of the theory, without a tittle of evidence in support
thereof;—& that he has adopted a misleading title, in pretending to
account for the origin of species by means of natural selection. Read
his title with the change of the one fatal word, as ‘The Formation of
Species by means of’ etc. This is the real thing. New species are formed
out of older species by the natural agency. But Darwin wanted an ad
captandum book-title; & I doubt whether the falseness of the one
selected was clearly known by him.”

Fawcett had written: “I am very anxious to know what you think of Mr
Gladstone’s scheme for the appropriation of the Revenues of the Irish
Church. I have rather a strong opinion that too much is given to the
landlords; the tithes are offered to them on most favourable terms, & a
great portion of the £200,000 per annum given to the County Cess [rates]
must ultimately go into their pockets. Do you think it would be
advisable when the Bill is in Committee to make an attempt to get
something for Irish education? £60,000 a year, might, with great
advantage, be given to the Queen’s Colleges, & a considerable sum might,
most beneficially, be devoted to the establishment of secondary schools.

The plan of the Metaphysical Society was first conceived by James, later
Sir James Knowles (1831-1908), Charles Pritchard (1808-1893), and Alfred
Tennyson in Nov., 1868; the aim was “to bring together all shades of
religious and theological opinion, from the Roman Catholic to the
Unitarian, in an effort to counteract scientific materialism and unite
warring theological factions as much as possible in a common cause.”
Alan Willard Brown, The Metaphysical Society (New York, 1947), p. 21.

3.
Ward (William George Ward, p. 298) had written: “Certain Theists, who
feel very strongly what they consider the evils more and more impending
from such views as you, Mr. Bain, and others so ably advocate, are
extremely desirous of promoting direct and personal discussion on the
subject. They are of opinion, rightly or wrongly, that those on your
side do not duly weigh what is said on ours, and that good of various
kinds would ensue from a closer personal rapprochement.”

Gladstone had first proposed his bill for the disestablishment and
disendowment of the Irish Church on March 1; the bill provided that the
property of the Church of Ireland “should be held and applied for the
advantage of the Irish people, but not for the maintenance of any Church
or clergy . . . nor for the teaching of religion.” Some of the

See Letter 1418, n. 7. Cairnes in his letter of April 13 had remarked:
“I fully admit the force of what you have urged on the subject of the
Irish Church bill; and, if the application of the funds to education
would necessitate an immediate dealing with the education question, I
acknowledge the consideration would be decisive. But this is what I do
not see. As at present enlightened, it appears to me that the settlement
of the Church question might have been kept distinct from the disposal
of the property, which might have been temporarily invested pending the
time when Parliament should have made up its mind on the principle on
which Irish educational institutions should be remodeled. . . . During
this time the fund might be made useful to facilitate the settlement of
the land question by affording advances on easy terms to tenants
desirous of purchasing their farms.”

Daniel O’Sullivan, mayor of Cork and a Fenian supporter, was the target
of a bill introduced on May 5, 1869, by the Attorney General for
Ireland. It was proposed to disable O’Sullivan from holding any office
in Ireland because of his seditious language and activities. The second
reading of the bill was deferred to June 8, and was then withdrawn. See
Hansard, CXCVI, cols. 185-244, 575-84. JSM in Letter 1437 reports that
the bill has been dropped even earlier.

2.
Beginning in the spring of 1868 the Government had been seeking to
suppress Bradlaugh’s The National Reformer under the Act of 60 Geo. III,
cap. 69 which had been enacted in 1819 to eliminate cheap democratic and
freethought publications. Bradlaugh’s resistance to prosecution aroused
liberal opinion, and a bill introduced in the Commons on April 22, 1869,
by A. S. Ayrton to repeal the Act was adopted on April 26 and in the
House of Lords on June 21. For a detailed account of the matter see
chap. xiv, “The ‘National Reformer’ and its Government Prosecutions” in
Hypatia Bonner, Charles Bradlaugh, I, 137-51. See also Letter 1293.

necessary to suppress the rebellion.

JSM was mistaken; the author of The Elements of Social Science, or
physical, sexual, and natural religion, first published in London in
1854, was Dr. George R. Drysdale (1825-1904). It was republished in many
large editions, always anonymously (until the 35th edition [1905], which
the British Museum Catalogue lists under the name of the author). It
also sold widely in German and French translations. D’Eichthal probably
had referred to the French translation which appeared in 1869, from the
seventh edition (London, 1867).

Charles Robert Drysdale (1829-1907), the brother of George Drysdale, was
also a physician; he wrote on medical topics, social aspects of
prostitution, and the population question, including an essay on The
population question according to T. R. Malthus and J. S. Mill (London,

Hamilton’s interpretation of Aristotle, Professor Veitch has convicted

Bain had written that his first impression was “that the premises
contended for as to women’s aptitudes are larger than the conclusion
required. It is obvious that there are two stages in the adjustment of
the problem of women: the first is political and points merely to the
removal of restrictions; the second is private, referring to the
exercise of individual discretion in embarking upon the wide sea of
occupations, wherein men have hitherto had the monopoly.” Bain was
especially concerned about the problem of women’s education for the
higher professions, particularly medicine.

The Subjection of Women.

3.
Nichol had written: “I must confess that my own limited experience has
not found the administrative ability in women that is spoken of & I
don’t derive much encouragement from the example of sovereigns. Kings
are perhaps superfluous in highly civilized countries but, with very few
exceptions, have not Queens been for a longer period either superfluous
or worse? It is difficult to read Mr Motley’s volumes or the more
reluctant testimony of Mr Froude & preserve much admiration for the
character of Elizabeth. . . .”

Robertson had written (in part): “Upon the argument of Ch. 3, that women
as they are best correct what is excessive, & best apply what is good,
in the speculation of men, might not an opponent argue, that is would be
a pity thus to destroy this balance of the mutual forces? If women
fulfil so important a function because, being not trained as men, they
are what they are, would they not, if trained as men (which is the
object of the argument), fall into the errors of men & all alike, men
and women, henceforth be uncontrolled? The argument of this chapter
seems to me a very delicate one. . . . In such an argument it is
difficult to hold the balance even: to ascribe enough and not to ascribe
too much to women as they are; in placing them under men as regards
certain kinds of achievement, to show that there is no proof of their
inferior faculty for these, without claiming for them what must amount
to special superiority of a different kind. I suspect that the only true
way out of the difficulty is to declare that if men have needed help
from women as women are, it is because they, the men, have not been
properly trained; is to attest, that, by throwing down the barriers
before women, in all probability the type of mental action to which the
one sex would henceforth not be debarred from approaching more than the
other, would be a better type than the favoured sex has hitherto sought
or been able to attain to. . . .”

On a holiday spent in Belgium, Holland, and western Germany. Thornton
had spent a good deal of time observing peasant properties.

3.
Thornton had written: “I wish I could think that the small farmers in
North Holland—between the Helder and Alkmaar—are proprietors of their
own farms—I do not know whether they are or not—but if they are it would
be they that we should cite in confirmation of our theories. They
realize my ideal even better I think than the Channel Islanders. . . .”

4.
Thornton had commented at some length on the low standard of physical
comfort in rural housing. “This miserable mode of living really proves
nothing but a very low standard of comfort, for the peasants who are
thus lodged have very likely twenty head of cattle & sheep in
proportion, and one farmer’s widow who in one case was pointed out as
the greatest proprietress, and whose dress & skin were worse than those
of the dirtiest of English charwomen, was we were told worth 60000
florins—or between £5 & 6000 in cash. . . .”

5.
Thornton: “Almost the only book I had with me was the first vol. of
Carlyle’s French Revolution which I had scarcely looked at since I first
read it nearly twenty years ago, I suppose. Some time ago I heard [Frank
Harrison] Hill of the Daily News say that Carlyle was to be read at one
period of every one’s life, but that as one matured, that period passed
and did not return. If this be correct I am myself very far from
maturity, for I think I enjoy Carlyle—his French Revolution, that
is—more if possible than ever. He irritates me every now and then by his
perversity . . . but I think him almost without an equal for his
specialty of placing in the strongest light the hidden meaning of
familiar truths. . . .”

These Acts, adopted in 1864, 1866, and 1869, empowered the police in
towns where there were military establishments to round up for enforced
medical inspection women suspected of prostitution. Two organizations
had been founded in 1869 to agitate for repeal of the Acts: the National
Association for the Abolition of State Regulation of Vice, and the
Ladies’ National Association, which was headed by Mrs. Josephine Butler.
A “Women’s Manifesto,” directed against the Acts and signed by two

reported that Lecky considered prostitution a necessity and thought it
could not be eradicated.

3.
Lecky had written of the prostitute: “Herself the supreme type of vice,
she is ultimately the most efficient guardian of virtue. But for her,
the unchallenged purity of countless happy homes would be polluted. . .
. On that one degraded and ignoble form are concentrated the passions
that might have filled the world with shame. She remains, while creeds
and civilisations rise and fall, the eternal priestess of humanity,
blasted for the sins of the people.” (History of European Morals, II,

The pertinent clause of the Programme adopted was No. V: “To promote a
policy of Encouragement to Co-operative Agriculture, through the
purchase by the State, from time to time, of Estates which are in the
market, and the Letting of them, under proper regulations, to such
Co-operative Associations, as afford sufficient evidence of spontaneity
and promise of efficiency.”

3.
Thomas George Snell in 1868 had been Chairman of the Central Liberal
Committee for Chelsea. On Feb. 27, 1880, he wrote to Helen Taylor (MS at
LSE): “In 1869 I inaugurated a movement for the admission of Working
Class Representatives to the House of Commons. These meetings were held
at my house, 13 Holland Park Road, Kensington, each of which Mr Mill
attended.” For ten years Snell was a member of the Vestry and Board of
Trustees of the Parish of Kensington. In 1870 he was the Radical
candidate to represent Chelsea on the London School Board.

4.
Dilke had written: “Fawcett has decided to refuse to join the Committee
formed by Mr. Snell at the meeting at which we were present. He does
this upon the ground that if the Committee receives any such support as
to give it an appearance of some strength it will probably end in our
being committed by persons over whom we have no control of a Policy of
which we cannot approve. I feel myself that with you at Avignon and
those of us who are in the House too busy to attend there would be a
considerable danger that Snell might deliver us into the hands of Glyn
[presumably George G. Glyn, the chief Liberal whip], not because he
founded the movement with the intention of so doing, but because his end
is very far short of ours. . . .

“In reference to the Land [and Labour] League, Fawcett says that he
cannot join in the proposed programme on account of the suggestion which
is involved in several of the paragraphs that co-operation shall be
carried on under the control of Government. . . . It might for the
present be advisable to narrow our task to the assertion and
demonstration of the principle that the community should receive the
benefit of what may be called the accidental increase of rents. Upon
this point we should carry with us both Fawcett and the working men.”

The Women’s Disabilities Bill had passed its second reading on May 4 by
a vote of 124 to 91. Before the Bill went into committee on May 12, the
Government exerted pressure to crush it, and on the division for going
into committee the vote was 220 against and 94 in favour.

3.
By contrast, Dilke’s letter had been pessimistic: “Since our defeat on
women’s suffrage I have begun to think that it is not clear that we
should not do better to go for universal suffrage than for the admission
of widows and spinsters arbitrarily selected [by a property
qualification]. I doubt our carrying this bill for a great time—now that
we have once been well beaten—because there is no force at the back of
the movement except that of justice, which in this country is not worth
much except in the long run. I almost think we could, with the force
which would be at the back of universal suffrage, carry it just as
soon.”

Dilke reported that the Cobden Club was planning to sponsor another
volume of essays for Jan., 1872, this time on International Relations.

With reference to the progress of Forster’s Education Bill, Dilke had
written: “Vernon Harcourt has given notice that on the motion for going
into committee on the Education Bill he shall move a resolution
declaring that ‘provision should be made under the control of the
Education Department to [require] that in all schools assisted by public
rates such religious teaching as may be given therein should be
undenominational in its character and confined to unsectarian
instruction in the Bible.’ ”

Harcourt, convinced that the secularists could not defeat the
denominationalists, had chosen to fall back upon a second line of
defence by proposing undenominational instruction in the Bible. See his
letter to Dilke, published in Stephen Gwynn and G. M. Tuckwell, Life of
Sir Charles W. Dilke (2 vols., New York, 1917), I, 95.

3.
Chauncey Wright (1830-1875), American mathematician and philosopher.

Norton had quoted from a letter to him by Wright of March 21, 1870, the
following passage: “Looked at from the utilitarian point of view, the
rights of private ownership, (the protection of the individual in the
possession, accumulation, consumption, administration, & posthumous
disposal of his surplus gains), are founded simply and solely in the
motives they afford to his making such gains as shall be, in spite of
his seeming private appropriation of them, an addition to the store of
public wealth.” Wright’s letter to Norton is published in Letters of
Chauncey Wright, ed. James B. Thayer (Cambridge, Mass., 1878), pp.
169-75.

Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913), naturalist, who in an essay sent to
Charles Darwin in 1858 anticipated the idea of natural selection as the
method of evolution advanced by Darwin in The Origin of Species (1859).

Wallace records (p. 253) that on reading his attack on private property
in his Malay Archipelago (1869) JSM had written to him from Avignon on
May 19, 1870, enclosing the programme of his proposed Land Tenure Reform
Association and inviting Wallace to become a member of the General
Committee. Wallace accepted the invitation and became active in the
cause; eventually he became president of the Land Nationalization
Society. Wallace records that on the Sunday following this letter he
dined at JSM’s home at Blackheath Park with Helen Taylor, George Grote,
and Auberon Herbert.

Bain had written of a report that the Medical School of the College of
Surgeons, Edinburgh, was to be opened to women, without any
restrictions. “This move, however, will be effectually frustrated if the

For many years under sentence of death and in exile, Mazzini had been
included in the general amnesty of 1866. Earlier in 1870 he had set out
for Sicily, but was arrested at sea off Palermo on Aug. 14 and
imprisoned at Gaeta. Fears for his life were aroused among his friends,
among whom Peter Taylor had long been numbered. Taylor in his letter of
Aug. 21 had urged JSM as one who could speak with authority to protest
on Mazzini’s behalf, perhaps by a letter to The Times. In the event,
Mazzini was released in Oct., and returned to exile.

3.
Taylor seems to have plotted a rescue of Mazzini which somehow fell
through. Emilie Venturi, friend of the Taylors, did journey to Gaeta to
visit Mazzini.

Hennessey in his letter of Aug. 25 as President of the Land and Labour
League had invited JSM to attend a public meeting to be held within a
fortnight to protest against England’s being brought into the war on the
Continent, to call for the abolition of standing armies, “and to demand
that all able-bodied men in the country shall have a thorough military

Hennessey has been identified only as a tailor and an Irish trade
unionist active in a number of left-wing organizations. He and his
associates very soon abandoned their stand for neutrality and called for
English recognition of the new French republic.

John Westlake (1823-1913), jurist; a co-founder in 1869 of the first
periodical of international law, Revue de Droit Internationale et de
Legislation Comparée; later Whewell Professor of international law at
Cambridge, succeeding Henry Maine.

2.
Westlake had written that he was to give a paper at the Sept. meeting of
the NAPSS at Newcastle-upon-Tyne on “Is it desirable to prohibit the
export of Contraband of War?” (see NAPSS, Transactions for 1870, pp.
109-25). See also Westlake’s “Est-il désirable de prohiber l’exportation
de la contrebande de guerre?” Revue de Droit Internationale, II (1870),
614-35.

3.
Westlake had written: “I feel very gloomy about the probable results of
this war. If the unity of Germany could have been secured by a war
carried on against France under normal circumstances and therefore with
no more success than necessary for that object, I should have rejoiced;
but as France cannot be expected to acquiesce in an extreme humiliation
suffered under exceptional circumstances, & she will not in general want
allies to aid her, I fear that no peace now to be made can be any thing
more than a truce.”

5.
A large deputation organized under the auspices of the Labour
Representation League and consisting of officers and representatives of
about a hundred principal London and provincial Trades Societies had
waited upon the Prime Minister at Downing St. on Sept. 27, 1870. The
deputation urged formal recognition of the new French Republic and
greater activity in behalf of peace by the English government. Gladstone
maintained that the situation in France was too uncertain as yet to
warrant formal recognition. See The Times, Sept. 28, p. 9.

6.
Dilke in his letter had said that the government should be urged “to
declare against the transfer of territory without any consent on the
part of the people being given or sought for.” Germany was demanding the
annexation of Alsace and Lorraine.

David King (1819-1894), Birmingham evangelist and publisher, in debating
with Charles Bradlaugh this year challenged Bradlaugh’s implicit
assumption that JSM approved the controversial Neo-Malthusian work The
Elements of Social Science (see Letter 1440). King wrote JSM for a
statement.

MS draft at Johns Hopkins. Published in Elliot, II, 275-76, as to Jean
Arlès-Dufour. In reply to Arlès-Dufour’s of Sept. 26, MS at Johns
Hopkins, as is also his reply to JSM of Nov. 15.

François Barthélemy Arlès-Dufour, originally Arlès (1797-1872), an early
disciple of Saint-Simon, became a leading businessman at Lyon, active in
government affairs. With Frédéric Passy, he founded, in 1867, the Ligue
Internationale et Permanente de la Paix. After the fall of the second
Empire in Sept., 1870, he wrote letters to Gladstone and John Bright
urging England’s intervention in the Franco-Prussian War. The Times, on
Oct. 19, p. 7, published an “Appeal to England” by Arlès-Dufour, written
from Lyon, Oct. 12. Professor Max Müller of Oxford commented at length
on the letter in “Is Peace Possible?” (ibid., Oct. 25, 1870, p. 12). JSM
had been acquainted with Arlès-Dufour for many years (see Earlier
Letters, p. 90).

2.
The Times, Oct. 26, p. 9, reported on propositions for an armistice made
simultaneously by Lord Lyons at Tours and Lord Augustus Loftus at
Berlin, and on the day of this letter (p. 10) published a dispatch from
its Berlin correspondent dated Oct. 26, on Lord Granville’s “suggestions
respecting an armistice.” Nothing, however, came of these initial peace
feelers.

Published in part in Elliot, II, 277-78. In JSM’s hand but initialled:

2.
Her lecture had been given at Stroud on May 25, 1870, under the auspices
of the Mechanics’ Institute (see Amberley Papers, II, 329-30) and as a
result of Helen Taylor’s persuasion. With the title “The Claims of
Women” it appeared in FR, n.s. IX (Jan., 1871), 95-110.

3.
The following cancelled passage appears in the draft after this opening
clause: “as you seemed to agree with me in thinking well of it & as it
is important not to let pass a good opportunity of occasionally
returning to the charge on the subject of women’s emancipation. Her name
& position are of great use to the cause as may be seen from the attacks
which are continually made on her for her support of it. We should
therefore take all the advantage we can of that support & it will give
me very great pleasure if you will print it in the next number.”

4.
JSM is probably referring to Morley’s editorial, “England and the War,”
in the FR, n.s. VIII (Oct., 1870), 479-88.

Courtney had been a leader-writer for The Times since 1865.

2.
JSM’s letter, under the heading “Mr. Mill on the Treaty of 1856,”
appeared in The Times the next day, Nov. 19, 1870, p. 5. It argued that
Russia’s declaration on Oct. 31 repudiating the neutralization of the
Black Sea as required by the Treaty of Paris (1856) was not a sufficient
ground for England to go to war with Russia. The same day’s Times also
printed a letter on the same subject by James Anthony Froude. The Times
leader for that day (evidently by Courtney), p. 9, attacked JSM’s and
Froude’s positions. JSM’s letter was further attacked by Lord
Shaftesbury (ibid., Nov. 22, p. 3) and Lord Russell (ibid., Nov. 23, p.
3); JSM’s answer to Shaftesbury was published on Nov. 24, p. 3, and was
criticized in a leader of the same day, p. 7. JSM also contributed an
article on the subject, “Treaty Obligations,” to the FR, n.s. VIII
(Dec., 1870), 715-20, reprinted in Dissertations, Brit. ed. IV, 119-29,
Am. ed. V, 131-42. See also Letters 1612, 1613, 1614, and 1616.

The war scare was eventually quieted by a conference, held in London
from Dec., 1870, to March, 1871, which issued a declaration against the
unilateral repudiation of treaties.

Muston had written (trans.): “. . . It seems to me, that, in spite of

whether the laws of logic have more weight in guiding us to the truth,

The issues with which JSM was chiefly to concern himself in his
correspondence with Robertson over the following year with reference to
the split in the woman suffrage movement remain obscure. One wing of the
movement, led by the Manchester group which included Lydia Becker and
Jacob Bright, sought to supplant the London committee of the London
National Society for Women’s Suffrage (with which JSM had been closely
associated since its founding in July, 1867) by setting up a Central
Committee of the National Society for Women’s Suffrage in which the
London Society would be represented but would no longer be dominant. The
agitation led this year to a breaking off of a new “Central Committee”
from the London Society. An important reason for the split was the
desire of JSM and his supporters to avoid linking the women suffrage
movement with the agitation for the repeal of the Contagious Diseases
Acts. JSM strongly favoured the repeal of these Acts but believed that
the cause of women’s suffrage would be seriously injured if it became
involved in the highly controversial movement led by Josephine Butler.
See Letters 1669 and 1680. In 1877, four years after JSM’s death, the
London Committee amalgamated with the Central Committee.

In Aug., 1870, the Germans had laid siege to Strasbourg and for three
nights (Aug. 23-26) heavily bombarded the city. Among the many public
buildings destroyed was the Bibliothèque municipale, with its 200,000
volumes, 5,000 incunabula, and 1,600 manuscripts. Shortly after the
capitulation of Strasbourg on Oct. 5, 1870, the victors launched an
appeal, signed by many German publishers and librarians, for a fund to
rebuild the Library. Committees were formed all over the world to
collect money and books. The new University Library was inaugurated in
1871, but was not installed in a new building until 1895.

Eccarius as secretary to its General Council on May 16, 1871.

2.
Hales had written that a committee had been formed to see whether
something could be done “to stay the brutalities of the Versailles
Government.” On May 31 a meeting of representatives of various
republican and democratic societies in London, convened by the General
Council of the International Working Men’s Association, was held at the
Association Rooms, 256 High Holborn, to consider steps to be taken to
prevent the English Government’s extraditing any French Communist
refugees who might seek refuge in England. This letter by JSM was read
at the meeting. See The Times, June 1, 1871, p. 6, and Daily News of

2.
Cairnes had written: “I remember telling you how much struck I was by a
remark in your Logic to the effect that there was no necessary law of
coexistence, as there are laws of succession. It has since occurred to
me that this is only true of inorganic science, and that in the case of
organisms the presence of certain elements implies the presence or
absence of others. Thus in animals teeth of a certain kind imply a
certain sort of stomach, claws or hoofs as the case may be, and so
forth: so that we may conceive the ‘form’ of an organism in Bacon’s
sense of the word. And similarly, it seems to me, we find necessary laws
of coexistence in the social organism: certain moral conditions implying
certain complementary conditions in the political religious and
aesthetic spheres: indeed this is the meaning of society being organic.
The same law holds very obviously in the economic domain. Given
conditions of productive industry and a given state of rent implies
certain facts as to profits and wages; and vice versa profits and wages
within certain limits determine rent and the productiveness of industry.
These are the sort of relations which I think Comte had in view when he
spoke of the statistical [copyist’s error for statical ?] treatment of
the social science as opposed to the Dynamical; and what my point comes
to is this, that the true analogy for the distinction in question is not
that between statics and dynamics, but that between laws of succession
and laws of coexistence, which distinction runs pretty nearly parallel
with that between the inorganic and organic method of study.”

Quoted from Brace’s letter of July 4.

3.
Brace had written: “Thus far in this country, in recent struggles
between Labor and Capital, Labor has had the advantage—in shortening
hours of work and in keeping up wages—for which I am rejoiced—as
certainly the employing class has had most of the good things of life in
the past. Large fortunes can not be made as easily as once—the gains of
the capitalist being smaller relatively. Working men seem in a very
prosperous condition, though they feel the tariff much.”

4.
The Treaty of Washington, signed on May 8, 1871, provided for four

Sept. 14, 1872.

2.
Letter 1638.

3.
Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, on the same day that he
published JSM’s letter of Jan. 20, 1871, vigorously attacked its
free-trade views: “Mill on Protection,” Feb. 13, 1871, p. 4. Further
attacks were published by the Tribune: “Mill’s Logic,” Feb. 15, p. 4,
and “Intentions in Statesmanship,” Feb. 17, p. 4. Greeley also attacked
this letter of JSM in an editorial in the Tribune, Nov. 20, 1871, p. 4.

Willcox in his article, “A Visit to John Stuart Mill at Avignon,”
Appleton’s Journal, IX (June 14, 1873), 785-88, reported that in reply
to Willcox’s question whether Greeley and Carlyle did not have much in
common, JSM replied that “in intensity of purpose, doggedness of
opinion, sincerity of character, one-sidedness of judgment, and blind
hatred for the higher forms of liberty, they are much alike.” In reply
to Willcox’s question, “But has Carlyle been of any real use in the
world as Greeley has?” JSM replied: “Yes, though he has usually
advocated objectionable ideas, he has been so sincere that he has
compelled sincerity in others. Where he has not convinced people of the
truth of his beliefs, he has forced them to re-examine the grounds of
their own beliefs, and has obliged them to believe much more sincerely,
and thus has accomplished great good. He has materially aided also to
break up a large amount of pretence and imposture.”

Newmarch pointed to four or five Land and Building Societies that had

In Oct., 1871, a great flurry of interest arose in England over the
question of international copyright. In response to a number of letters
to the Editor, The Times on Oct. 14, p. 9, in a leader urged American
acceptance of a copyright law which would protect foreign authors. On
Oct. 20, p. 10, The Times published a reply by William H. Appleton, a
partner in the New York firm of D. Appleton & Co., stating that “an
International Copyright Law, rigorously in the author’s interest,
requiring him to make contracts for American republication directly with
American publishers, and taking effect only with books entirely
manufactured in the United States, would be acceptable to the [American]
people.”

Efforts to pass an international copyright law in the U.S. Congress in
1872 failed as did ten other efforts between 1843 and 1886, and it was
not until 1891 that the American Copyright Acts were passed.

3.
William Appleton drafted a bill incorporating the principles of his
letter to The Times of Oct. 20. A Memorial favouring this bill was

abolished at the end of the war with France. The tax was reinstituted by
Peel in 1842.

Included with this letter at UCL is an undated note (probably the same
date as the note in Letter 1692, n. 4) signed Charlotte A. M. Burbury:
“The Lecture Fund of £500 was fully accounted for by Mr Biggs. When I
became Treasurer the balance then remaining was handed over to me.”

The draft was as follows:

“The Committee much regrets that in consequence of some differences of
opinion, some of its members should not merely have decided to retire
from it, but to establish another Committee: because it is possible that
the mere facts of the existence of the other Committee may in some
quarters give rise to the impression of grave dissensions. So long
however as the new Committee disclaims all hostile feelings and
intentions, and professes merely to desire tooccupy ground different
from that of our Committee, it appears to us that an appeal to the
general body of the subscribers would be calculated to make generally
public differences of opinion which since they must exist, had better,
if possible, be confined to the knowledge of the Executive Bodies and of
such persons only as are intimately acquainted with the working of the
movement.

“Should the new Committee place itself in any degree in a hostile
position towards the original Committee, or take any measures at all
calculated to attract public attention to disagreements of opinion, it
might become the duty of the original Committee to appeal to the general
body of the Society for support. But we are of opinion that it is not
impossible that the two Committees should co-exist without hostile
feeling, working upon different plans undoubtedly but with the same
object: and we think that such a division of labour would be more
consistent with the objects we all have in view, than any concession, on
our part, of the principle upon which we have taken our stand, viz. a
careful avoidance of even apparent mingling of any other agitation with
that which we are engaged in for women’s suffrage. We hold it to be
important that no person conspicuously engaged, either as officer or as
lecturer, in some other agitations now proceeding, to which we will not
further allude, should hold any conspicuous place in the movement for
Women’s Suffrage. In this opinion the founders of the new Committee
totally disagree; in proof of which we have merely to refer to the names
of its Honorary Secretaries. We believe that there are many who will
agree with them, as well as many who will agree with us. We see no
occasion for unfriendly or personal feeling in the matter: but we have
arrived deliberately at the opinion that it would be better that two
Committees should coexist than that one only should exist exposed to the
reasonable dissatisfaction of those friends of Women’s Suffrage strongly
opposed to some other movements now on foot: inasmuch as if there
existed no executive body entirely disconnected with those other
movements,many friends of Women’s Suffrage might find themselves
compelled to withdraw their support.”

He was probably the most acute of JSM’s contemporary critics in both
economics and logic.

Jevons in 1865 had sent JSM a copy of his Pure Logic, or the Logic of
Quality apart from Quantity, with remarks on Boole’s System and on the
Relation of Logic to Mathematics (1864). In a letter of May 8, 1865 (MS
at Johns Hopkins) Jevons upbraided JSM for ignoring Boole’s writings,
particularly on the question of the quantification of the predication in
both the Logic and the Hamilton. Johns Hopkins also has a letter by
Jevons to JSM of March 16, 1868, but no replies by JSM have been

2.
Herbert had written: “They [the working men] seem to me to be singularly
open to plain & simple claims made in the name of what is right—Justice,
truth, toleration are words that have not palled on them, as they have
on the ear of classes who have set fashions of living and thinking and
who shrink from all general ideas that may be larger than these. No one
can fail to be struck with the simplicity of the instincts of our
workmen, like those of children, ready to be guided into good.”

3.
Herbert had delineated the needs of working men as the need “to have
their lives enriched with the interest of some scientific pursuit and
intellectual thought” and the need for “the moral content which comes
from living under a bond to help each other, and trying to make what one
is gaining for oneself of use to others.” He proposed enlisting workmen
into a society which would have as its purpose: “To pursue some science
or art—be it geology, botany, chemistry—be it history or the archæology
of the district in wh. they live—be it the study of architecture or
drawing—and in pursuing it to do so with the object ever present to them
of helping others and teaching again what they can learn themselves. . .
. I feel that the lives of the workmen are without a high and satisfying
moral purpose—yet of this I believe them to be more capable than the
most of us. The simplest remedy seems to me one of the best—to lead them
to develop some one faculty and then to assist others by what they have
learnt; to lead them to form a continually rising conception of moral
obligations; and through such a simple & loose organisation as is
practicable . . . to make them help each other in learning and doing. .

find the way of paying debts for a year. Après moi le déluge, that is
their policy. Still the people understand great interests much better,
and we go forwards slowly, but surely. The work of establishing the
Italian Govt. in Rome is very difficult, and the Italian ministers
succeed with shrewdness, when they have not ideas.”

first letter (n.d.) to JSM, to which this is a reply.

Franz Clemens Brentano (1838-1917), German philosopher; Catholic priest,
1864-73; teacher of philosophy at Würzburg University, 1866-73, and at
Vienna, 1874-80, 1881-95.

2.
Brentano in his letter expressed his debt to JSM for many stimulating
ideas, and for bringing to his attention the work of other English
thinkers, and also of Auguste Comte, all of which gave him new hope for
the state of philosophy. He said, in part (translated): “For philosophy
as taught and practised in Germany for quite some time seems to have
gone astray. . . . From the first I have been speculating how it could
be reformed in the way the natural sciences have been reformed; and I am
happy to say that my own ideas conform to yours in more than one point
regarding the character of inquiries as well as certain doctrines. After
I became acquainted with your writings I began a series of new studies
which, though I had given a good deal of serious thought to them, I had
not felt ready to publish because of what I felt to be their premature
nature.”

Brentano’s “Auguste Comte und die positive Philosophie” had been
published in “Chilianeum”, Blätter für katholische Philosophie, Kunst
und Leben (Neue Folge. Bd. 2, 1869); reprinted in Phasen der Philosophie
(Oskar Kraus, ed.), Philosophische Bibliothek vol. 195 (Leipzig, 1926),

See Letters 868, 872, 904, 1104, 1145, 1248, 1410, and 1418. Morley had
written: “I find myself unable to agree with most of my friends on the
subject of Irish education; of wh. I cannot at all accept Fawcett’s Bill
as any kind of solution. Surely the Irish nation must decide the matter,
and if they choose by a decisive and unmistakable majority to have
Catholic colleges, ought not the state to accept such a desire and place
these colleges in an equally advantageous position with the Queen’s
colleges and Trinity? I don’t mean that denominational teaching is a
thing wh. a government shd. meddle with as a rule, but Ireland is in a
kind of abnormal seventeenth century, and seems to demand a special set
of maxims in a statesman who has to deal with her. Anyhow, I cannot
reconcile it with my conception of national self-government to force the
Irish either to lose the advantages of a degree and an equal chance of
prizes and emoluments, or else to send their sons to places of education
wh. they wholly dislike.”

An undated clipping of a newspaper leader commenting on a speech by the
physicist John Tyndall is with the Yale MS of Arnold’s letter. Tyndall
had spoken on May 4 at an anniversary dinner of the Royal Academy. The
leader read, in part, as follows: “Never again can men think and believe
as they once did. The march of science and of thought has left behind
institutions which are dead without knowing it, and burdens of the human
mind, which seem still borne only because the ache of the place where
they pressed is still felt. . . . But men must have something to
believe, something to explain to them the beauty of Nature as well as
her order and her truth—something to restore to them in the new world
opening outside the little old-fashioned universe their faith in a
Source of all that beauty, and in a Centre of all that love and worship,
the endless insatiable hope and aspiration which will not be satisfied
with ‘force and matter.’ The cry of humanity today to the men of science
is, ‘Give us back something to believe,’ in return for that which has
been taken away. Science ought not to respond with a cold refusal to
care for anything but facts. Emotions, affections, aspirations, as
Professor Tyndall himself said, are ‘part and parcel’ of human nature;
and there must be a religion—there must be a morality and a creed—to
satisfy such desires.”

2.
Cairnes had been working on his theory of value, later published as Part
I of his Some Leading Principles of Political Economy Newly Expounded
(London, 1874). Cairnes had questioned JSM’s definition of “Demand” as
“quantity demanded” in Pol. Econ., Book III, chap 2, “Of Demand and
Supply in their Relation to Value”; and his conception of “Cost of
Production” set forth in Pol. Econ., Book III, chap. 4, “Ultimate
Analysis of Cost of Production.” His disagreement with JSM on these
points is set forth in Some Leading Principles, Part I, chaps. 2 and 3.

3.
Cairnes, in his letter of May 2, had noted that Jacob Bright’s bill for
women’s suffrage had been defeated on its second reading on May 1 by a
larger margin than in the previous year, and that “in one case a vote
was lost by the association of the subject with the C.D. Acts.”

4.
See Letter 1694.

5.
The following passage appears only in the MS draft: “The success which
the movement had during the four years that it was mainly under my
daughter’s guidance was due to the care with which it was kept
disconnected from anything vulgar, fussy, pushing. Under the original
management to keep it clear from all these associations was a sine qua
non. But when it began to be thought that credit & consequence might be
gained by means of this movement the sort of people who had not thought
of doing anything before pushed their way in. My daughter’s ill health
leaving the way open to Mrs Taylor’s visible weakness, the Jacob Brights
and their set have become prominent in London & have already thrown back
the question into that refrain of feminine contempt & ridicule out of
which it was raised a few years ago.”

6.
Bright in his speech in the Commons on May 1 had said in part: “There is
nothing at this moment but the consciences of women standing between
this country and a gigantic system of prostitution supported and
controlled by the State. . . . Having no part in the election of Members
of Parliament, women have failed to exert their full influence upon the
question. . . . The legislation to which I have been referring has given
an impulse to the movement in favour of women’s suffrage greater than it
has received from any other cause.” Hansard, CCXI, col. 8.

The following paragraph is in the MS draft but not in the letter sent:
“You may be sure that we shall not be long in London without going to
see you & Mrs Cairnes. It will however be some time before we have that
pleasure as our journey in the Alps during the last months stands
instead of our usual summer sojourn in England, & we propose passing the
autumn at Avignon as usual & not returning to England this year. One of
the poor points in this plan which are not pleasant to us is that we
shall in consequence be longer before seeing you.”

5.
Cairnes had commented thus on E. A. Freeman’s The Growth of the English
Constitution from the Earliest Times (London, 1872): “The grand point
insisted on in the first two chapters is the high credit due to
Englishmen from the fact that their Constitution has been a growth, that
nothing has been done in deference to theory. If sometimes a remedy has
been sought for a practical evil Englishmen have been careful never to
look beyond the particular evil. How unlike Frenchmen, always recasting
their Constitution in conformity with some abstract theory! Now is it
not vexatious to find an able man like Freeman lending his authority to
the diffusion of such rubbish, and doing his utmost to strengthen the
particular mental perversities that stand most in the way of all
progressive improvement?”

The address, in an unidentified hand, is enclosed in the letter: “The
Executive Committee of the London National Society for Women’s Suffrage
has after much deliberation come to a resolution, which it desires to
submit to you as charged of late years with the conduct of the W[omen’s]
D[isabilities] B[ill] in parliament. The resolution is, that in the next
session, and until the assembling of a new House of Commons, it is
expedient to refrain from re-introducing the Bill.

“The Committee is far from being discouraged by the actual position of
the question before the public. In the constituencies the progress made
is quite as great as could be hoped for and the prospects are
encouraging. In parliament also, though not as rapidly as at first,
there has been steady advance, to which the less favourable division of
last session was a check more apparent than real. But the Committee
cannot close its eyes to the fact that by the present House of Commons
the question has been definitively judged and judged adversely. It is
vain to hope for any division so much more favourable as to have any
practical effect in determining the question; while through accident or
caprice a serious reverse, or what could plausibly be interpreted as
such, might on the next occasion be experienced. In the opinion of the
Committee it would be wise, so far as the existing parliament is
concerned, to rest content with the signal progress that has already
been made, and the most effective course in the immediate future is to
bend all efforts towards enlightening the constituencies from which a
new parliament must soon receive its mandate.

“Supporters of Women’s Suffrage, in proportion to their conviction that
upon all grounds of reason their case has been made out, must be aware
that henceforth it is chiefly a social prejudice which they have to
overcome. Now the worst way of surmounting a sentimental or wilful
resistance is to resort to an importunate advocacy. Our opponents, in
their entrenched position, are exceedingly powerful, and are least
likely to give ground, if they are incessantly being faced to no purpose
in parliament. When they see that the friends of W[omen’s] S[uffrage],
without bating a jot of their purpose or their activity, are content to
bide their time, and, foiled in one direction, turn into the other which
leads more surely, if less directly, to the goal, those who have decided
the movement as transient and not serious may begin to discover their
mistake.”

paraphrased in his Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkt, Buch 2, Kap.
7 (vol. 193 of Philosophische Bibliothek [Leipzig, 1925]), pp. 60-62.

2.
Brentano had written (translated): “A number of ultra-montane zealots
got busy to decry me as an atheist, just as they had decried M. Comte at
one time,—though with even less justification; the only basis for their
accusations was that I were no faithful follower of Christianity, and
maybe that I mentioned your name and the names of other adherents of the
school of exact sciences in my lectures more often than they liked. They
tried to instigate the students against me, but were unsuccessful in
this; my lectures continued to be among the most popular ones at the
university; but I have had a great deal of vexation which brought on
severe nervous headaches that afflict me day and night.”

Brentano attracted a great following of students at Würzburg by his
novel approach, applying strict scientific methods in the study of
philosophy, as opposed to the mystical-speculative methods of the
dominant school of German philosophers. As a consequence, Church and
faculty denounced him as an atheist. In 1873 he renounced his
priesthood, though not his catholicism, and resigned his professorship
at Würzburg. From 1874 to 1880 he taught at the University of Vienna.

MS in the Westminster Public Library, London, in a portfolio entitled
“Correspondence relating to the portrait of John Stuart Mill.” Second
paragraph published in M. S. Watts, George Frederic Watts (3 vols.,
London, 1912), I, 273.

Dilke, a great admirer of JSM, had arranged with the prominent painter
George Frederic Watts (1817-1904) to do a portrait of JSM if he could be
persuaded to sit for it. JSM’s consent, recorded in this letter,
resulted in the painting of the most widely known portrait of him, the
copy exhibited in the National Portrait Gallery in London. The original
portrait, which for years hung in the Westminster City Hall, has been
stored in the basement of that building, almost opposite the National
Portrait Gallery, since the building of the new City Hall in Victoria
Street.

The correspondence about the portrait was assembled by Dilke when he
arranged in 1905 to bequeath the original to the City of Westminster.
The correspondence reveals that Dilke paid Watts £315 for the painting.
The first sitting to Watts appears to have occurred on March 17, 1873,
and according to Dilke the portrait was delivered to his home on the day
of JSM’s death.

In a letter of July 14, 1905, to the Town Clerk of Westminster, Dilke in
expressing his intent to bequeath the original portrait to the City of
Westminster summarized the later history of the painting: “Watts asked
my leave to paint the replica, and after this was finished I had both in
my possession for a considerable time, during which they were seen by
the friends of Mill, and Watts having given me my choice, I chose, on
the advice of Mill’s friends, the original painted from life. The two
portraits are, however, very similar, and there is much difficulty in
distinguishing them apart. The one which you will inherit is that which
was exhibited at the Royal Academy Exhibition, & which has subsequently
been shown at various exhibitions, down to but not including the Watts
Exhibition of 1905. At this exhibition of the present year the replica
from the National Portrait Gallery was that exhibited: and I put these
facts on record because the “Times” reviewer of the Exhibitionof 1905
assumed that the portrait exhibited in 1905 was the same which he had
previously seen at other exhibitions.”

The copy given to the National Portrait Gallery by Watts was completed
by August 3, 1873, for on that date the painter invited Sir Charles and
Lady Dilke to his studio to see the copy side by side with the original.
In a letter of March 1, 1906, to Captain Herbert M. Jessel, MP, Dilke
claimed that it is “the only portrait for which Mill ever sat and the
only portrait executed during his life by anyone.” [But see Frontispiece
to Vol. XVI of Collected Works.] Dilke also wrote Jessel that Watts
“concurred in my judgment that apart from interest the original picture
was the better of the two—though I do not know that I expressed that
opinion. All I said was that I preferred to keep it.” Richard Ormond of
the staff of the National Portrait Gallery concurs in Dilke’s
preference, describing it as “a much stronger and more vital
characterization.”

Watts reserved the copyright on the painting. It was subsequently
engraved by M. Paul Adolphe Rajon (1843-1888), French draughtsman and
etcher who after 1865 made annual visits to England to do engravings.
The painting and the engraving are described in an appreciative
criticism by Philip G. Hamerton, “Portrait of John Stuart Mill,”
Portfolio, VI (1875), ii, and reproduced in R. J. Wickenden, “Paul
Adolphe Rajon,” Print Collector’s Quarterly, VI (1916), 411-34.
According to Wickenden, it was Rajon’s first great success; publishing
it himself, he made £600 by it in a few months, and it remained a
constant source of income for the rest of his life.

translated in Packe, p. 506.

Jean Henri Fabre (1823-1915), later the internationally known
entomologist. From 1852 to 1871 he had been a teacher of science in the
lycée at Avignon, but lost his position there because of clerical
agitation against him for admitting girls to science classes. During his
troubles JSM assisted him financially. Before making a permanent
settlement at Sérignan, Fabre lived for a time near Orange.

1.
MS draft at LSE. Published in translation in Packe, pp. 506-507.

This appears to be the last letter written by JSM. On Saturday, May 3,
he and Fabre made a fifteen-mile botanizing expedition. After returning
to Avignon, JSM caught a chill, and by Monday was running a fever. The
local physician. Dr. Chauffard, diagnosed the illness as erysipelas, and
telegraphed Dr. Cecil Gurney of Nice to come at once. Gurney arrived on
Tuesday but could do nothing. JSM died at 7 a.m. on Wednesday, May 7,
1873. It is reported that just before his death he murmured to Helen,
“You know that I have done my work.”

1.
The original has not been located. Quoted in a letter of June 6, 1828,
by Wirgman to Henry Brougham, MS at UCL.

Wirgman’s letter, dated from Timberham Lodge nr Crawley, Sussex, begins:
“By this day’s post I am favored with a letter from my favite [sic]
pupil and excellent and keen reasoner Mr John Mill those parts which
relate to the treatise I had the honor to prepare for the ‘Society of
Useful Knowledge.’ I have taken the liberty to send you a copy of
Extract of a letter from Mr John Mill to Mr T Wirgman.” In what sense
JSM was a “pupil” of Wirgman is not known.

Thomas Wirgman (1769-1840), by vocation a jeweller, by avocation a
disciple of Immanuel Kant; the most prolific English writer on Kant in
his generation; author of Principles of the Kantesian or Transcendental
Philosophy (Principes de la Philosophie etc) (English and French,
London, 1824), and other works. For the fullest account of Wirgman, see
René Wellek, Immanuel Kant in England, 1793-1838 (Princeton, 1931),
chap. 5. Wellek gives his dates as 1777-1840; ours are based on the
entry of Wirgman’s death in the Gentleman’s Magazine, n.s. XV (Feb.,
1841) p. 215, and in The Times, Jan. 1, 1841, p. 8.

Wirgman at this point and for some years tried unsuccessfully to get the
Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge to publish his “Account of
the Philosophy of Kant.” As a later letter to Brougham at UCL indicates,
he thought that James Mill was responsible for blocking the publication.

“The Church and its Reform,” London Rev., I (July, 1835), 257-95. The
article, signed P.Q., was by JSM’s father, James Mill. A few excerpts
indicate the nature of his remarks on prayer (p. 262):

“The tendency of the Church of England prayers is to give a wrong notion
of the Divine attributes; and instead of the idea of a Being of perfect
wisdom and goodness, to present the ideas of a being very imperfect in
both. . . . Perpetually to be asking God for things which we want,
believing that this is a way to obtain them, implies the belief that God
is imperfect both in wisdom and goodness. . . .

“In like manner in regard to praise . . . : first, what use can there be
in our telling the Divine Being, that he has such and such qualities; as
if he was like to mistake his own qualities, by some imperfection in his
knowledge, which we supply? next, what a mean and gross conception of
the Divine nature is implied in supposing that, like the meanest of men,
God is delighted in listening to his own praises! . . .

“The Divine Author of our religion every where indicates his opinion,
that praying is nothing but a ceremony. . . .”

2.
No such article appeared in the July, 1836, LWR. JSM apparently did not
write on the British intervention in the Spanish civil war provoked by
the pretender Don Carlos until the following year, when he contributed a
part of the article “The Spanish Question,” LWR, XXVII (July, 1837),
165-94, signed T.E. The article contains a letter by Col. Napier. JSM
defended the intervention.

3.
In 1835, England, departing from its usual non-intervention policy,
suspended its Foreign Enlistment Act to permit the Spanish government to
raise a British Legion for service against the Carlist forces. The
Legion was commanded by Sir George de Lacy Evans (1787-1870), veteran of
the Peninsular War.

2.
As is evident in Letter 183, JSM had been asked by Molesworth for advice
in the writing of his article on “Terms of Alliance between Radicals and
Whigs,” which appeared in the next number of the LWR, XXVI (Jan., 1837),
279-318.

3.
Charles Buller had attacked the Established Church Reform Bill on its
third reading, July 19, 1836 (see Hansard, XXXV, cols. 350-52).

4.
Reform of the Church of Ireland was a perennial goal of radicals and
many liberals until the final disestablishment of the Church in 1869.

5.
Fonblanque, though sharing many of the Philosophical Radicals’ views,
had become increasingly critical of their tactics. JSM’s complimentary
footnote was published in Molesworth’s “Terms of Alliance” article, p.
283.

The compliment had its effect, for a letter of Fonblanque to Lord Durham
excepted Molesworth from the other extreme radicals who gathered under
John Roebuck at Bath early in Jan., 1837, and tried to shake the Whig
ministry. On Jan. 2, 1837, Fonblanque wrote Durham: “The main body of
the Radicals disapprove of the course taken by the mutineers who are
very few though very noisy; Sir W. Molesworth is the only one of them
whose motives I believe to be pure, and he is instigated by Mrs. Grote,
who is unfortunately more of a man, but not a better man, than her
husband. The notion of Mrs. Grote’s little party seems to be that the
perfection of Radicalism is the fiercest hostility to the Whigs—the
number of those madcaps is, however, hardly half a dozen in Parliament
at present. . . .” (Lambton MSS.) In the same letter Fonblanque
indicated that he was “rather inclined to approve” the “plan of Radical
operation” set forth in Molesworth’s article. For JSM’s later
differences with Fonblanque on the Radicals, see Earlier Letters, Nos.
231, 233, 234, 235.

Macaulay had gone to India in 1834 as a member of its supreme council,
on which he served until 1838. He concerned himself there chiefly with
the drafting of a new penal code and of a new system of national
education, both of which were eventually adopted. It was Macaulay’s
famous Minute of Feb. 2, 1835, on Indian education (printed in part in
Speeches by Lord Macaulay, with his Minute on Indian Education, ed. G.
M. Young [Oxford, 1935], pp. 345-61), that aroused JSM’s scorn. The
Minute was an eloquent plea for substituting English for Arabic and
Sanskrit as the language for instruction. Lord William Bentinck, the
governor-general of India, notified the East India Co. that such a
policy was to be followed in the future. For a study of the opposition
in the Company to this policy, see K. A. Ballhatchet, “The Home
Government and Bentinck’s Educational Policy,” Cambridge Historical
Journal, X, No. 2 (1951), pp. 224-29.

3.
JSM in his draft of a despatch on the “Recent Changes in Native
Education” expressed the opinion of the directors of the Company in
condemning the new measures and calling for a restoration of the
previous system while at the same time encouraging the study of English.
JSM wrote that it was “altogether chimerical to expect that the main
portion of the mental cultivation of a people can take place through the
medium of a foreign language. . . . It is through the vernacular
languages only that instruction can be diffused among the people; but
the vernacular languages can only be rendered adequate to this purpose
by persons who can introduce into them from the Sanskrit or the Arabic
the requisite words and terms of expression. . . . What we may hope to
do by means of English tuition is to teach the teachers; to raise up a
class of persons who having derived from an intimate acquaintance with
European literature the improved ideas and feelings which are derivable
from that source will make it their occupation to spread those ideas and
feelings among their countrymen” (excerpts quoted by Ballhatchet, p.
226). The draft was approved by the “Chairs” and submitted to the board
of control in Oct., 1836. See also Abram L. Harris, “John Stuart Mill:
Servant to the East India Company,” Canadian Journal of Economics and
Political Science, XXX (May, 1964), pp. 185-202.

Napier in his article on Wellington (pp. 398-99) warned against the
menace of Russia to both Europe and India: “We hear a great deal of the
innate weakness of Russia; we see her wickedness, and we know her
ambition: but we are told that she has no money; that it is impossible
for her to invade India; that she cannot march her large armies into
Europe. Strange infatuation! These are the paradoxes of folly, to cover
the want of provident energy.”

5.
In commenting on Wellington (then Sir Arthur Wellesley) and his first
campaign as commander-in-chief in India to quell a revolt led by
Dhoondiah Waugh, a Marhatta adventurer, Napier referred (ibid., p. 386)
with heavy irony to the activities of the East India Company: “For this
he [Dhoondiah] was to be hanged on the nearest tree, and by whom? By the
general of the East India Company of merchants; a company whose power
and empire, in the native country of Dhoondiah Waugh, was no doubt
commenced and established with the most perfect regard to justice and
decorum. No undue ambition, no love of lucre, no base unworthy acts, no
ravages, no murders had ever marked the career of the Honourable
Company. All was fair, just, wise, moderate, and religious in their
advancement, from a licensed counting house on the coast to the absolute
dominion of the East.”

A long note in Book I, chap. vii, expanding upon Bentham’s attack on the
use of such terms as “Law of nations, moral sense, common sense,
understanding, rule of right, fitness of things, law of reason, right
reason, natural justice, natural equity, good order, truth, will of God,
repugnancy to nature.” JSM’s note ended thus: “The moralists, or
pretended moralists, who make use of these words, may be said to belong
to the dogmatical school of ethics: since they give their own
approbation or disapprobation, as a reason for itself, and a standard
for the approbation or disapprobation of every one else. This
appellation will distinguish them from those who think that morality is
not the province of dogmatism, but of reason, and that propositions in
ethics need proof, as much as propositions in mathematics.”

The note, substantially as suggested here, was published at the
beginning of the article (p. 367): “Some of our readers may recollect
the tone of the Whigs towards the Duke some years ago. A leading article
of the ‘Morning Chronicle,’ in Perry’s day, began somewhat in this
style: ‘The Duke of Wellington’s head is continually thrust into our
faces; at every corner we meet it in plaister, looking as empty and as
dull as emptiness and dulness can make the original look!’ We would ask
also, whether Mr Barry O’Meara, the friend of the Whigs, had not in his
possession Napoleon’s detailed and highly favourable opinions of the
Duke of Wellington’s campaigns, and refrained from publishing them
because they would do him too much honour? We heard this from a
gentleman who assured us that he had it from Mr O’Meara himself.”

MS draft at LSE. Bears note in JSM’s hand: To Arthur Helps / date
unknown. (I suppose the draft in pencil was the one sent.)

JSM had reviewed two earlier works by Helps (see Earlier Letters, p.
322, n. 2, and p. 643, n. 2). This time JSM had evidently been requested
to read proofs of Helps’s Friends in Council: a Series of Readings, and
Discourses thereon. Book the First, published in early May, 1847. The
volume contains the two essays mentioned here: “The Art of Living with
Others” and “Education,” but the quoted words here from the proof copy
do not appear in the published version. Probably Helps revised his
essays after receiving JSM’s criticism.

The verso of the MS draft carries the following fragments:

[In pencil] that the worthy & sufficient, & if not sufficient, the only
aim that shall be permitted to one half of the race is to devote their
lives to the exercise of the sexual functions—

This is at the bottom of all the commonplaces about women—& of all that
is said on the subject by persons who fancy themselves not commonplace.

[In ink] as for what women write on the subject of women once they have
expressed the opinion that the intellect of women is inferior to that of
men—this opinion if a true one puts them out of court as evidence on the
subject in opposition to the opinion of men.

Accompanying the draft at LSE is another MS draft to Helps in Harriet
Taylor’s hand:

My dear Sir—

It is as I partly surmised when I answered your former note—Our
disagreement is radical; and I believe I dissent from your standards,
your tests, & your conclusions. This being so shall I be right to take
as permission, or rather as invitation, your first essay, and seeing
(?), that as I of course should not make any annotations or remarks on
your book unless I thought they would improve it, for this very reason I
prefer to make none, because I should always feel it something like a
matter of conscience to hinder the reception of its social doctrines,
and to express by any means open to me my deep rooted opinion of their
mischievous tendency. You will perhaps think this somewhat strong
expression à propos of essays so little dogmatical as yours: but tho
they do not urge, they yet decidedly express with approval opinions &
sentiments which appear to me to lie near and to supply the root of the
monstrous evils and immoralities of our social system. To pass from
generalities to particulars: The people I have lived among and known
intimately have been high minded people—people whose pettinesses of all
kinds—not so much from high breeding in the common acceptation of the
term as from the consequences of much education and developed intellect.
In the society of such people none of the misères you describe (and I
daresay describe truly of ordinary people in the essay called ‘On the
Art of living with others’) do or could exist—such persons would as soon
think of doing any impossible thing as being tracassière annoying
illtempered interfering & unreasonable as you describe every body as
being. They would regard such conduct & the habits of mind from which it
must spring, either as monstrous, or as that of persons too far beneath
them to need or be capable of having with them any other relation than
that of moral instruction. But if the occasion could arise, which high
minded & principled amiability makes all but impossible, these people
would most certainly rather “settle every thing by the force of
sufficient reason” than by “some authorized will” or by “tossing up”! In
my very humble opinion “the force of sufficient reason” is infinitely a
higher motive and power than either “authorized will” or even “tossing
up”. But it is but right to say why are these people what I have
described—because they are treated & treat every body as equals—because
there is no authorized will—no recognition of superiority but that of
mental and moral superiority—above all no recognition of superiority of
sex—to my mind the basest & lowest ground of assumption that can be
conceived, & which I am sure no man ever assumes but from a secret
consciousness of his inability to maintain any other. It follows as a
matter of course that these people are like myself absolute unbelievers.
Indeed I do not believe that lofty character is in these times
consistent with the utter prostration or indolence of intellect
requisite for belief in the low puerilities which now usurp the name of
religion. [Rest in pencil] From all this I think you will perceive that
few things would be less in harmony with your views than any strictures
of mine. I regret much not having found time to consider and return the
proofs sooner.

George Francis Train (1829-1904), American merchant, promoter, author,
and self-styled “Champion Crank.” At this time he was visiting Britain
and working on behalf of imprisoned Fenians. According to his letter of
June 29, Train had been introduced by Col. L. S. Dickson to JSM in the
House of Commons on June 9, and had gained his consent to put a question
in the House to the Home Secretary, “What the Government intended to do
in the case of the two American citizens, Costello and Warren, of the
Jackmel?”

2.
John Warren and Augustine E. Costello were members of a group of Fenians
who had sailed from New York on April 12, 1867, in the Jackmel (renamed
the Erin’s Hope during the voyage) to bring arms and ammunition to the
Fenians in Ireland. On June 1, 1867, when the group landed in Ireland,
twenty-eight of the American Fenians were arrested. Subsequently Warren
and Costello were tried, convicted, and sentenced to long prison terms.
Some of the others, also imprisoned, were released in 1868. Warren and
Costello were finally released early in 1869. For a recent discussion of
the affair, and the repercussions in the United States, see Brian
Jenkins, Fenians and Anglo-American Relations during Reconstruction
(Ithaca, 1969), pp. 236-41.

At the further request of Train (see Letter 1267A), JSM on July 16 in
the Commons addressed a question on Warren and Costello to the Chief
Secretary for Ireland, the Earl of Mayo. See Hansard, CXCIII, col. 1282.

3.
On July 21, J. Vance, MP for Armagh City, in the Commons questioned JSM
whether he had written this sentence to a Mr. Nevin, JSM denied writing
to a Mr. Nevin but admitted having written a letter to a friend of
Warren and Costello “which contained some words bearing some resemblance
to those here quoted.” Denying that he was unwilling that the government
should claim or obtain any credit, he said: “I desire extremely that the
Government should both claim and obtain credit for everything
meritorious that they have done.” See Hansard, CXCIII, cols. 1556-57. On
Vance’s naming of a fictitious Mr. Nevin as JSM’s correspondent, see a
letter by Train in the Revolution, II (Aug. 20, 1868), 103.
