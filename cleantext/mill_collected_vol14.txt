COLLECTED WORKS OF JOHN STUART MILL

volume xiv

Edition: current; Page: [ii]
The Collected Edition of the works of John Stuart Mill has been planned
and is being directed by an editorial committee appointed from the
Faculty of Arts and Science of the University of Toronto, and from the
University of Toronto Press. The primary aim of the edition is to
present fully collated texts of those works which exist in a number of
versions, both printed and manuscript, and to provide accurate texts of
works previously unpublished or which have become relatively
inaccessible.

Preface

since the publication in 1963 of The Earlier Letters of John Stuart
Mill, 1812-1848, ed. Francis E. Mineka (Vols. XII and XIII of the
Collected Works), we have been engaged in the much larger task of
collecting and editing the letters of the last twenty-five years of
Mill’s life. The earlier volumes contained 537 letters, about half of
which had not been previously published; the present volumes contain
over 1800, more than half hitherto unpublished. Most of the collecting
for the earlier volumes was the work of Professor Friedrich A. von
Hayek, begun during World War II; while the present volumes contain many
letters also assembled by him, some of which can no longer be found,
about half have been located within the past ten years by the senior
editor. We have also included in Appendix I over sixty earlier letters
which have come to light since 1963.

The rationale and the method of the present volumes are essentially the
same as those of the earlier volumes. We have included all the personal
letters we have found, but, with one exception (Letter 1292), have
excluded letters expressly written for publication, which will appear in
a later volume of the Collected Works. We have included, however,
private letters printed by their recipients in various papers, usually
without Mill’s permission. We have excluded, because of space, letters
to Mill, but have indicated their location, and on occasion quoted
relevant passages from them in footnotes. A relatively small number of
what may seem to some readers inconsequential or insignificant letters
are included, in the interest of completeness, and in the belief that
details now thought insignificant may, in the light of further research,
come into more meaningful focus.

To identify the “best text” of a letter is much easier than to find it.
The best text is, of course, the original autograph letter. Next best is
a manuscript draft; fortunately for his editors, Mill in later years,
conscious that his letters might be of interest to a wider public,
preserved drafts, often labelled “For Publication.” For many letters the
drafts are the only surviving versions. We have printed these as drafts,
without correcting abbreviations, punctuation, or usage, and without
adding signatures. In both drafts and autograph letters Mill’s spelling
has been retained (e.g. shew for show, stile for style, contemporary for
contemporary, recal for recall); his infrequent errors in French have
not been corrected; and his punctuation has only rarely been altered,
when necessary for clarity of meaning. In a few instances we have had to
assemble a letter from portions now located in different places; for
example, Edition: current; Page: [viii] Letter 653, to W. T. Thornton,
exists in three fragments in the libraries of King’s College, Cambridge,
the University of Leeds, and the London School of Economics. When both
the autograph letter and the draft have been located, we have, of
course, based our transcript on the letter, but on the rare occasions
when there are significant differences between the two we have indicated
those differences in notes. Published versions have been used only when
neither letter nor draft has been located. When no published version is
indicated, the letter is, to the best of our knowledge, published here
for the first time.

The first footnote to each letter provides the following information in
this order: the location of manuscripts when known; addresses of
correspondents and postmarks when available; and the place of
publication of previously published letters.

A special problem arose over the real authorship of certain of the later
letters. From 1865 on, the demands of public life greatly increased the
amount of Mill’s correspondence, to such an extent that he could not
have carried it on without help. That help was provided by his
step-daughter, Helen Taylor. A number of the extant drafts are in her
hand, written from his dictation; some are in his hand, written from her
dictation. Some were composed in whole or part by her and signed by him.
Mill, in notes attached to the drafts, often indicated the extent of
Helen’s contribution. Since the exact contribution of each to letters in
which both had a part cannot be determined, we have adopted the
following practice: we have included letters if they were sent in Mill’s
name and, even when signed by Helen Taylor, if they are in his
handwriting. We have excluded letters that she both wrote and signed.
Notations on the manuscript, whether about publication or Helen’s share
of a letter, are reproduced in the first footnote.

When excerpts of letters have been earlier published, for which no
manuscripts have been located, we have reprinted them as separate
letters, in the hope of leaving as few lacunae in Mill’s correspondence
as possible, and on the chance that the excerpts may lead to the
recovery of the full text. In view of the very widespread dispersal of
Mill’s letters, more will undoubtedly come to light. Some that did
during the course of printing this edition, too late to include in the
regular order, have been placed in Appendix II. Readers who come into
possession of additional letters or of information about their location
will render valuable service to Mill scholarship if they will inform the
Editor of the Collected Works at the University of Toronto Press.

In assembling and editing as large a collection of letters as this, the
editors have inevitably been dependent upon the generous assistance of
many persons. Our basic indebtedness has, of course, been to Professor
F. A. von Hayek, who in the course of his project, undertaken in 1942,
to collect and publish the earlier letters of Mill, also made
transcripts of many later letters, Edition: current; Page: [ix]
including about half of those to be found in this edition. The originals
of some of these can no longer be located (for example, letters to
Thomas Hare, once in the possession of Mrs. K. E. Roberts), and
Professor von Hayek’s transcripts have served as the source of our text
in such instances. He generously turned over to us all his files
relating to Mill’s correspondence. Without his help, the work of
collecting would have been greatly increased. We, and all students of
Mill, must be sincerely grateful to him.

We are indebted for the grant of John Simon Guggenheim Memorial
Foundation and Fulbright research fellowships in 1962-63 to the senior
editor which enabled him to do much of the collecting in England. We
have owed much over the past ten years to a number of assistants whose
employment was made possible by funds from the endowment of the Class of
1916 Professorship at Cornell University held by the senior editor. Mrs.
Emily Morrison in the early stages of the editing got the work off to a
good start. In London in 1962-63 Mr. Peter M. Jackson contributed
greatly in locating out-of-the-way letters and information valuable for
the annotation. Mrs. Eleanor Pike in the earlier stages of the work did
much of the typing. Two graduate students at Cornell, Mrs. Barbara
Hutchison Groninger and Mr. Edwin J. Kenney, contributed a good deal
during their summers. Mrs. Nancy C. Martin located at Colindale some
published letters, and Miss Gillian Workman an unpublished letter at the
Public Records Office. The mainstay of the work since 1963, however, has
been Mrs. Celia Sieverts, whose knowledge of European languages, skill
and persistence in tracking down often very obscure information, and
passion for accuracy have made significant contributions. Without her
help, this edition would have suffered greatly.

Many have aided us in the collecting of the widely scattered letters.
Dr. James M. Osborn of Yale University has with unfailing generosity
made available many letters from his large and ever-growing collection.
Mr. Joseph H. Schaffner of New York freely gave access to his private
collection. M. Pierre Sadi-Carnot arranged for the photographing of
letters in his family papers, as did Mr. W. Rosenberg of the University
of Canterbury, N.Z. The late Professor Delio Cantimori of Florence
secured photographs for us of letters to Pasquale Villari in the library
of the Vatican. Professor Eileen Curran of Colby College, in the course
of her research for The Wellesley Index, turned up a good many letters,
often in out-of-the-way manuscript files. Dr. William E. S. Thomas of
Christ Church, Oxford, located letters to Col. William Napier and
long-sought letters to Sir William Molesworth, which Sir John
Molesworth-St. Aubyn has given permission to publish. Mr. G. A. Wood of
Newcastle, England, sent from his family papers letters to William Wood.
Mr. D. Flanagan of the Co-operative Union Ltd., Manchester, was most
helpful in permitting access to that organization’s collection of George
Jacob Holyoake’s papers. Mr. Dennis O’Brien of Queen’s University,
Edition: current; Page: [x] Belfast, Ireland, kindly supplied
photocopies of letters to Lord Overstone. A number of persons
contributed over the years to the search for the copies of Mill’s
letters smuggled out of Prague at the time of the occupation of
Czechoslovakia by Germany: Professor Eugene Rice, now of Columbia
University, searched archives in Prague, but it was Dr. Linda L.
McAlister, then of Cornell, who provided the clue that led us to
Professor Roderick M. Chisholm of Brown University, who was able to
supply photographs from the Brentano collection. Professor Jack
Stillinger of the University of Illinois, Professor Michael Wolff, then
of Indiana University, now of the University of Massachusetts, Professor
J. A. La Nauze and Mr. N. B. de Marchi of the Australian National
University, Professor F. B. Smith of the University of Melbourne, Mr.
Richard Ormond of the National Portrait Gallery in London, Mr. J. H.
Prynne of the Library of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, all
helped us in gaining access to letters in the possession of their
respective institutions. Mrs. Evelyn Pugh of George Washington
University and Mr. Russell Buchan of Vanderbilt University located for
us letters published in American newspapers. Among those who supplied us
with letters in their possession were Professor Joseph Hamburger of Yale
University, Principal John M. Robson of the University of Toronto, the
late Dr. Adelaide Weinberg of London, Professor Edward Alexander of the
University of Washington, Professor Ronald H. Coase of the University of
Virginia, the late Professor Jacob Viner of Princeton University,
Professor Joseph Dorfman of Columbia University, Professor Leslie
Marchand of Rutgers University, Professor Edward Shils of the University
of Chicago, Mrs. Caroline Hughes D’Agostino and Mrs. George Hughes,
Professor Iring Fetscher, Mr. Richard A. Ehrlich, Mr. E. Liggett, Mr.
Michael Maurice, and Mr. L. S. Johnson. Professor Cecil Lang of the
University of Virginia, Professor Walter E. Houghton of Wellesley
College, and Dr. Stephen Frick of Cornell called our attention to
letters in various libraries in England. The late Professor Daniel
Villey of Paris provided us with information that led to the recovery of
a number of letters to Charles Dupont-White. In other searches in Paris
we were assisted by Professors Anne Humphreys, John Mineka, and Baxter
Hathaway. Professor von Hayek graciously permitted us to reproduce the
portrait of Harriet Mill in his possession, as did Dr. Graham Hutton his
hitherto unreproduced portrait of Mill.

Others who aided in various ways, particularly in the annotation,
included Professors Gordon Kirkwood, Harry Caplan, James Hutton, Douglas
Dowd, Robert Kaske, Edward Morris, all of Cornell University; Professor
Paul Parker of Hamilton College; Harold E. Dailey of Columbia
University; M. J.-P. Mayer, editor of the works of De Tocqueville;
Professor Henry W. Spiegel of the Catholic University of America;
Professor Edward C. Mack of the City University of New York; Professor
Ann Robson of the University Edition: current; Page: [xi] of Toronto. Of
the many librarians to whose assistance we are indebted we can mention
here only Professors Felix Reichmann, the late George H. Healey, and
Donald Eddy of the Cornell University Library, Miss Judith A. Schiff of
the Yale University Library, and Mr. C. G. Allen of the British Library
of Political and Economic Science at the London School of Economics, who
have over the years been unfailingly generous. To Muriel Mineka and
Janie Lindley we owe our deepest gratitude for assistance in countless
ways, but most of all for their sympathetic interest which has sustained
us throughout the long task. If we have overlooked some in this long
catalogue of our debts, we extend our apologies. We cannot conclude,
however, without acknowledging the wise supervision and counsel of the
present editor of the Collected Works; from Principal John M. Robson’s
comprehensive and detailed knowledge of Mill we have profited at almost
every turn.

Introduction

It seems to me that there is a very great significance in
letter-writing, and that it differs from daily intercourse as the
dramatic differs from the epic or the narrative. It is the life of man,
and above all the chief part of his life, his inner life, not gradually
unfolded without break or sudden transition, those changes which take
place insensibly being also manifested insensibly; but exhibited in a
series of detached scenes, taken at considerable intervals from one
another, shewing the completed change of position or feeling, without
the process by which it was effected; affording a glimpse or partial
view of the mighty river of life at some few points, and leaving the
imagination to trace to itself such figure or scheme as it can of the
course of the stream in that far larger portion of space where it winds
its way through thickets or impenetrable forests and is invisible: this
alone being known to us, that whatever may have been its course through
the wilderness, it has had some course, & that a continuous one, & which
might by human opportunity have been watched and discovered, though to
us, too probably, destined to be for ever unknown. . . .

Mill to John Sterling, May 24, 1832

the present four volumes and the two volumes of Earlier Letters,
published in 1963, constitute a collected edition of all the letters of
John Stuart Mill available at this time. The separate publication of
earlier and later letters, instead of the more usual multi-volume single
publication of a whole collection all in one sequence and provided with
one index, was dictated more by circumstances than by any inherent
distinction between Mill’s earlier and later letters. The whole
correspondence is the life of the man, “and above all the chief part of
his life, his inner life.”

When, thirty years ago, Professor Friedrich von Hayek first turned his
attention to Mill’s correspondence, however, a major reason for
collecting and separately publishing his earlier letters was the
inadequate representation of them in the only collected edition of
Mill’s correspondence—the two volumes edited and published by Hugh S. R.
Elliot in 1910. That collection of 368 letters contained only 52 for the
years ending with 1848, somewhat less than one in ten of those it proved
possible to assemble. It seemed reasonable to infer that Mill’s later
correspondence was much more adequately represented in the Elliot
edition, but that inference has proved not wholly sound. It is true that
Elliot includes a larger proportion of the extant later letters than of
the earlier: about one in six of the more than 1800 post-1848 letters,
as against one in ten of the earlier letters. That larger proportion
turns out, however, to be misleading. Elliot’s collection is no more
fully Edition: current; Page: [xvi] representative of the substance of
the later correspondence than it is of the earlier.

That this is so is not to be charged to Elliot’s defects as an editor,
but rather to be the circumstances under which he worked. Professor von
Hayek in his Introduction to Earlier Letters has recounted in some
detail the history of Mill’s papers after 1873, and the story need not
be repeated here. Suffice it to recall that Mill had evidently intended
that a selection of his letters should eventually be published; at least
as early as 1849 he preserved drafts of some of them and at some point,
presumably late in his life, carefully labelled a good many, “For
publication.” His intention was long frustrated, not purposely it is
clear, by his stepdaughter, Helen Taylor, who inherited his property,
his copyrights, and his papers. She admired her stepfather deeply and
sought to honour his name and extend his reputation; she promptly
prepared for publication and edited his posthumously published books,
the Autobiography (1873), Three Essays on Religion (1874), the fourth
volume of Dissertations and Discussions (1875), and “Chapters on
Socialism” (1879), and planned to edit his letters. Professor von Hayek
(Earlier Letters, p. xviii) cites a passage written by Helen about three
months after Mill’s death:

I have all my dear stepfather’s letters, preserved, looked through from
time to time by himself, arranged in order by myself, and left by him in
my hands with directions, verbal and written, to deal with them
according to my judgement. When the more pressing task of the
publication of his MSS. is completed, I shall, if I live, occupy myself
with his correspondence, if I do not live it will be for my literary
Executors to decide what to do with it.

The statement, as will presently be seen, contains at least one
exaggeration: she did not have in her possession all Mill’s letters.
Those she did have she guarded jealously for over thirty years; she
never got around to publishing them herself, and repeatedly refused to
permit others to publish even excerpts from them. At her death in 1907,
her niece, Mary Taylor, younger daughter of Helen’s brother Algernon,
inherited her property, including the Mill letters in her possession.
Soon thereafter, Mary Taylor decided to execute the long-deferred
project to publish them. She arranged for a little known writer, Hugh
Elliot, to prepare the edition from the collection so long in the
possession of Helen Taylor. He was not permitted to publish family
papers, the most important of which were many letters to Harriet Mill
and Helen Taylor; Mary Taylor proposed to publish separately a selection
of these herself. Elliot apparently was under no obligation, and
apparently felt none, to look farther afield for letters not in the
collection turned over to him; after all, it contained some hundreds of
letters, both to and by Mill. By the rather loose standards still
prevailing in 1910 for the editing of letters, Elliot prepared an
adequate edition that was widely and favourably reviewed.

Edition: current; Page: [xvii]
Only in recent years has it become evident how meagrely the edition
represented the range and variety of Mill’s correspondence. In selecting
his letters for possible publication Mill had sought to advance the
spread of his opinions on a number of subjects rather than to preserve
details of his personal life in his later years; the selected letters
were not to serve as an autobiography but as a kind of anthology of
those of his opinions that he felt might be helpful to an audience wider
than that to which they had been originally addressed. A kindred
motivation is noticeable in the last chapter of his Autobiography, which
opens with this statement: “From this time [about 1840], what is worth
relating of my life will come into very small compass; for I have no
further mental changes to tell of, but only, as I hope, a continued
mental progress; which does not admit of a consecutive history, and the
results of which, if real, will best be found in my writings. I shall,
therefore, greatly abridge the chronicle of my subsequent years.” As a
result the final chapter, most readers seem to agree, is the least
interesting part of the Autobiography, in that it is least
self-revealing. The period of Mill’s life covered by it is also the one
that stands most in need of the supplementary detail, the glimpses into
his personal life, his marriage, his friendships, his enthusiasms, and
his disappointments, which now, nearly one hundred years after his
death, only his letters can supply.

That kind of supplementary detail, Elliot, limited as he was by Mary
Taylor’s restrictions and by Mill’s selection of his own correspondence,
could hardly have been expected to provide. It is even a question,
working when he did, whether he could have located many of the letters
of which Mill had not kept copies. Elliot had access to seven of Mill’s
earlier correspondences, those with John Sterling, Thomas Carlyle, W. J.
Fox, John Robertson, Gustave d’Eichthal, Robert Barclay Fox, and Auguste
Comte (the latter four had each been separately published before 1910),
but he presented only a small number of the letters to Sterling and
Carlyle, accepting almost wholly the limits of Mill’s selection. In all
likelihood, Elliot probably did not even see the long sequences of
letters Mill wrote to his closest friends during his later years. The
past twenty-five or thirty years have brought to light a number of
extensive series of Mill’s letters that had been preserved by their
recipients but either had not been written in draft or had not been kept
in that form by Mill.

As a consequence, Elliot’s edition gives neither a balanced conspectus
of Mill’s correspondence as a whole nor a lifelike portrait of the man.
What the edition does give is a good sampling of what might be called
his “public” or “non-personal” correspondence. Increasingly, after the
success of his Logic (1843) and his Political Economy (1848), Mill
received many letters, often from complete strangers, asking his
opinion, or even advice, on a wide range of questions raised by his
writings—among others, questions on religion, Edition: current; Page:
[xviii] philosophy, ethics, logic, economics, political reform, labour
relations, and women’s rights. The letter writers included students,
clergymen, working men as well as titled lords, aspiring writers,
amateur political economists, wouldbe philosophers, and practising
politicians. They were not all British; letters came with increasing
frequency from Frenchmen, Italians, Germans, and Americans. As early as
1850 he wrote Frederick J. Furnivall, “My whole time would hardly
suffice to give satisfactory answers to all the questions I am asked by
correspondents previously unknown to me” (p. 53). Nevertheless, Mill,
always seeking to promote the improvement of mankind by doing what he
could to advance sound thinking and opinion, felt an obligation to such
earnest readers and correspondents and conscientiously tried to write
them helpful answers. Of such letters he frequently kept MS drafts, but
of letters to his friends and regular correspondents he seldom kept
copies. As a consequence, Elliot’s edition, dependent almost wholly on
Mill’s selection, has a higher proportion of such impersonal letters
than is characteristic of the larger body of his correspondence. The
present edition with its much larger number of personal letters should
enable students of Mill to gain a clearer picture and a greater
understanding of the man.

The following comparisons are not presented in a spirit of denigration;
the Elliot edition has served a useful purpose for over sixty years, but
in view of the increased interest in and knowledge of Mill it is no
longer sufficient. The search begun by Professor von Hayek during World
War II for a more adequate collection has been carried on by others and
while it is likely, indeed certain, that more letters will come to light
in the years that lie ahead, the present editors hope that this edition
will meet the needs of students of Mill for some years to come.

To resort to a numerical comparison has its limitations but it can also
be revealing. Of 124 letters located to Mill’s lifelong friend and
fellow reformer, Edwin Chadwick, for instance, Elliot prints nine in
whole or part. Of 92 extant letters to John Elliot Cairnes, Mill’s
friend and disciple, Elliot has five. Of 60 to John Chapman, the
publisher for many years of the Westminster Review, Elliot has two, and
a like number to William E. Hickson, Mill’s successor as Editor of the
London and Westminster, while we have been able to include 32. Elliot
has five letters to Henry Fawcett, the blind politician and political
economist—this edition, 43; Elliot, three to Thomas Hare, the advocate
of proportional representation—this edition, 41; Elliot, five to George
Grote, the historian of Greece and friend of Mill since his boyhood, and
five to Sir Charles Dilke—this edition, 22 and 26, respectively. Elliot
has one letter to Louis Blanc, out of 25 now available, and one to
Gustave d’Eichthal (in a renewal of an earlier correspondence) as
compared with 54. Elliot includes two letters to George Croom Robertson,
this edition 29. Elliot has no letters to John Plummer, a working-class
journalist; to George Edition: current; Page: [xix] J. Holyoake, the
radical secularist and proponent of co-operatives; to Augustus De
Morgan, the mathematician; to Herbert Spencer, the philosopher; or to
William Dougal Christie, an active opponent of electoral corruption, who
after Mill’s death rose to the defence of his reputation against the
slanderous attacks of Abraham Hayward; the letters to these men now
published total 162. We have been unable to improve much on Elliot’s
fifteen letters to Alexander Bain, the Scottish logician and
psychologist, for we have failed to locate the autograph letters to him.
We have, however, succeeded in locating more originals of the letters to
the Italian historian Pasquale Villari than were available to Elliot in
drafts, but there are undoubtedly more yet to be found. We have been
able to add only two to Elliot’s ten to T. E. Cliffe Leslie, the
political economist, and only six to Elliot’s nine to William Thomas
Thornton, Mill’s friend and long-time colleague at the East India House.

These additional letters have been assembled from widely separated
collections: the letters to Chadwick, De Morgan, and Robertson in the
library of University College, London; to Cairnes and Fawcett at the
London School of Economics, as the result of the efforts of Professor
von Hayek when he was on the faculty there; to John Chapman, chiefly in
the libraries of the National University of Australia at Canberra, of
Indiana University, and the London School of Economics; to Hickson, at
the Huntington Library in California; to Louis Blanc, at the
Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris; both earlier and later letters to
Gustave d’Eichthal at the Bibliothèque de l’Arsenal, also in Paris; and
to Charles Dupont-White, in the possession of M. Pierre Sadi-Carnot of
Paris; to Hare, a private collection in the possession in 1943 of Mrs.
K. E. Roberts of London, and in the British Museum; to Grote and Dilke
in the British Museum; to Plummer at the University of Melbourne,
Australia; to Holyoake at the Manchester Co-operative Union, Ltd.; to
Spencer, at Northwestern University; to Christie, at Cornell University;
and to Villari, in the library of the Vatican in Rome. Both earlier and
later letters to Henry S. Chapman are in the possession of W. Rosenberg
of the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, and all the letters to
Thomas Carlyle are in the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh. Of
the series of letters to American correspondents, those to Charles Eliot
Norton are at Harvard, those to Rowland G. Hazard at the Rhode Island
Historical Society. Except for a small number at the London School of
Economics, the many letters to Harriet are at Yale University. It should
be noted that all these series, except the one to Spencer, are of the
original autograph letters, not of MS drafts preserved by Mill.

Professor von Hayek, in his account of the first sale of 21 lots of
Mill’s papers at Sotheby’s on March 29, 1922, notes that most of the
miscellaneous letters now in various American libraries, notably those
at the Johns Hopkins Edition: current; Page: [xx] University (248
letters, mostly drafts), derive from that sale. A large part of the
major collection at the London School of Economics derives from the same
sale, as do the 61 letters at the Brotherton Library of the University
of Leeds, and the 18 letters to John Sterling in the library of King’s
College, Cambridge. The 368 letters in the Elliot edition seem to have
been drawn almost wholly from the collection eventually disposed of at
this first sale in 1922. Elliot was denied the use of the 132 manuscript
letters to Harriet included among the 14 lots disposed of at the second
sale at Sotheby’s on July 27, 1927; these letters form the largest part
of the 230 letters now at Yale University, which also possesses a good
many from the first sale. Family letters not included in either sale
were eventually given to the London School of Economics by the National
Provincial Bank, Ltd., the residuary legatees and literary executors of
Mary Taylor.

Many important letters have been found in published versions for which
no manuscripts have apparently survived. The most important of these are
31 letters in full or in part to Theodor Gomperz, a young German scholar
who translated a number of Mill’s works and edited the first collected
edition of his writings. These letters were first published by Heinrich
Gomperz in his biography of his father (Vienna, 1936) and then in part
by Lord Stamp, who had purchased the MSS, in The Times on December 29,
1938. The manuscripts were destroyed by the bombing raid of April 16,
1941, in which Lord Stamp was killed. Other letters, usually in
excerpted form, the MSS of which disappeared in less spectacular
fashion, have been found in Bain’s biography of Mill and in various
biographies of Mill’s friends. Many have also been located in English
and American newspapers, most of them published by the recipients
without Mill’s permission. His reputation and his influence in the later
years of his life were so great that letters from him were rightly
judged newsworthy. Mill was often annoyed by such unauthorized
publication. As he explained to Duncan McLaren in a letter of January 3,
1869,

As a rule . . . I prefer that my letters should not be made public
unless they were written with a view to the contingency of their being
so, & I have seen with regret several recent instances in which
publicity has been given to them without my consent; not that I shrink
from exposure to criticism, which any public man, even any writer, ought
to welcome, from however hostile a quarter; but because, when writing
confidentially to friends who feel as one does oneself, one takes many
things for granted which would require explanation to general readers, &
one does not guard one’s expressions as prudence & courtesy would
require one to do in addressing oneself to those who differ with one.

We cannot approve of the discourtesy of correspondents who published
personal letters, but, since the manuscripts of most of these have
disappeared, students of Mill may feel some inclination to condone the
discourtesy. On at least one occasion Mill granted permission to publish
his letter, but requested Edition: current; Page: [xxi] the recipient to
modify some of the wording (Letter 1258). Most of such letters, of
course, were on topics of public interest at the time, and most of the
correspondents who made them available for publication agreed with
Mill’s opinions as expressed in the letters and wished to gain for their
own causes his prestigious support.

Such letters are largely impersonal in tone and provide few insights
into the nature of the man who wrote them. For more such insights we are
now fortunate in having available, in addition to the Autobiography, a
series of letters to friends in both the earlier and the later periods
of his life. Of the earlier letters, most revealing and most interesting
are the series to John Sterling, Thomas Carlyle, William Johnson Fox,
Robert Barclay Fox, and Gustave d’Eichthal, largely concentrated in the
1830’s and early 1840’s when Mill after his mental crisis was still in
reaction against the emotionally sterile education and philosophic creed
of his adolescence and was still reshaping his personal life. Most of
the later series lack something of the inherent interest of letters
written during a period of crucial intellectual and emotional change.
The friendships of one’s youth are likely to be the warmest of one’s
life and the least subject to reserve. The earlier years of most
autobiographies have an appeal for many readers greater than that of the
later years. Nevertheless the series of Mill’s maturity have an
attraction of their own, different in quality and intensity perhaps, but
nonetheless interesting because of the revelations of the variety of his
friendships, the breadth of his interests, the strength of his
individuality, and the modernity of his approach to those problems of
his age that continue into ours.

Did any Victorian have a wider range of more or less regular
correspondents both at home and abroad? At home there were fellow
economists like Cairnes and Leslie, the classical scholar George Grote,
the philosopher Herbert Spencer, the logician and psychologist Alexander
Bain, the writers John Sterling and Thomas Carlyle, the mathematician
Augustus De Morgan, political and administrative reformers like
Chadwick, Charles Wentworth Dilke, and W. D. Christie, the editors John
Chapman and John Morley, W. G. Ward the Roman Catholic convert and
apologist, the Unitarian W. J. Fox, and the atheist G. J. Holyoake.
Mill’s foreign correspondence marks him as perhaps, in his generation of
Englishmen, the most nearly a citizen of the world; it seems almost as
though he had chosen correspondents in the United States, the antipodes,
and the major European nations so that he might be kept informed of
developments in their parts of the world. The writers included: in
France, Gustave d’Eichthal, an early St. Simonian, later a classicist,
ethnologist, and Biblical scholar, and Charles Dupont-White, political
economist and translator of several of Mill’s books; from France, though
for most of the years of his friendship an exile in England, the
historian, journalist, and radical politician, Louis Blanc; in Vienna,
the young classical Edition: current; Page: [xxii] scholar and
historian, Gomperz; in Germany, late in Mill’s life, Franz Brentano, the
philosopher; in Italy, Pasquale Villari, the historian; in New Zealand,
his early friend Henry Chapman, who had emigrated and become an
important officer of government; in America, John Lothrop Motley,
historian and diplomatist, as well as Charles Eliot Norton, editor and
biographer, later a Harvard professor, and Rowland G. Hazard, business
man and philosopher. One notices that while Mill’s regular
correspondents shared his interests and in the main agreed with his
views—most of them might have been labelled liberals or even radicals—by
no means all of them came from levels of society that proper
mid-Victorians would have labelled “polite”. G. J. Holyoake,
ex-Chartist, radical freethinker, and publicist, when various of the
journals he published fell into financial difficulties, was rescued by
Mill. Louis Blanc, who according to Mill was “associated in the vulgar
English mind with everything that can be made a bugbear of” (p. 999),
was a frequent dinner guest at Blackheath, both before and after the
death of Harriet. William Wood was a worker in the potteries of north
England; and John Plummer was a factory worker turned journalist, who
with his wife was invited from time to time by Mill to dinner at his
home in Blackheath Park. (John Morley once remarked that working men
found easier access to Mill than did royalty.) For Mill the crucial test
in the choice of both friends and correspondents was whether they could
contribute to the advancement of the ideas and causes in which he
believed; he was always eager to learn from them and welcomed their
opinions even when they differed from him in details.

Some of the correspondences, notably those with Bain, Cairnes, and
Spencer, were essentially philosophic discourses conducted by mail,
sifting difficult questions in logic, philosophy, science, and political
economy, often with a view to the ever-continuing revision and
improvement of such major works as the Logic (8 editions) and the
Political Economy (7 editions). On one occasion, in thanking Cairnes for
his extensive notes for the revision of the Political Economy, Mill
remarked the similarity to “the philosophic correspondences in which the
thinkers of the 16th and 17th centuries used to compare notes and
discuss each other’s opinions before or after publication—of which we
have so many interesting specimens in the published works of Descartes”
(p. 975). Such letters as that to Bain on the conservation of force
(Letter 1554) probably have less interest for the modern reader than the
letters that discuss practical questions of political and social reform
and the strategies for the attainment of such reforms; still, they do
contribute to our understanding of the close reasoning and the constant
striving for perfection that always characterized Mill’s philosophic
work.

In the letters dealing with reform, there is always a sense of rejoicing
in the fellowship of allies, a feeling “of brotherhood in arms with
those who Edition: current; Page: [xxiii] are . . . fighting . . . the
battles of advanced liberalism” (p. 1511).1 Mill’s need for fellowship
was a long-standing one. As early as 1829 in his first extant letter to
John Sterling, describing his sense of loneliness in the years following
his mental crisis, Mill wrote: “By loneliness I mean the absence of that
feeling which has accompanied me through the greater part of my life,
that which one fellow traveller, or one fellow soldier has towards
another—the feeling of being engaged in the pursuit of a common object,
and of mutually cheering one another on, and helping one another in an
arduous undertaking” (Earlier Letters, p. 30).

Mill’s life-long need for emotional support is probably the explanation
of the riddle of his relationship with Mrs. John Taylor, who after
twenty years of close friendship became his wife. Now, with the full
publication of all his known extant letters to her, by far the most
voluminous of his correspondences, some further clues to the riddle may
be discerned.2 When his Autobiography was published within six months
after his death, Mill’s extravagant tributes to his wife’s intellectual
abilities and to her contributions to his thought and writing were
greeted generally with amused scepticism.3 The reviewer in the British
Quarterly Review remarked dryly: “Mill had no great faith in a God. He
had unbounded confidence in a goddess.” Alexander Bain, reading the
proofs of the Autobiography and fearful that Mill’s reputation would
suffer seriously if his most extreme claims for his wife were not
deleted, wrote to Helen Taylor, Mill’s literary executor, to urge that
she should cancel “those sentences where he declares her to be a greater
poet than Carlyle, and a greater thinker than himself—and again, a
greater leader than his father (or at all events an equal).” Bain
continued:

I venture to express the opinion that no such combination has ever been
realised in the history of the human race, and I am sure that many will
take the same view; and the whole of his statements will be treated as
pure hyperbole, proving, indeed, the strength of his feelings, but not
the reality of the case. I think that your mother, yourself, and Mr.
Mill will all be placed in a false position before the world by such
extreme statements.

(Sept. 6, 1873, MS at LSE)

Helen, whether out of loyalty to her mother or unwillingness to distort
by omission Mill’s expression of his obsessive admiration of Harriet,
refused to make the suggested deletions, though she did, with
reluctance, remove praise of herself. Bain’s fears proved to be
exaggerated, and over the years most readers of the Autobiography have
been inclined to view charitably the Edition: current; Page: [xxiv]
extravagant praise of Harriet as the harmless aberration of a
love-blinded widower.

A somewhat different perspective on the question, however, is now
necessary. Ever since the publication of Professor Jack Stillinger’s
edition of The Early Draft of John Stuart Mill’s Autobiography (Urbana,
Ill., 1961) it has been clear that most of the praise of Harriet in the
Autobiography had been written, not after her death, but during their
married life, and indeed had been submitted to her for her approval,
which apparently was given without protest. From the letters in the
present volumes it is further evident that the defence and justification
of Mill’s and Harriet’s unconventional friendship and eventual marriage
constituted one of the main original purposes of writing the
Autobiography. For Harriet, who participated actively in planning the
book, it was probably the major purpose. Mill wrote to her on January
23, 1854, of the desirability of completing it as soon as possible:

What there is of it is in a perfectly publishable state . . . & it
contains a full writing out as far as any thing can write out, what you
are, as far as I am competent to describe you & what I owe to you—but,
besides that until revised by you it is little better than unwritten, it
contains nothing about our private circumstances, further than shewing
that there was intimate friendship for many years, & you only can decide
what more it is necessary or desirable to say in order to stop the
mouths of enemies hereafter

(pp. 137-38).

To his request of February 13 that she give him “a general notion of
what we should say or imply respecting our private concerns” (p. 159),
Harriet’s reply of February 14-15 (one of the very few of her letters to
him still extant) was quite explicit:

Should there not be a summary of our relationship from its commencement
in 1830—I mean given in a dozen lines—so as to preclude other and
different versions of our lives at Ki[ngston] and Wal[ton]—our summer
excursions, etc. This ought to be done in its genuine simplicity &
truth—strong affection, intimacy of friendship, and no impropriety. It
seems to me an edifying picture for those poor wretches who cannot
conceive friendship but in sex—nor believe that expediency and the
consideration for feelings of others can conquer sensuality. But of
course this is not my reason for wishing it done. It is that every
ground should be occupied by ourselves on our own subject

(p. 166 n.).

The early draft was written in 1853-54, at a time when the two were
still smarting from the gossip that had pursued them for at least twenty
years; it was also written at a time when Mill feared that his death was
imminent. Evidently, his original intention was to divide the work into
two parts, the pre- and the post-Harriet periods of his life. Such a
division proved to be impracticable, partly because of the
disproportionate lengths of the two periods, and a compromise revision
was achieved which blurred the sharp distinction between the two
sections. Nevertheless, if Mill had died in, say Edition: current; Page:
[xxv] 1856, the work if published would have given the concluding
emphasis to the justification and glorification of his wife. In that
form it seems reasonable to doubt that it could have added as much to
Mill’s reputation as did the final version achieved by the revision and
extension completed about 1870.

One can understand that in the months following Harriet’s death on
November 3, 1858, Mill in grief for his devastating loss should have
eulogized her in his letters. The most extravagant evaluation occurs in
a hitherto unpublished letter to Louis Blanc:

I do not speak from feeling but from long standing and sober conviction
in saying that when she died this country lost the greatest mind it
contained. You cannot know what she was privately, but you, more than
most men, can sympathize in the nobleness of her public objects, which
never stopped short of perfect distributive justice as the final aim,
implying therefore a state of society entirely communist in practice and
spirit, whether also in institutions or not. The entire faith in the
ultimate possibilities of human nature was drawn from her own glorious
character, while her keen perception of present difficulties and
obstacles was derived from her wonderful practical discernment, and
comprehension of life

(p. 601).

Although the years after 1858 did not mitigate his extravagant estimate
of Harriet, they did lead him to soften or omit a number of the
asperities which had been clearly inspired by his relationship with her
and which she had not sought to modify when she read the draft. It was
not by her advice that he eliminated the severe criticism of his mother
found in the early draft, or his belittling of his one-time friend John
Roebuck, or his attack upon Sarah Austin, whom in earlier years he had
addressed as “Dear Mutterlein” (see Earlier Letters).

Harriet’s grudge against the society that had excluded her from polite
circles is understandable. As the pretty, striking young wife of a
prosperous, not unintelligent though perhaps rather unimaginative,
business man, John Taylor, her circle had been limited but not without
interest. Although Unitarians may still have been “a sect every where
spoken against,” they were intellectually, and to some extent socially,
the aristocrats among the Dissenters. The Taylors entertained generously
among those whom Carlyle scornfully labelled “friends of the species,”
reformers, Benthamites, yet substantial citizens withal. But there was a
flaw in the outwardly happy marriage. Mr. Taylor shared too little
Harriet’s aesthetic and intellectual interests. Legend has it that she
turned for advice to her pastor, the liberal Unitarian preacher and
writer, the Reverend William Johnson Fox, and that he was responsible
for calling to her attention the twenty-four-year-old John Stuart Mill,
then unknown to the general public as a writer but regarded in liberal
circles as a highly promising if somewhat manufactured genius. Mill and
Mrs. Taylor first met in 1830 in the Taylor home at a dinner party also
attended by Harriet Martineau and John Roebuck.

Edition: current; Page: [xxvi]
Just how rapidly the acquaintance ripened into love is not clear, but by
the summer of 1832 Mill and Mrs. Taylor were exchanging agonized love
letters, and by September, 1833, a crisis was reached in the Taylors’
marriage. She went off to Paris for a trial separation from her husband,
and Mill soon followed. Members of her family intervened to patch up the
threatened marriage and obviate scandal. Mrs. Taylor returned to her
husband’s home and to a marriage henceforth only nominal. She had not,
however, “renounced sight” of Mill, and their meetings were frequent,
both at her home and elsewhere. From time to time they spent vacations
together on the Continent, sometimes with her children and one or
another of his younger brothers. Gossip thrived, of course, though the
evidence seems fairly clear that there was no sexual relationship. Mrs.
Taylor succeeded in holding both her husband and her lover at arm’s
length. Some years after her marriage to Mill she told the young Gomperz
that she was his Seelenfreundin.

Inevitably, Mill’s attachment to Mrs. Taylor restricted his contacts in
English society, and for a time he worried that it would destroy his
usefulness as a reformer. Some of his friends he cut because they had
advised him against continuing the relationship or had participated in
the gossip; others he cut because she disliked them. She herself seems
to have had little capacity for friendship, especially with members of
her own sex. Her only close woman friend was the somewhat elfin Eliza
Flower, who herself came under a cloud because of her relationship with
the Reverend W. J. Fox. Mill’s circle narrowed over the long years
before the death of John Taylor in 1849 finally made possible the
marriage with Harriet in 1851; thereafter the circle became even more
circumscribed. He soon cut himself off from his sisters and preserved
only a formal relationship with his mother, all because of fancied
slights to his wife. An admittedly gauche letter by his brother George
about the marriage provoked a savage, withering reply (pp. 73-75).
Probably the greatest blot on Mill’s character was his treatment,
apparently with Harriet’s encouragement, of his family after his
marriage, as seen in other letters included in this edition. Even after
his mother’s death when he proposed to Harriet that he should give up
his share of his mother’s estate to his sisters, Harriet insisted that
he should not yield to his generous impulse (see pp. 220 and 223). Only
some years after her death did he begin to treat his sisters more kindly
and even to provide financial assistance for at least one of them, Mary
Colman.

As for society, Henry Reeve, acquainted with Mill since their boyhood,
writer of the Edinburgh’s hostile review of the Autobiography in 1874,
spoke for Mrs. Grundy: “From the moment he devoted himself exclusively
to what he calls ‘the most valuable friendship of my life,’ [his ties
with talented women like Mrs. Buller, Mrs. Austin, and Mrs. Grote were
broken.] Whatever may have been their regard for Mill, these ladies
found it impossible to countenance Edition: current; Page: [xxvii] or
receive a woman who had placed herself in so equivocal a position.” (ER,
CXXXIX (Jan., 1874), 122.) Enough is known of Mrs. Austin and Mrs.
Grote, as well as of Mrs. Carlyle, and of their tolerance for
unconventionality, to make one suspect that it was not their concern for
Mrs. Grundy, but their not wholly unjustified dislike for Harriet that
led them to ostracize her. She, deeply resenting her exclusion, of
course attributed it to her breaking of convention in her long
association with Mill during her first husband’s lifetime. And under her
sway Mill made the justification of that association one of his major
purposes in writing his autobiography.

Was he then simply deluded? Was he who was ordinarily so discerning in
his analysis of men and motives blinded when it came to appraising her?
There can be no question that from the first she filled an enormous need
in his emotional life. Suffering from a too exclusively intellectual
education that had starved the affections and led to his near nervous
breakdown at twenty, he sought a friend with whom he could share his
inmost thoughts and feelings and upon whom he could rely for comradeship
in the causes he held most dear. For a time, as his letters reveal, it
seemed that John Sterling might fulfil the role, and for a while, even
after Mill had met Harriet, Carlyle appeared to be a possibility. But,
for good or ill, the friend he found was Mrs. Taylor: for good, in that
she provided a centre of stability for his emotional and, to some
extent, his intellectual life; for ill, in that she fostered the
isolation from his contemporaries that had characterized his earlier
life. Loverlike, in his early relation with her, he engaged in lover’s
flattery of her, not of her beauty but of her intellectual abilities and
interests, on which she prided herself. She was intelligent, she shared
his passion for social reform, and she was at times even more direct and
unwavering than he in going to the heart of a social or political
problem. She also had a much better sense than he did of management of
everyday, practical affairs, and after their marriage he became
dependent upon her judgment in such matters. She in turn seems to have
become more and more dependent upon him in her need of praise. One can
understand a woman’s acceptance of even extravagant flattery in a
lover’s or even a husband’s letters; one finds it more difficult to
comprehend a wife’s coolly approving for publication such extraordinary
tributes as Mill paid Harriet in the Autobiography.

Although she seems not to have objected to overpraise of herself, on at
least one occasion she objected to his too laudatory words in a review
article. Mill acknowledged the fault: “I am always apt to get
enthusiastic about those who do great things for progress & are
immensely ahead of everybody else in their age . . . & I am not always
sufficiently careful to explain that the praise is relative to the then
state & not the now state of knowledge & of what ought to be improved
feeling” (pp. 17-18). In this case his perhaps extravagant praise was
for the ancient Athenians, but his reply gives a clue to his feelings
Edition: current; Page: [xxviii] about Harriet; in his view she was
always for doing “great things for progress” and was “immensely ahead of
everybody else in [her] age,” in “what ought to be improved feeling.”

In his marriage the sense of communion, of sharing in the advancement of
common causes, gave Mill relief from his otherwise ever-present feeling
of aloneness. Sympathizing with Frederick Denison Maurice’s expression
of “mental loneliness” in 1865, he wrote:

In our age & country, every person with any mental power at all, who
both thinks for himself & has a conscience, must feel himself, to a very
great degree, alone. I shd think you have decidedly more people who are
in real communion of thoughts, feelings & purposes with you than I have.
I am in this supremely happy, that I have had, & even now have [with
Helen Taylor], that communion in the fullest degree where it is most
valuable, in my own home. But I have it nowhere else; & if people did
but know how much more precious to me is the faintest approach to it,
than all the noisy eulogiums in the world!

(p. 1048.)

To the need for that continued communion through some long separations
we owe the large number of Mill’s letters to Harriet. Several years
after their marriage both were afflicted with critical ill health.
First, in the fall of 1853, on the advice of their physicians, Mill and
Harriet, accompanied by Helen, sought to restore their health by a
three-month residence in the more favourable climate of Nice. There
Harriet suffered a severe haemorrhage and nearly died. Mill’s own
condition improved little if any, but after moving Harriet to Hyères,
where she remained until spring, he returned to his work at the India
House early in January. His 38 letters to her between December 28, 1853,
and April 11, 1854, when she returned home, give the best picture
available of their life at Blackheath Park, for in the two other series
of his letters to her, he was travelling while she remained in England.
Almost none of her letters to him during these separations survived, for
he seems dutifully to have followed her instructions to destroy them (p.
146).

His letters to her are, of course, informal and miscellaneous, dealing
more or less at random with matters of both private and public interest.
The underlying concern in them all is the state of their health; he
awaits eagerly her reports and gives her details of his visits to his
physicians, describes sometimes almost clinically his symptoms, and
specifies the medicines he is taking. Linked with the matter of their
health are the questions of when to retire from the East India Company
and where they should live thereafter. The prospect of reduced income in
retirement was perhaps responsible for Mill’s concern about household
expenses during his wife’s absence, but more likely it was his
ineptitude in dealing with practical details usually attended to by
Harriet. The supply of potatoes and bread seemed to diminish too
rapidly, the butcher’s bills seemed too high, two tons of coals had
lasted twelve weeks in the spring and summer of 1853 but a similar
quantity had surprisingly Edition: current; Page: [xxix] lasted only
nine weeks after November 12 (p. 136)! And then there were rats to be
coped with; his neighbour at Blackheath had sent a note to the effect
that rats dislodged from his own property had taken refuge in an
outhouse on Mill’s side. Mill could find no key to the outhouse. What to
do? Write Harriet, of course, who from France soon supplied the solution
to the problem (pp. 180, 182, 188).

Mill’s dependence on her at this time extended well beyond the problems
of domestic life. He seems seldom to have answered a letter without
consulting her about the form of the reply. One can understand why he
should have consulted her about replying to a complimentary note from
Mrs. Grote about his review of her husband’s book, for Mrs. Grote was
one of those they thought had gossiped about them. Harriet evidently
recommended a dignified silence. Mill thought it rather strange that
Grote, with whom he had been on close terms for years, did not perceive
that Mill was now addressing him as Mr. Grote (pp. 123 and 133). Other
replies to letters hardly requiring such delicacy of decorum
nevertheless were not sent until Harriet had been consulted. When the
legislature of South Carolina sent him a presentation copy of a book by
John C. Calhoun (pp. 142-43), when the Christian Socialist Frederick
Furnivall wanted to reprint from the Political Economy the chapter on
the future of the labouring classes (p. 149), and when Sir Charles
Trevelyan requested an opinion on a plan for the reform of the Civil
Service (pp. 175, 178, 184), the replies all required Harriet’s advice
and approval.

Harriet’s role in the early version of the Autobiography has been
described; she was also consulted at almost every turn in his writings
of this period. She contributed three “beautiful” sentences to the essay
on Nature (p. 144). When that was completed, he asked her to tell him
what to attempt next:

I will just copy the list of subjects we made out in the confused order
in which we put them down. Differences of character (nation, race, age,
sex, temperament). Love. Education of tastes. Religion de l’Avenir.
Plato. Slander. Foundation of morals. Utility of religion. Socialism.
Liberty. Doctrine that causation is will. To these I have now added from
your letter: Family, & Conventional

(p. 152).

Harriet in reply recommended “The Utility of Religion” in a sentence
that revealed that the subject was one close to her heart (p. 165, n.
3). He consulted her about revisions of the Political Economy for a new
edition (pp. 185-87, 195). There is no evidence that he ever asked her
help for more than verbal changes in revising the Logic (a very “dry”
book, she wrote her brother Arthur, which to her surprise continued to
sell well). Mill accepted readily her suggestion that he decline John
Chapman’s invitation to review Harriet Martineau’s abridged translation
of Comte’s Philosophie Positive, for he had long disliked Miss Martineau
(pp. 126 and 134). His wife’s dominance in the choice of topics to write
upon in this period seems clear, Edition: current; Page: [xxx] and even
after her death her influence continued to guide his choice of political
and social subjects; only in his writings on philosophical and
psychological questions does her influence as a motivating force seem to
have been minimal.

Harriet was a rebel not without cause. In Mill she found a man whose
extraordinary education had shaped him also for rebellion against the
social, moral, and political conventions of his time. In him she found
too a man almost desperately lonely, subject to recurring periods of
depression. It is perhaps small wonder that in gratitude for her braving
the censure of society, for her sharing in his devotion to liberal
causes, and for her strengthening of his spiritual and emotional
resources, he sought to induce the world to accept his estimate of her.
Neither he nor some of his recent biographers have convinced us that she
was the originating mind behind his work, but no one can doubt her
importance in his inner life, the well-springs of which had been
threatened by drought.

The other two series of Mill’s letters to Harriet, because they are
essentially travel letters, are less revealing. The travel on both trips
was undertaken in the hope of recovering his health. In the last letter
(Letter 154) of the earlier series to Harriet he had confessed that his
doctor had at last told him that he had an advanced case of consumption.
He was too ill to go to Paris to accompany Harriet and Helen when they
returned to England about the middle of April, 1854. Thereafter, his
health deteriorated rapidly and he lost weight at an alarming rate.
Yielding to the advice of his physicians, he left England on June 9,
1854, for a trip to Brittany by way of the Channel Islands. Fifteen of
his letters to Harriet during his six-week absence have survived.
Although, as he admitted a year later, he thought his death was
imminent, he kept up a brave front for Harriet. He focused attention
upon plans for retirement to the Continent: “I suppose we shall never
again live in England permanently” (p. 223). Everywhere he went he made
inquiries about the cost of living and reported the prices of food in
the various towns. He took his cod liver oil regularly, but his
favourite remedy for his health was walking: “I am always out of doors,
& walking when not travelling” (p. 218). A walk of twenty or more miles
a day even in his weakened condition was not uncommon. Gradually he
began to take on some weight and when he returned home in late July his
condition seemed improved.

With the approach of winter, however, more travel seemed necessary.
Leaving Harriet at Torquay with her mother and sister as guests, Mill
left England on December 8 for a trip of over six months to southern
France, Italy, Sicily, and Greece, not rejoining Harriet until he met
her in Paris in mid-June. The 49 letters he wrote her during his travels
can be read with interest in themselves, apart from their contributions
to any further understanding of their relationship. They are the letters
of a highly intelligent Edition: current; Page: [xxxi] observer, and
those written from Sicily and Greece in particular are valuable for
their pictures of wild country not often visited in the mid-nineteenth
century by Englishmen. The railroads had not yet reached those areas,
and the difficulties of travel by the public diligences, by mule, and on
foot were great enough to deter many a healthier traveller than Mill,
who had been almost at the point of death only six months earlier. Since
the letters are written to his wife, they of course recount in some
detail the progress of his health, his gains or losses in weight
whenever he finds available scales, his persistent bouts with
indigestion, and the gradually improving condition of his lungs.
Addicted to long walks since boyhood, he now almost literally walked
himself back to health, travelling often through wild country in Sicily
and Greece, climbing mountains and fording streams, often in pelting
rain, and always botanizing as he went along, collecting loads of
specimens which he dried and sorted in the evenings. Many of the inns
were primitive, and infested with fleas. Writing from Greece on May 26,
he wryly described one of his bouts with the pests:

I never saw so many fleas in the whole of my precious life, as I found
on my clothes & body on undressing last night. After chasing them one by
one I laid the palm of my hand over six or seven at once. During the
night they danced a saraband on my face, & I fancied I could hear the
sounds of myriads of them jumping on the floor: but perhaps it was only
the droppings of the swallows, for there are always swallows in these
places; the people think them lucky; & they often fly about in the
night, as these did. In the morning while I was sponging myself nearly a
dozen of the enemy gathered on my legs & feet. What is worse, I have
brought a colony of them with me to this comparatively clean place, &
they are tormenting me worse than ever. One little rascal had the
impudence to bite my hand to my very face

(p. 463).

Away from the cities he recounts the breathtaking beauty of the natural
scenery: near Vaucluse in Southern France (p. 267); near Chiaramonte in
Sicily (pp. 381-82), where the view from the hills and mountains is such
that “one feels lifted out of all the littleness of it & conscious of a
beauty which seems lent to it by something grander”; near Mount
Pentelicus in Greece, where “The more than earthly beauty of this
country quite takes away from me all care or feeling about the
historical associations, which I had so strongly in Syracuse. That I
shall have when I read Greek history again after becoming acquainted
with the localities” (p. 429). Despite this statement he is almost
always eager to associate literature and history with the places he
visits; in Bordeaux, in preparation for Italy, he buys a volume which
contains the poetry of Dante, Petrarch, Ariosto, and Tasso (p. 251); in
Sicily he reads the native poets Theocritus, Bion, and Moschus (p. 401),
as well as Goethe’s Italian travels (p. 339), and he saves Sophocles for
Greece (p. 401).

In Rome and the cities of northern Italy he performs zestfully “the
first Edition: current; Page: [xxxii] duty of man when in Italy, that of
seeing pictures” (p. 270). He had never before been so “immersed in
pictures” (p. 312). He is modest about his pretension in venturing to
give his opinions on the paintings, sculpture, and architecture he sees,
but “as all I say about them is the expression of real feelings which
they give or which they fail to give me, what I say though superficial
is genuine & may go for what it is worth—it does not come from books or
from other people . . .” (p. 312). He protests against prudery: “the
precious King of Naples has shut up the Venus Callipyge & the other
Venuses on pretext of public decency—the Pope has done the same to the
Venus of the Capitol. If these things are done in Italy what shall we
come to next?” (p. 317). Although Mill’s education had been defective
with respect to art (as had the education of most Englishmen of his
time), he now began to gain confidence in his judgments. “I find the
pleasure which pictures & statues give me increases with every new
experience, & I am acquiring strong preferences & discriminations which
with me I think is a sign of progress” (p. 295).

In the midst of his new-found pleasures in art and of the renewal of his
joy in natural beauty, Mill nonetheless never strayed very far from the
consciousness of his duty to write for the betterment of mankind. “We
have got a power of which we must try to make a good use during the few
years of life we have left” (p. 332). In Rome he was moved to recall a
paper he had written for his volume of essays he had projected with
Harriet:

I came back to an idea we have talked about & thought that the best
thing to write & publish at present would be a volume on Liberty. So
many things might be brought into it & nothing seems to me more
needed—it is a growing need too, for opinion tends to encroach more &
more on liberty, & almost all the projects of social reformers in these
days are really liberticide—Comte, particularly so. I wish I had brought
with me here the paper on liberty that I wrote for our volume of
Essays—perhaps my dearest will kindly read it through & tell me whether
it will do as the foundation of one part of the volume in question—If
she thinks so I will try to write & publish it in 1856 if my health
permits as I hope it will

(p. 294).

He revived also a plan he had thought of as early as 1839 (see Earlier
Letters, p. 411) to publish a collection of his periodical essays.

It seems desirable to do it in our lifetime, for I fancy we cannot
prevent other people from doing it when we are dead . . . : now if we do
it, we can exclude what we should not choose to republish, & nobody
would think of reprinting what the writer had purposely rejected. Then
the chance of the name selling them is as great as it is ever likely to
be—the collection would probably be a good deal reviewed, for anybody
thinks he can review a miscellaneous collection but few a treatise on
logic or political economy. . . . I hope to publish some volume almost
annually for the next few years if I live as long—& I should like to get
this reprint, if it is to be done at all, off my hands during the next
few months after I return in Edition: current; Page: [xxxiii] which
India House business being in arrear will prevent me from settling
properly to the new book. Will my dearest one think about this & tell me
what her judgment & also what her feeling is

(p. 348).

As it turned out, however, Mill did not publish another book until the
year after Harriet’s death in November, 1858. It was not merely the
arrears of India House business that delayed the fulfilment of his
plans; on him was placed the burden of the defence of the Company
against the takeover of the administration of India by the British
government in 1858. After his retirement and the death of his wife, he
published in close succession in 1859 the essay On Liberty, his pamphlet
on Parliamentary Reform, and the first two volumes of his review
articles, Dissertations and Discussions.

Again during his 1855 trip he was concerned about his approaching
retirement. Almost every place he went he noted its cost of living and
its suitability as a home for them. Corfu and the nearby islands,
curiously enough, seemed most attractive, especially when the
possibility developed that he might be able to secure an appointment as
Resident of one of the Ionian islands then under British protection (p.
412).

I do not believe there is a more beautiful place in the world & few more
agreeable—the burthen of it to us would be that we could not (with the
Residentship) have the perfectly quiet life, with ourselves & our own
thoughts, which we prefer to any other, but if we have tolerable health
there is not more of societyzing than would be endurable & if we have
not, that would excuse us

(p. 420).

Isolation from English society, so long as it was shared with Harriet,
would be no deprivation for him. To lose her would be the unthinkable
calamity. That he might do something that would alienate her from him
seems to have been a deeply rooted fear, a fear that once near the end
of his long absence from her gained expression in a letter.

. . . I had a horrible dream lately—I had come back to her & she was
sweet & loving like herself at first, but presently she took a complete
dislike to me saying that I was changed much for the worse—I am terribly
afraid sometimes lest she should think so, not that I see any cause for
it, but because I know how deficient I am in self consciousness & self
observation, & how often when she sees me again after I have been even a
short time absent she is disappointed—but she shall not be, she will not
be so I think this time—bless my own darling, she has been all the while
without intermission present to my thoughts & I have been all the while
mentally talking with her when I have not been doing so on paper

(p. 476).

The three years following Mill’s return to Harriet in June, 1855, seem
to have been happy. Their health was somewhat improved and no further
prolonged separations occurred. As a result, of course, we have little
record in letters of their life together for this period. Only
occasionally in these years were letters necessary, ordinarily brief
ones. In the summer of 1856, accompanied by Helen and Algernon Taylor,
they spent much of July and August Edition: current; Page: [xxxiv] in
Switzerland and were apart only for a week while Mill took a walking
tour of the French Jura. In September, 1857, and July, 1858, he made
several botanizing expeditions, each of about a week’s duration. The
longest separation during these years occurred in February, 1857, when
Harriet went to Scotland to be near her daughter Helen, who in the
preceding November had won her mother’s very reluctant consent to her
undertaking a career as an actress. She was permitted to do so only on
the understanding that the Taylor name should be concealed; she billed
herself as Miss Trevor. To conceal Helen’s whereabouts, Harriet went to
great pains; for all her protests against social convention, she wanted
to avoid the stigma still attached to the theatrical profession and to
preserve appearances for herself and her daughter.

The last years of Mill’s marriage continued the isolation that had
characterized his life with Harriet. One notices the paucity of his
correspondence in these years as well as of publication. Old friends,
like the Grotes, were still kept at a distance; there is no record of
the Mills’ entertaining any friends except Louis Blanc, who, as a
radical French journalist, was outside the pale of respectable society.
It seems more than likely that if Mill’s and Harriet’s plans for their
retirement had been carried out, his isolation from English life would
have continued. Not that he would have minded, for to the end Harriet
was the all-sufficient centre of his existence. If Harriet could have
lived, he would gladly have foregone the public fame he was later to
achieve.

When she died in Avignon on November 3, 1858, the blow to him was all
but overwhelming. To his friend and former colleague at the India House,
W. T. Thornton, he wrote:

It is doubtful if I shall ever be fit for anything public or private,
again. The spring of my life is broken. But I shall best fulfil her
wishes by not giving up the attempt to do something useful, and I am not
quite alone. I have with me her daughter, the one person besides myself
who most loved her & whom she most loved, & we help each other to bear
what is inevitable

(p. 574).

By the end of the month, before he and Helen returned to England, he had
purchased a cottage at St. Véran near the Avignon cemetery in which
Harriet was buried. The cottage was henceforth to be his and Helen’s
real home, although they usually spent about half of each year in
England in the house in Blackheath Park, which they retained until 1872.
The tie that bound them to Avignon was, of course, the nearby grave of
Harriet, which became virtually a shrine. For the rest of his life,
whenever he was at Avignon, Mill visited the site for an hour each day.

The shared loss of Harriet brought Mill and Helen into an association
that was to strengthen over the remaining years of his life. In many
ways he became heavily dependent upon her. She seems to have accepted
the burden willingly and without regret at giving up her hoped-for
career in the theatre. From the first she devoted herself to Mill’s
comforts, interests, and causes.

Edition: current; Page: [xxxv]
He soon became as dependent upon her as he had been upon Harriet. This
is best seen in the series of his letters to Helen of January and
February, 1860, apparently his only extended separation from her in his
last fifteen years, occasioned by his return to Blackheath to consult
his physicians and settle some business affairs, while she remained in
Avignon. As in his letters to Harriet, he keeps Helen informed about the
medical advice he has received (p. 660). He forwards certain letters to
her (as formerly to Harriet) to consult her on the replies to be made
(p. 661). In practical matters—for instance, when the walls in their
Blackheath house begin to threaten collapse—he still depends on the
woman of the house for instructions (pp. 662, 666). It is Helen who is
responsible for the home at Avignon, at one point supervising the
building of an addition. Under her skilful ministrations, the cottage at
Avignon became not only a comfortable refuge from the society in which
he had been in the past seldom at ease but also the place where he was
henceforth to carry on most of his study and his writing.

In November, 1861, he wrote his friend Thornton:

Life here is uneventful, and feels like a perpetual holiday. It is one
of the great privileges of advanced civilization, that while keeping out
of the turmoil and depressing wear of life, one can have brought to
one’s doors all that is agreeable or stimulating in the activities of
the outward world, by newspapers, new books, periodicals, &c. It is, in
truth, too self-indulgent a life for any one to allow himself whose
duties lie among his fellow-beings, unless, as is fortunately the case
with me, they are mostly such as can better be fulfilled at a distance
from their society, than in the midst of it

(p. 747).

Mill was aware of the dangers to Helen in his virtual monopoly of her
attention. Once when she had evidently complained of being depressed by
the company of some women at Avignon, he wrote her:

It is a great happiness to me to be a support to you under depression,
but it would be very painful to me to think that I should always
continue to be the only one, as I must necessarily fail you some day & I
can never be at ease unless, either by means of persons or of pursuits
you have some other resource besides me, and I am sure my own darling
[Harriet] would feel as I do

(p. 677).

Helen continued, however, to devote herself almost exclusively to Mill’s
interests. By 1865, as has been pointed out in the Preface, she became
so identified with him as to be able to write a good many of his letters
for him. Of a letter on women’s suffrage to Mary Carpenter, he wrote:

. . . I should not like to be a party to its being printed with my name,
because it was written (as is the case with no inconsiderable portion of
my correspondence) by my step-daughter Miss Helen Taylor. Without this
help it would be impossible for me to carry on so very voluminous a
correspondence as I am at present able to do: and we are so completely
one in our opinions and feelings, that it makes hardly any difference
which of us puts them into words

(p. 1359).

Edition: current; Page: [xxxvi]
By her own admission, Helen was, like her mother before her, a severe
critic of Mill’s writing. In turn, she reproached him for not
criticizing her own writing severely enough. Mill thought her a good
editor and trusted her judgment in the revision of his work. She worked
zealously, “putting in words here, stops there; scratching through whole
paragraphs; asking him to write whole new pages in particular places”
where she thought the meaning unclear.4 Her relationship with Mill was
such that there was “no amour propre to be hurt in his case or [hers].”

On at least one occasion she gave him a thorough dressing down for
careless thinking and writing. When in a public letter to his election
committee in the 1868 campaign for Parliament, Mill wrote effusively and
somewhat evasively in defence of his support of the atheist Charles
Bradlaugh, Helen, in a letter of November 12, 1868 (MS at LSE), sternly
warned Mill that his “future power of usefulness on religious liberty”
was being jeopardized by such letters, and that henceforth she would
take charge of any correspondence about Bradlaugh: “Copy as literally as
you can the letter I dictated (which I enclose) about Bradlaugh; and
what you yourself said at the former election, about yourself.”5

Helen’s judgment in this instance was probably sound, but in other
instances she seems to have brought Mill too much under her domination.
When in 1869 the identity of the London Committee for Women’s Suffrage
(originally Helen’s project) was threatened with a takeover by a
Manchester group, Helen through Mill directed countermoves for the
London Committee. In a series of letters to George Croom Robertson, Mill
was led to advocate measures designed to eliminate dissident members
from the Committee and to ensure that new members should be on the right
side. This series of letters to Robertson is the only one in all his
correspondence that reflects discredit upon Mill the advocate of freedom
of opinion. Helen was so convinced of the rightness of her views that
she became almost ruthless in her support of them.

Her evident domination of Mill in matters connected with the women’s
suffrage movement did not escape the observation of one of Mill’s
friends, Charles Eliot Norton, who wrote to Chauncey Wright on September
13, 1870:

I doubt whether Mill’s interest in the cause of woman is serviceable to
him as a thinker. It has a tendency to develop the sentimental part of
his intelligence, which is of immense force, and has only been kept in
due subjection by his respect for his own reason. This respect
diminishes under the powerful influence of his daughter, Miss Taylor,
who is an admirable person doubtless, but is what, were Edition:
current; Page: [xxxvii] she of the sex that she regards as inferior,
would be called decidedly priggish. Her self-confidence, which embraces
her confidence in Mill, is tremendous, and Mill is overpowered by it.
Her words have an oracular value to him—something more than their just
weight; and her unconscious flattery, joined with the very direct
flattery of many other prominent leaders of the great female army, have
a not unnatural effect on his tender, susceptible and sympathetic
nature. . . .6

However dominant Helen may have become over Mill in his last years, her
help to him in restoring his will to live and in developing new
interests in the years immediately after Harriet’s death was of great
importance. She encouraged him to make new friends, held frequent
intimate dinner parties when they were at Blackheath, and shared his
enthusiasm for new causes which he found he could advance better by
ending the isolation he had enjoyed with Harriet. The first steps were
taken somewhat reluctantly. He wrote to Helen in February, 1860, after
meeting with Thomas Hare and Henry Fawcett:

The truth is that though I detest society for society’s sake yet when I
can do anything for the public objects I care about by seeing & talking
with people I do not dislike it. At the moment of going to do it, I feel
it a bore, just as I do taking a walk or anything else that I must &
ought to do when not wishing to do it. But I believe the little
additional activity & change of excitement does me good, & that it is
better for me to try to serve my opinions in other ways as well as with
a pen in my hand

(p. 675).

The products of his pen, especially the shorter works published in
1859—On Liberty, Thoughts on Parliamentary Reform, and the first two
volumes of his Dissertations and Discussions—were beginning to have
evident effect upon public opinion. He noted that an article in the
conservative Quarterly Review had borrowed from his pamphlet on
parliamentary reform (p. 667), and he wrote Helen in February, 1860,
that his influence could be detected in the likewise conservative
Saturday Review, “for besides that they are continually referring to me
by name, I continually detect the influence of some idea that they have
lately got from the Dissertations. They must also get me plenty of
readers, for they are always treating me & my influence as something of
very great importance” (pp. 673-74). Early in 1863 he corrected an
American reviewer who thought that his shorter works had been neglected
in England in comparison with his treatises. The more recent works “have
been much more widely read than ever those were & have given me what I
had not before, popular influence” (p. 843). That influence had also
markedly increased in America and was reenforced by his wholehearted
support of the Northern cause during the Civil War.

His active participation in political and social movements revived in
the Edition: current; Page: [xxxviii] early 1860’s and is reflected both
in the addition of new friendships and correspondences and in the
renewing of old. Only seven letters to Edwin Chadwick, his early friend,
are extant for the years between 1849 and November, 1858; there are
nearly a hundred in the years to 1873. The friendship with Grote, broken
off during the years of Mill’s marriage, was renewed, as well as their
correspondence. The exchange of letters with Gustave d’Eichthal,
interrupted in 1842, began again in 1863. Although evidence is
incomplete, it seems likely that the correspondence with Alexander Bain
had also been almost wholly suspended during Mill’s marriage.

Among the new correspondents, John Elliot Cairnes became perhaps the one
most highly valued by Mill. In the earlier years of their
correspondence, they had little opportunity for personal contact, since
Cairnes resided in Ireland until 1866, when he became Professor of
Political Economy at University College, London; he eventually made his
home in Blackheath. Reference has been made earlier here to Mill’s
awareness that their exchanges constituted a “philosophic
correspondence” between two who shared a “brotherhood in arms.” Cairnes
is sometimes thought of as a disciple of Mill, but while he was in basic
agreement with Mill on many of their doctrines in political economy, he
often disagreed with the older man in details. His criticism was often
of great help to Mill in the revision of his Political Economy, and on
some questions, notably on those relating to Ireland, Cairnes supplied
invaluable information. Mill, in turn, was often of similar assistance
to Cairnes (see, for instance, his analytical letter on the French
political economists, pp. 1664-65). It was Mill who first encouraged
Cairnes to expand some lectures he had delivered in Dublin into his book
The Slave Power, which became perhaps the most influential force in
shaping British opinion in favour of the North in the American Civil
War. The letters of the two men on the course of that war reveal their
mutual concern for the antislavery cause; said Mill, “the battle against
the devil could not be fought on a more advantageous field than that of
slavery” (p. 835). Other interests the two shared were proportional
representation, women’s rights, and the reform of education and land
tenure in Ireland. More than any other of Mill’s correspondence, except
perhaps that with Carlyle—the other side of which is largely
available—both sides of the Cairnes-Mill series deserve publication
together; for reasons of space, we have been able to publish only
pertinent excerpts of Cairnes’s letters in footnotes.

Of the other new friends, Thomas Hare supplied Mill with a new cause—the
representation of minorities or, as we now phrase it, proportional
representation. Mill responded enthusiastically when Hare sent him a
copy of his book on the subject: “You appear to me to have exactly, and
for the first time, solved the difficulty of popular representation; and
by doing so, to have raised up the cloud of gloom and uncertainty which
hung over the futurity of Edition: current; Page: [xxxix] representative
government and therefore of civilization” (pp. 598-99). Mill’s
long-standing fear of the tyranny of the majority in a democratic
society was now allayed by the possibility of the representation of
minorities set forth in Hare’s plan. It became at once a favourite cause
for Mill, since he regarded the plan “as the sheet anchor of the
democracy of the future” (p. 765). Within a month after studying Hare’s
book he reviewed it enthusiastically in Fraser’s Magazine, and he
quickly revised his pamphlet on parliamentary reform to endorse the
plan. Hare became one of Mill’s valued friends and a dependable ally in
another favourite cause, women’s suffrage.

It was through Hare that Mill gained another friend, disciple, and
correspondent—the blind political economist and politician Henry
Fawcett, who was Mill’s junior by twenty-three years. He and Mill were
united in their support of Hare’s plan, co-operation, conservation,
women’s suffrage, and a number of other liberal causes. When Fawcett and
Mill were both elected to Parliament in 1865, they continued their
relationship as political allies. As a political economist, however,
Fawcett remained more orthodox than Mill, who in his later years moved
nearer to socialist views.

Less close was the relationship with Herbert Spencer, the extant
correspondence with whom dates from November, 1858, after Spencer had
written Mill for assistance in securing a position in the India civil
service. Prior to that, the two had engaged in amicable controversy in
their writings on the ultimate test of truth and Spencer’s “Universal
Postulate.” Mill’s answers to Spencer were largely expressed in
successive revisions of the Logic, beginning with the fourth edition.
Mill wrote Spencer that his First Principles was “a striking exposition
of a consistent and imposing system of thought; of which though I
dissent from much, I agree in more” (p. 846). Mill at times expressed
regret at having to criticize so often one whom he regarded as “a friend
and ally” (p. 1061). To Bain he wrote, “He is a considerable thinker
though anything but a safe one” (p. 901), certainly, in psychology, less
sound than Bain (p. 540). Nevertheless Mill readily supported Spencer’s
plans for a periodical, The Reader (pp. 974-75), and when Spencer
announced that he was planning to suspend the publication of his
Principles of Biology, Mill offered to guarantee a publisher against
loss in carrying on with it (p. 1145). At first, they differed in degree
rather than in principle on laissez-faire: Spencer opposed town
ownership of public parks, but Mill thought they should be the property
of the town (p. 609). Later, Mill’s increasing sympathy with socialism
must have widened the differences between the two, but their extant
correspondence supplies no evidence. Spencer, though early in favour of
women’s rights, changed his mind and refused to join Mill’s campaign for
women’s suffrage (p. 1299). Mill protested Spencer’s view that women
often tyrannize over men by remarking that here as in a great many other
cases “two negatives do not make an affirmative, or at all events two
Edition: current; Page: [xl] affirmatives do not make a negative and two
contradictory tyrannies do not make liberty” (p. 1614). Despite their
differences, however, the two philosophers remained on friendly terms,
and Spencer was invited from time to time to Mill’s home for dinner.
Spencer after Mill’s death wrote an appreciative memorial article for
the Examiner (reprinted as an Appendix in Spencer’s Autobiography).

A rare difficulty with a friend, arising out of a misunderstanding, is
illustrated in the letters to the young classical scholar Theodor
Gomperz, who had corresponded with Mill since 1854 about translating his
works into German. When Mill and Helen Taylor had visited Gomperz in
Vienna in the summer of 1862, the young man had fallen in love with
Helen. Mill’s friendly letters inviting him to visit them in England
were encouraging; he came to London the following winter, intending to
propose to Helen. She and Mill, apparently not aware of Gomperz’s
intentions, returned to Avignon before Gomperz made his hopes clear to
either one. His request to be allowed to visit them was answered by
Mill, apparently unconscious of Gomperz’s real purpose, on April 26,
1863 (Letter 607), in a rather ambiguous, cool manner. Gomperz took the
letter to be a rejection not only by Helen as a suitor but also by the
two of them as friends. His despair set off an incipient nervous
breakdown, in which he conjured up enemies who must be maligning him. In
succeeding letters Mill protested the sincerity of his great esteem and
respect for Gomperz, and after returning with Helen to London early in
June invited him to dinner. Mill was apparently slow to understand the
real desire of Gomperz; in guarded but kindly terms (Letter 618), Mill
advised him that he would “never willingly be the smallest obstacle” to
his wishes but clearly doubted that there was any hope.

If you think fit to carry the matter farther, either by speech or
writing,—even if only for the relief of your own feelings—, you will
have my truest sympathy, as you have my sincere friendship and
esteem.—We hope to see you and your friend to-morrow, and I hope,
nothing that has passed will make any difference in your feelings
towards us, who remain unchanged to you, and that you will not allow it
to affect in any degree our future intercourse

(p. 863).

Gomperz for some time after leaving England still suffered from
delusions of persecution, which Mill tried to dispel (see Letter 633).
By fall, Gomperz was calmer and he eventually recovered fully. The
correspondence with Mill was renewed; it continued on a friendly basis
until Mill’s death.

In the 1860’s with the growth of Mill’s reputation came a marked
increase in his influence among young men. His treatises on logic and
political economy had become textbooks in the universities, helping to
shape the thought as well as the methods of thinking of the younger
generation. Among his shorter works, On Liberty became, as Frederic
Harrison remarked, “a sort of gospel.” On perhaps none was his influence
greater than on John Edition: current; Page: [xli] Morley, whose
acquaintance Mill first made in 1865, when Morley at the age of
twenty-seven was a writer for various periodicals. An anonymous article
of his entitled “New Ideas” in the October 21, 1865, number of the
Saturday Review attracted Mill’s attention, and when a friend identified
the author of the piece, Mill wrote Morley: “Wherever I might have seen
that article, I should have felt a strong wish to know who was its
author, as it shows an unusual amount of qualities which go towards
making the most valuable kind of writer for the general public” (p.
1113). Their friendship developed quickly and by the fall of 1867 when
Morley travelled to America, Mill wrote to Emerson a letter of
introduction for him (Letter 1137), praising his great capacity and
promise as a writer. It is not possible to gauge from the letters to
Morley here published the full extent of Mill’s influence on him, for we
have succeeded in locating only eleven, some of them brief extracts.
Morley himself, however, in his memorial article, “The Death of Mr.
Mill” (FR, June, 1873) and in his Recollections (2 vols., New York,
1917), has recorded in generous terms his indebtedness to Mill as his
intellectual father. D. A. Hamer in his John Morley (Oxford, 1968, pp.
16-32) has delineated skilfully Mill’s role in winning Morley over from
Positivism. What we do have of Mill’s letters to him show Mill as an
adviser on questions of public policy, particularly with reference to
the Fortnightly Review, of which Morley became the editor in 1867. At
one point in 1870, fearful that Morley’s health was in danger from
overwork, Mill offered to take over temporarily the editorship of the
Review. Their personal contacts were frequent: Morley was always
welcomed to Blackheath. On March 5, 1873, Mill visited Morley for a day
at his home, shortly before Mill was to leave England for the last time.
Morley’s description of that day, reprinted in his Recollections (I,
66-67) from his memorial article of June, 1873, is the finest account
available of Mill’s wide-ranging, stimulating conversation.

Of his influence on another promising young man, Lord Amberley, son of
Lord John Russell, we again have little evidence in Mill’s letters. Only
seven have been located for inclusion here. Fortunately, they can be
supplemented by a number of Helen’s letters to Lady Amberley, preserved
at LSE and in the Russell Archive at McMaster University. Mill and Helen
first met Amberley at a dinner party at the Grotes’ on March 22, 1864,
and Amberley called on them at Avignon the following June. The
acquaintance ripened into friendship after Amberley’s marriage to Kate
Stanley in 1865. Helen and Kate Amberley became close friends. The young
couple visited Mill and Helen at Avignon and at Blackheath, and they in
turn visited the Amberleys at their home near Tintern Abbey in England.
Mill even agreed to become godfather for their second son, Bertrand
Russell. Mill served as an adviser to Amberley both on his writings and
on his political activities. Amberley, who was frequently attacked in
The Times and other newspapers for his extreme Edition: current; Page:
[xlii] radical opinions, won Mill’s sympathetic support, as is seen in
his letter of November 30, 1868 (pp. 1494-95), discussing both his and
Amberley’s defeat in the 1868 elections for Parliament.

In those same elections, the third of the young men who became one of
Mill’s close friends, Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, won a seat for
Chelsea. Mill was not then acquainted with Dilke. Their acquaintance
began in 1869 with Mill’s writing Dilke a friendly but detailed
criticism of his new book, Greater Britain, based on travels in many
parts of the Empire (Letter 1693). Years later, Dilke himself wrote an
account of their subsequent friendship and published excerpts from
Mill’s letters to him.7 In this instance we presumably have most if not
all of Mill’s letters, preserved in Dilke’s papers at the British
Museum. The letters reveal Mill after his defeat in 1868 quite as deeply
interested in current political questions as when he was in the House.
Still a public figure, he found that his widened knowledge of the
working classes contributed to his understanding of their problems. In
the last four years of his life he increasingly took positions farther
to the left than those he had occupied in his Parliamentary years. Long
interested in land reform, he now moved to organize the Land Tenure
Reform Association. His sympathies with the trades unions deepened, and
his confidence in their leaders increased. He met regularly in 1869 with
a committee organized to promote working-class representation in
Parliament. He became an ardent advocate of universal free education,
despite his earlier fears about state-maintained education. At Dilke’s
invitation he and Helen became members of the Radical Club, a dining and
discussion group started by Henry Fawcett, which met every other Sunday
during the Parliamentary session. About half of the Club were radical or
ultra-liberal members of Parliament. On occasion Mill advised Dilke on
strategy to be followed in supporting the liberal causes they both
advocated, including women’s rights. The two entertained each other at
dinner from time to time, and it was to this intimate friendship that we
owe the existence of the Watts portrait of Mill (see Letter 1780). Dilke
persuaded Mill to sit for the portrait, paid the artist, and eventually
bequeathed it to the City of Westminster.

Although Mill in his last years added such young men as Morley,
Amberley, and Dilke to the roster of his friends and correspondents, he
still maintained his correspondence with a number of his longtime
friends. The oldest of these friendships was with Edwin Chadwick, dating
back to their Benthamite days. Mill’s earliest extant letter to Chadwick
is dated February 19, 1827; the last, December 27, 1872. Over those
forty-five years the two were apparently in close touch, for many of the
letters, especially in the earlier years, are brief notes concerning
matters previously discussed in Edition: current; Page: [xliii] person.
Chadwick relied upon Mill as a reader of his many reports as a reformer
of the poor laws, sanitation, education—sometimes it seems as a reformer
of almost everything. Mill always admired the matter of Chadwick’s
reports and usually supported the proposed reforms; the writing of the
reports, however, Mill time after time found in need of reorganization
and even of grammatical correction. In the 1860’s when Chadwick
published a cheap paper for the working classes, The Penny Newsman, Mill
and Helen Taylor contributed articles. The best testimony to Mill’s
admiration and respect for Chadwick’s abilities is to be found in the
unremitting efforts he made to fulfil Chadwick’s ambition to be elected
to Parliament. Mill thought him admirably equipped for service there. In
1868 he characterized Chadwick as

one of the organizing & contriving minds of the age; a class of minds of
which there are very few, & still fewer who apply those qualities to the
practical business of government. He is, moreover, one of the few
persons who have a passion for the public good; and nearly the whole of
his time is devoted to it, in one form or another

(p. 1432).

When Mill himself was being considered for the representation of
Westminster, he constantly put forth the case for Chadwick, in
preference to himself, and later, when in Parliament, Mill was always
looking for possible openings for him. What appeared to be the best
chance for Chadwick came in the 1868 campaign when it appeared possible
that he might unseat Edward Bouverie, an Adullamite Liberal who for
twenty-five years had represented the Scottish constituency of
Kilmarnock. Because Bouverie had openly attacked Gladstone and the
Liberal party the preceding spring, Mill thought him not entitled to
Liberal support and instead warmly endorsed Chadwick. Bouverie charged
Mill with sowing dissension in the party, and turned over to The Times
for publication his exchange of letters with Mill (see Letters 1299 and
1306). In the event, Chadwick, who had campaigned vigorously and at
considerable expense to himself, lost badly to Bouverie. Mill had to
answer a bitter letter from Mrs. Chadwick protesting his encouraging her
husband to run (Letter 1335). Neither her protest nor his own defeat
deterred Mill, as his later letters to Chadwick reveal, from continuing
to support his friend.

We have dwelt at some length on the foregoing correspondences with both
earlier and later friends because they are among the most revealing of
Mill’s character and personality. Other series, however, deserve at
least brief mention here. Readers who wish to pursue any of the various
series will find convenient the separate Index of Correspondents in Vol.
XVII. Mill’s continuing, widely ranging interest in developments outside
England is demonstrated in such series as those to his friends Gustave
d’Eichthal and Charles Dupont-White on developments in France, both
before and after the Franco-Prussian Edition: current; Page: [xliv] war
of 1870; to Pasquale Villari, on the long struggle for Italian
independence; to Henry S. Chapman in New Zealand, on affairs in that
remote portion of the Empire; and to Charles Eliot Norton in America on
post-Civil War problems. The two series of his letters to working-class
correspondents, John Plummer and William Wood, reveal his essential
kindness; without any trace of condescension he lent them books, gave
them advice, and sought their support for his favourite causes,
especially that of women’s rights. The letters to Alexander Bain and to
Rowland G. Hazard provide valuable supplements to Mill’s philosophical
and metaphysical writings. The letters to W. T. Thornton, his long-time
colleague at the India House, display not only their warm friendship but
also their continuing debates on such economic questions as the
wage-fund doctrine and trades unions and such philosophic questions as
utilitarianism. Letters to William E. Hickson and John Chapman,
successively editors of the Westminster Review, reveal not only his
continuing interest in the radical review with which he had been closely
associated in its earlier years, but also his readiness to contribute to
its financial support. Letters to his publishers, John W. Parker and his
successor William Longman, show Mill the author fully aware of the value
of his publications and determined to obtain a fair return for them, but
also willing to sacrifice to the public good his own profits by making
available inexpensive People’s editions of his works.

We have chosen in this Introduction to emphasize the value of the many
series of Mill’s letters in gaining an understanding of his life and
personality, rather than to attempt to provide an analysis of his views
on the many questions he explored in both letters and published works.
The latter have been subjected, and are still being subjected, to
searching analysis in many books and articles, for Mill continues to be
one of the most significant of Victorian writers for the twentieth
century. Some of his letters express views not to be found in his
published writings, views that often seem surprisingly modern. Well
known, of course, is his dedicated support of women’s rights. Less well
known are his concern for the environment (see Letter 909), his eventual
acceptance of universal education provided by the State (see Letter
1534), and his foresighted opinions on the Negro problem in America (see
Letter 871). For the reader who wishes to pursue these and other topics
in the letters, we have provided a detailed subject index. It is our
hope that readers will share the pleasure that the editors have had not
only in observing Mill engage with ideas but also in obtaining new
insights into the nature of the man himself. The whole correspondence is
the life of the man, “and above all the chief part of his life, his
inner life.”

I have just finished reading the two volumes2 with the greatest pleasure

The fifth volume seems to me all that we had a right to expect, and the
sixth is splendid!

I mean to read them again at leisure, and I shall then note one or two
very small points to talk about, which I do not now remember.

Every great result which you have attempted to deduce seems to me most
thoroughly made out.

You might well feel that the handwriting would be “worth having”, but
instead of there being “little said” the excessive sweetness & love in
this Edition: current; Page: [4] exquisite letter makes it like
something dropt from heaven. I had been literally pining for it & had
got into a state of depression which I do not think I shall fall into
again during this absence—When I left you my darling & during all the
journey back3 I was full of life & animation & vigour of wish & purpose,
because fresh from being with you, fresh from the immediate influence of
your blessed presence & of that extreme happiness of that time which
during this last week or fortnight I have hardly been able to conceive
that I ever had—much less that I ever should have again—but this angel
letter has begun to bring back happiness & spirit & I again begin to
feel the holiday & journey & that blessed meeting as if they would
really be—& to feel capable also of being & of doing something in the
meanwhile which I had entirely ceased to feel. But I am very anxious
darling to hear about the lameness4 & to find that it has got better. I
have a very strong feeling about the obstinacy of lamenesses from the
troublesome persistency of this of mine5—though it is certainly
better—but still it does not go away, nor allow me to take more than a
very little exercise & I feel the effect a little now in the general
health—the sight too has not quite recovered itself yet, which is an
additional teaze, but I am not uneasy about it. The only piece of news I
have is that Austin6 called yesterday. When he came & during all the
time he Edition: current; Page: [5] staid there was a Frenchman with me,
a man named Guerry,7 a statistical man whom Col. Sykes8 brought to
me—the man whose maps of France with the dark & light colours, shewing
the state of crime, instruction &c. in each department you may remember.
He was [wanting?] to shew me some other maps & tables of his & to ask me
about the “logic” of his plans so he did not go away—& the talk was
confined to general subjects, except that Austin said he was going to
prepare a new edition of his book on jurisprudence9 on a much enlarged
plan & should wish very much to consult me on various matters connected
with the application of induction to moral science. Of course I could
not refuse & indeed saw no reason for doing so—but as this will lead to
his coming again, sending MSS. & so on it both gives an occasion &
creates a necessity for defining the relation I am to stand in with
respect to them. He said he had after much difficulty & search taken a
house at Weybridge & that he liked the place, but he did not (I have no
doubt purposely) say anything about wishing that I would visit him
there, or anywhere. His talk was free & éclairé as it always is with me,
much of it about that new publication of Guizot10 (which I have not
read) of which he spoke very disparagingly & defended communists11 &
socialists against the attacks contained in it & said he saw no real
objection to socialism except the difficulty if not impracticability of
managing so great a concern as the industry of a whole country in the
way of association. Nothing was said about her12 or about the copy of
the Pol. Ec.13 but it is necessary to prendre un parti. What should it
be? I am reading Macaulay’s book:14 it is in some Edition: current;
Page: [6] respects better than I expected, & in none worse. I think the
best character that can be given of it is that it is a man without
genius, who has observed what people of genius do when they write
history, & tries his very best to do the same, without the amount of
painful effort, & affectation, which you might expect, & which I did
expect from such an attempt & such a man. I have no doubt like all his
writings it will be & continue popular—it is exactly au niveau of the
ideal of shallow people with a touch of the new ideas—& it is not
sufficiently bad to induce anybody who knows better to take pains to
lower people’s estimation of it. I perceive no very bad tendency in it
as yet, except that it in some degree ministers to English
conceit15—only in some degree, for he never “goes the whole” in
anything. He is very characteristic & so is his book, of the English
people & of his time. I am rather glad than not that he is writing the
history of that time for it is just worth reading when made (as he does
make it) readable: though in itself I think English one of the least
interesting of all histories—(French perhaps the most & certainly the
most instructive in so far as history is ever so).

As to Jane’s2 money—there is certainly a strong inducement to transfer
it to the French funds, as it would about double the income & if
invested as proposed in her own name & that of the trustees it would be
as exclusively in her own control as at present & she could receive the
interest. It can only be done by sending out a power of attorney to be
executed by you. But it seems to me that now when there seems so much
chance of your not being able to live in England where alone you could
act, it would be very desirable to put in a third trustee along with the
present two, both for Jane’s and Mary’s3 property. I will suggest this
to them & ascertain the proper way of doing it. The buying of French
stock, if you determine to do it, ought not Edition: current; Page: [7]
to be done through Ferraboschi,4 but it can be done by an agent here &
this I can see to if it is ultimately decided to do it.

Dear Hickson,

Many thanks for the Guizot2 which I have had read to me (for I am
obliged to spare my sight which is ailing a good deal).3 I find it far
inferior to what I expected—so vague and general as to be almost
intangible, and it hardly comes into collision at all with what I think
it necessary to say, in answer to Brougham.4 I do not think I can make
any use of it on this occasion. The article5 however is in itself a
complete answer to all such diatribes. It is finished, except revision,
which the state of my sight alone retards. I will however, “make an
effort” (vide chap.1 of Dombey)6 and let you have it soon.

Yours ever truly,

J. S. Mill

I should like to know who wrote the article on Channing7 if it is no

I received your dear letter 11 on Saturday & this morning the first
instalment of the Pol. Ec.2 This last I will send again (or as much of
it as is necessary) when I have been able to make up my mind about it.
The objections are I think very inconsiderable as to quantity—much less
than I expected—but that paragraph, p. 248, in the first edit. which you
object to so strongly & totally,3 is what has always seemed to me the
strongest part of the argument (it is only what even Proudhon says
against Communism)4—& as omitting it after it has once been printed
would imply a change of opinion, it is necessary to see whether the
opinion has changed or not—yours has, in some respects at least, for you
have marked strong dissent from the passage that “the necessaries of
life when secure for the whole of life are Edition: current; Page: [9]
scarcely more a subject of consciousness”5 &c. which was inserted on
your proposition & very nearly in your words. This is probably only the
progress we have been always making, & by thinking sufficiently I should
probably come to think the same—as is almost always the case, I believe
always when we think long enough. But here the being unable to discuss
verbally stands sadly in the way, & I am now almost convinced that as
you said at first, we cannot settle this 2d edit. by letter. We will
try, but I now feel almost certain that we must adjourn the publication
of the 2d edit. to November.6 In the new matter one of the sentences
that you have cancelled is a favorite of mine, viz “It is probable that
this will finally depend upon considerations not to be measured by the
coarse standard which in the present state of human improvement is the
only one that can be applied to it.”7 What I meant was that whether
individual agency or Socialism would be best ultimately—(both being
necessarily very imperfect now, & both susceptible of immense
improvement) will depend on the comparative attractions they will hold
out to human beings with all their capacities, both individual & social,
infinitely more developed than at present. I do not think it is English
improvement only that is too backward to enable this point to be
ascertained for if English character is starved in its social part I
think Continental is as much or even more so in its individual, &
Continental people incapable of entering into the feelings which make
very close contact with crowds of other people both disagreeable &
mentally & morally lowering. I cannot help thinking that something like
what I meant by the sentence, ought to be said though I can imagine good
reasons for your disliking the way in which it is put. Then again if the
sentence “the majority would not exert themselves for anything beyond
this & unless they did nobody else would &c”8 is not tenable, then all
the two or three pages of argument which precede & of which this is but
the summary, are false, & there is nothing to be said against Communism
at all—one would only have to turn round & advocate it—which if done
would be better in a separate treatise & would be a great objection to
publishing a 2d edit. until after such a treatise. I think I agree in
all the other remarks. Fourrier [sic]9 if I may judge by Considérant10
is perfectly right about women Edition: current; Page: [10] both as to
equality & marriage—& I suspect that Fourier himself went further than
his disciple thinks prudent in the directness of his recommendations.
Considérant sometimes avails himself as Mr Fox11 used, of the
sentimentalities & superstitions about purity, though asserting along
with it all the right principles. But C. says that the Fourrierists are
the only Socialists who are not orthodox about marriage—he forgets the
Owenites,12 but I fear it is true of all the known Communist leaders in
France—he says it specially of Buchez,13 Cabet,14 & what surprises one
in Sand’s15 “guide, philosopher & friend” of Leroux.16 This strengthens
one exceedingly in one’s wish to prôner the Fourrierists besides that
their scheme of association seems to me much nearer to being practicable
at present than Communism.—Your letter was very delightful—it was so
very pleasant to know that you were still better as to general health
than I knew before, & that the lameness also improves though slowly. I
am very glad I did right about Herbert17—his conduct on Xmas day & his
not writing even to say that he is going to America seem like
ostentation of heartlessness & are only as you say to be explained by
his being a very great fool (at present) & therefore influenced by some
miserably petty vanities & irritabilities. Their not sending George’s18
letter directly is very strange. The pamphlet19 has gone to Hickson—I
had thought of sending one of the separate copies to L. Blanc.20 Whom
else should it go to? To all the members of the Prov. Gov. I think, & as
it will not be published till April I had better take the copies to
Paris with me & send them when there as it saves so much uncertainty &
delay. I did see that villainous thing in the Times21 & noticed that the
American had used those words.

I despatched yesterday to the dear one an attempt at a revision of the
objectionable passages.2 I saw on consideration that the objection to
Communism on the ground of its making life a kind of dead level might
admit of being weakened (though I think it never could be taken away)
consistently with the principle of Communism, though the Communistic
plans now before the public could not do it. The statement of objections
was moreover too vague & general. I have made it more explicit as well
as more moderate; you will judge whether it is now sufficiently either
one or the other; & altogether whether any objection can be maintained
to Communism, except the amount of objection which, in the new matter I
have introduced, is made to the present applicability of Fourierism.3 I
think there can—& that the objections as now stated to Communism are
valid: but if you do not think so, I certainly will not print it, even
if there were no other reason than the certainty I feel that I never
should long continue of an opinion different from yours on a subject
which you have fully considered. I am going on revising the book: not
altering much, but in one of the purely political economy parts which
occurs near the beginning, viz. the discussion as to whether buying
goods made by labour gives the same employment to labour as hiring the
labourers themselves, I have added two or three pages of new explanation
& illustration which I think make the case much clearer.4—It is
certainly an unlucky coincidence that the winter which you have gone
away from should be so very mild a one here: on Sunday I found the
cottage gardens &c. as far advanced as they often are only in the middle
of April; mezereons, hepaticas, the white arabis, pyrus japonica &c. in
the fullest flower, the snow ball plant very much in leaf, even
periwinkles & red anemones fully out: daffodils I saw only in bud. If it
is not checked it will be I think an even earlier spring than the very
early one two or three years ago. I shall be able to benefit by Edition:
current; Page: [12] it more than I expected in the way of country walks
on Sundays although the dimness of sight, slight as it is, interferes
not a little with the enjoyment of distant scenery—as I found in that
beautiful Windsor Park last Sunday. If it is very fine I think I shall
go some Sunday & wander about Combe—it is so full of association with
all I wish for & care for. As I have taken care to let my ailments be
generally known at the I[ndia] H[ouse] I have no doubt it will be easy
to get a two or three months holiday in spring if we like: this indeed
if I return quite well would make any holiday in the after part of the
year impracticable, but need not prevent me from taking two or three
days at a time occasionally during a séjour at Ryde or any other place &
thus making it a partial holiday there—Unless, which I do not expect, a
long holiday soon should be necessary for health, the question ought to
depend entirely on what would best suit you—which is quite sure to be
most desirable for me—I am in hopes that parties in France are taking a
more republican turn than they seemed likely to do—if Napoleon Bonaparte
coalesces with Lamartine’s party for election purposes there will be a
much larger body of sincere republicans in the new assembly than was
expected.5 The Roman republic & the Tuscan Provisional Govt I am afraid
will end in nothing but a restoration by Austria & a putting down of the
popular party throughout Italy.6 I was sorry to see in the feuilleton of
the National7 a very bad article on women in the form of a review of a
book by the M. Légouvé8 who was so praised in La Voix des Femmes.9 The
badness consisted chiefly in laying down the doctrine very positively
that women always are & must always be what men make them—just the false
assumption on which the whole of the present bad constitution of the
relation rests. I am convinced however that there are only two things
which tend at all to shake this nonsensical prejudice: a better
psychology & theory of human nature, for the few; & for the Edition:
current; Page: [13] many, more & greater proofs by example of what women
can do. I do not think anything that could be written would do nearly so
much good on that subject the most important of all, as the finishing
your pamphlet—or little book rather, for it should be that.10 I do hope
you are going on with it—gone on with & finished & published it must be,
& next season too.—Do you notice that Russell in bringing forward his
Jew Bill,11 although he is actually abolishing the old oaths & framing
new, still has the meanness to reinsert the words “on the true faith of
a Christian” for all persons except Jews, & justifies it by saying that
the Constitution ought not avowedly to admit unbelievers into
Parliament.—I have seen very little of the Chairman & Dep. Chairman12
lately—as to avoid the long staircase I have communicated with them
chiefly through others but now being released from restraint I shall
take an early opportunity of speaking to Galloway about Haji.13 I have
seen nothing more of Haji any more than of Herbert.14 [torn page]

My dear Hickson

I attach importance to most of the notes,2 since when I am charging
Brougham with misrepresentation of what Lamartine said,3 it will not do
to Edition: current; Page: [14] bid the reader trust to my
translations—and the passages from Tocqueville4 being cited as evidence
to matters of fact, ought to be given in the original. You however must
judge what is best for your review. You kindly offered me some separate
copies—I should not desire more than 50, but in these I would like to
have the notes preserved and it would not be necessary for that purpose
to set them up in smaller type. If the types are redistributed I would
willingly pay the expense of recomposing. I cannot imagine how the
printer could commit the stupid blunder of putting those notes with the
text. As a heading,5 “The Revolution of February and its assailants”
would do. In the separate copies I should like to have a title page,
which might run thus: “A Vindication of the French Revolution of 1848 in
reply to Lord Brougham and others.”

Yours ever,

What a nuisance it is having anything to do with printers—Though I had
no reason to be particularly pleased with Harrison,2 I was alarmed at
finding that Parker3 had gone to another, & accordingly, though the
general type of the first edition is exactly copied, yet a thing so
important as the type of the headings at the top of the page cannot be
got right—you know what difficulty we had before—& now the headings, &
everything else which is in that type, they first gave much too close &
then much too wide, & say they have not got the exact thing, unless they
have the types cast on purpose. Both the things they have produced seem
to me detestable & the worst is that as Parker is sole owner of this
edition I suppose I have no voice in the matter at all except as a point
of courtesy. I shall see Parker today & tell him that I should have
Edition: current; Page: [15] much preferred waiting till another season
rather than having either of these types—but I suppose it is too late
now to do any good—& perhaps Parker dragged out the time in useless
delays before, on purpose that all troublesome changes might be avoided
by hurry now. It is as disagreeable as a thing of the sort can possibly
be—because it is necessary that something should be decided immediately
without waiting for the decision of my only guide & oracle. If the
effect should be to make the book an unpleasant object to the only eyes
I wish it to please, how excessively I shall regret not having put off
the edition till next season. I have had the proof of the pamphlet,4 all
but the last few pages. There seems very little remaining in it that
could be further softened without taking the sting out entirely—which
would be a pity. I am rather against giving away any copies, at least
for the present, in England—except to Louis Blanc to whom I suppose I
should acknowledge authorship. He has not come near me—I see he is
writing in sundry Communist papers of which there are now several in
London.5 As a heading in the review I have thought of “The Revolution of
February & its assailants”—it does not seem advisable to put Brougham’s
name at the top of the page—& “the Revolution of February” or anything
of that kind itself would be tame, & excite no attention. There is no
fresh news from George6 nor any incident of any kind except that Mr Fox
has sent me (without any letter) four volumes of his lectures to the
working classes,7 the last volume of which (printed this year) has a
preface in which he recommends to the working classes to study Polit.
Economy8 telling them that they will see by “the ablest book yet
produced on this subject” that it is not a thing against them but for
them—with some other expressions of compliment he quotes two passages,
one of them the strongest there is in the book about independence of
women,9 & tells them in another place though rather by inference than
directly that women ought to have the suffrage.10 He speaks in this
preface of “failing health” & as if he did not expect either to write or
speak in public much more: this may mean little, or very much. I feel
now as if the natural thing, the thing to be expected, was to hear of
every one’s death—as if we should outlive all we have cared for, & yet
die early.

Did you notice that most bête & vulgar say by Emerson in a lecture at
Boston, about the English? It is hardly possible to be more stupidly
wrong—& Edition: current; Page: [16] what sort of people can he have
been among when here?11 The Austrian octroyé federal constitution12
seems as bad as anything pretending to be a constitution at all now
dares to be—the only significant circumstance in it on the side of
democracy being that there is no House of Lords nor any mention of
nobility or hereditary rank. Here the sort of newspaper discussion which
had begun about Sterling’s13 infidelity seems to have merged in a
greater scandal about a book by Froude,14 a brother of the Froude who
was the originator of Puseyism15—This book was reviewed in the last
Spectator16 I sent to you & that review was the first I had heard & is
all I have seen of the book—but the Herald & Standard17 are abusing the
man in the tone of Dominican Inquisitors on account of the strong
declarations against the inspiration of the Bible which he puts into the
mouth of one of his characters, obviously as they say thinking the same
himself—It appears the Council of University College had been asked to
select a schoolmaster for Hobart Town & had chosen Froude from among a
great many candidates & probably some rival defeated candidate has
raised this stir.18 It all, I think, does good, but one ought to see
occasionally the things that are written on Edition: current; Page: [17]
such matters, in order not to forget the intensity of the vulgar
bigotry, or affection of it, that is still thought to be the thing for
the Christian readers of newspapers in this precious country. The Times
is quite gentlemanlike in comparison with those other papers when they
get on the ground of imputed infidelity or anything approaching to it. I
suppose they overshoot their mark, but they would scruple nothing in any
such case.

[⅔ of folio 1r cut away] the old way, or [rest of line cut away] has the
advantage of taking [rest of line cut away] Toulouse, but I suspect the
means of conveyance by it are much slower & more precarious, till we
reach Bourges or Châteauroux where we join the railway. I think from
what has been in the papers that the whole or nearly the whole of the [⅔
of page cut away as above].

The bargain with Parker2 is a good one & that it is so is entirely your
doing—all the difference between it & the last being wholly your work,
as well as all the best of the book itself so that you have a redoubled
title to your joint ownership of it. While I am on the subject I will
say that the difficulty with the printer is surmounted3—both he & Parker
were disposed to be accommodating & he was to have the very same type
from the very same foundry today—in the meantime there has been no time
lost, as they have been printing very fast without the headings, & will
I have no doubt keep their engagement as to time. You do not say
anything this time about the bit of the P[olitical] E[conomy]—I hope you
did not send it during the week, as if so it has miscarried—at the rate
they are printing, both volumes at once, they will soon want it.

I was wrong to express myself that way about the Athenians,4 because
without due explanations it would not be rightly understood. I am always
apt Edition: current; Page: [18] to get enthusiastic about those who do
great things for progress & are immensely ahead of everybody else in
their age—especially when like the Athenians it has been the fashion to
run them down for what was best in them—& I am not always sufficiently
careful to explain that the praise is relative to the then state & not
the now state of knowledge & of what ought to be improved feeling. I do
think, however even without those allowances, that an average Athenian
was a far finer specimen of humanity on the whole than an average
Englishman—but then unless one says how low one estimates the latter,
one gives a false notion of one’s estimate of the former. You are not
quite right about the philosophers, for Plato did condemn those
“barbarisms”.

I regret much that I have not put in anything about Palmerston into that
pamphlet5—I am almost tempted to write an express article in the Westr
in order to make him the amende. As you suggested I wrote an article on
Russell’s piece of meanness in the Jew Bill6 & have sent it to Crowe7
from whom I have not yet any answer—there has been no time hitherto fit
for its publication—the time will be when the subject is about to come
on again in Parlt. But I fear the article, even as “from a
correspondent” will be too strong meat for the Daily News, as it
declares without mincing the matter, that infidels are perfectly proper
persons to be in parliament. I like the article myself. I have carefully
avoided anything disrespectful to Russell personally, or any of the
marks, known to me, by which my writing can be recognized.

If I meet Fleming8 again or am again assaulted on any similar point I
will reply in the sort of way you recommend—I dare say the meeting with
F. was accidental as it was just at the door of Somerset House where he
is assistant secretary to the Poor Law Board & just at the time when he
would probably be coming out. Ever since I have kept the opposite side.

The Pol. Ec. packet came on Monday for which a thousand thanks. I have
followed to the letter every recommendation. The sentence which you
objected Edition: current; Page: [19] to in toto of course has come
quite out.2 In explanation however of what I meant by it—I was not
thinking of any mysterious change in human nature—but chiefly of
this—that the best people now are necessarily so much cut off from
sympathy with the multitudes that I should think they must have
difficulty in judging how they would be affected by such an immense
change in their whole circumstances as would be caused by having
multitudes whom they could sympathize with—or in knowing how far the
social feelings might then supply the place of that large share of
solitariness & individuality which they cannot now dispense with. I
meant one thing more, viz. that as, hereafter, the more obvious &
coarser obstacles & objections to the community system will have ceased
or greatly diminished, those which are less obvious & coarse will then
step forward into an importance & require an attention which does not
now practically belong to them & that we can hardly tell without trial
what the result of that experience will be. I do not say that you cannot
realize and judge of these things—but if you, & perhaps Shelley & one or
two others in a generation can, I am convinced that to do so requires
both great genius & great experience & I think it quite fair to say to
common readers that the present race of mankind (speaking of them
collectively) are not competent to it. I cannot persuade myself that you
do not greatly overrate the ease of making people unselfish. Granting
that in “ten years” the children of a community might by teaching be
made “perfect” it seems to me that to do so there must be perfect people
to teach them. You say “if there were a desire on the part of the
cleverer people to make them perfect it would be easy”—but how to
produce that desire in the cleverer people? I must say I think that if
we had absolute power tomorrow, though we could do much to improve
people by good laws, & could even give them a very much better education
than they have ever had yet, still, for effecting in our lives anything
like what we aim at, all our plans would fail from the impossibility of
finding fit instruments. To make people really good for much it is so
necessary not merely to give them good intentions & conscientiousness
but to unseal their eyes—to prevent self flattery, vanity, irritability
& all that family of vices from warping their moral judgments as those
of the very cleverest people are almost always warped now. But we shall
have all these questions out together & they will all require to be
entered into to a certain depth, at least, in the new book3 which I am
so glad you look forward to as I do with so much interest.—As for
news—did you see in the Times Mrs Buller’s death? I Edition: current;
Page: [20] suspect it was there the very day I wrote last. I have heard
nothing of the manner or occasion of it, & had not supposed from
anything I had heard before, that there was any likelihood of it. So
that volume is closed now, completely.4 I called the other day at
Charles Fox’s5 shop to ask the meaning of Mr Fox’s illness & C.F. said
he has constant pains in his side which are either heart disease or
merely nervous but which are made much worse by public speaking or any
other excitement & that that is the reason he so seldom speaks in the
H[ouse] of C[ommons]. It is probably mere nervous pain therefore, & not
dangerous, but it shews him to be out of health. There were letters from
George6 yesterday of three weeks later date: his report is that he is
neither worse nor better. He thinks that he coughs about six or seven
times an hour through the 24 hours. He still writes as not at all out of
spirits—one expression he uses is that he wants nothing to make him
happy but to be able to go up into the mountains, & to have a better
prospect of the future—I think he means a better avenir in case he
ultimately recovers—but he seems persuaded that his disease is seldom
cured or stopped. I shall write to encourage him, for I am convinced it
is often stopped though hardly ever cured, & I do not yet despair of his
case.

Crowe’s answer was “I shall be but too happy to print the article.7 The
Jews Bill is put off till after Easter, but if you will allow me I will
insert it immediately.” There is nothing like kicking people of the
D[aily] N[ews] sort it appears. I answered telling him if he thought it
would be of as much use now as about the time when the bill comes on by
all means to print it now. It has not yet made its appearance. The
printing of the 2d edit.8 goes on satisfactorily in all respects. Last
Sunday I went by railway to Watford & walked from there to town, indeed
more, for the direct road being by Stanmore I turned off before getting
there, to Harrow, thus lengthening the walk 3 or 4 miles. I think I must
have walked 20 miles, & almost all of it at a stretch, with occasional
short resting on a stile. I confess however that the miles between
Harrow & London were excessively long, but I felt no kind of
inconvenience the next day or since from the walk. The lameness is now
no obstacle at all—the only obstacle is general weakness, as compared
with my state when in perfect health. The sight remains the same.9 I
look forward to Saturday with immense pleasure because there is always a
letter—adieu with every good wish.

[9/10 of first folio cut away] short too—as a [rest of line cut away]
surprised to hear of [rest of line cut away] been some, very often for
the last fortnight—but it has never lain. Today it is a sunny [9/10 of
page cut away as above] The alteration I had made in that sentence of
the P[olitical] E[conomy] was instead of “placard their intemperance” to
say “placard their enormous families”—it does not read so well, but I
think it may do, especially as the previous sentence contains the words
“this sort of incontinence”—but your two sentences are so very good that
as that sheet is not yet printed, get them in I must & will.2—Are you
not amused with Peel about Ireland? He sneers down the waste lands
plan,3 two years ago, which the timid ministers, timid because without
talent, give up at a single sarcasm from him, & now he has enfanté a
scheme containing that & much more than was then proposed—& the Times
supports him4 & Ireland praises him. I am extremely glad he has done
it—I can see that it is working as nothing else has yet worked to break
down the superstition about property—& it is the only thing happening in
England which promises a step forward—a thing which one may well welcome
when things are going so badly for the popular cause in Europe—not that
I am discouraged by this—progress of the right kind seems to me quite
safe now that Socialism has become inextinguishable. I heartily wish
Proudhon dead however—there are few men whose state of mind, taken as a
whole, inspires me with so much aversion, & all his influence seems to
me mischievous except as a potent dissolvent which is good so far, but
every single thing which he would substitute seems to me the worst
possible in practice & mostly in principle. I have been reading another
volume of Considérant5 lately published—he has got into the details of
Fourierism, with many large extracts from Fourier himself. It was
perhaps necessary to enter into details in order to make the thing look
practicable, but many of the details are, & all appear, passablement
ridicules. As to their system, & Edition: current; Page: [22] general
mode of thought there is a great question at the root of it which must
be settled before one can get a step further. Admitting the omnipotence
of education, is not the very pivot & turning point of that education a
moral sense—a feeling of duty, or conscience, or principle, or whatever
name one gives it—a feeling that one ought to do, & to wish for, what is
for the greatest good of all concerned. Now Fourier, & all his
followers, leave this out entirely, & rely wholly on such an arrangement
of social circumstances as without any inculcation of duty or of
“ought,” will make every one, by the spontaneous action of the passions,
intensely zealous for all the interests of the whole. Nobody is ever to
be made to do anything but act just as they like, but it is calculated
that they will always, in a phalanstere, like what is best. This of
course leads to the freest notions about personal relations of all
sorts, but is it, in other respects, a foundation on which people would
be able to live & act together. Owen keeps in generals & only says that
education can make everybody perfect, but the Fourierists attempt to
shew how, & exclude, as it seems to me, one of the most indispensable
ingredients.

6What a bathos to turn from these free speculations to pinched &
methodistical England. It is worth while reading the articles in
newspapers about Froude & Sterling7 to have an adequate idea what
England is. The newspaper talk on the subject having the irresistible
attraction of personality still continues, & I have within this week
read in shop windows leading articles of two weekly newspapers, the
Church & State Gazette8 & the English Churchman,9 keeping it up. They
have found the splendid mare’s nest of the “Sterling Club”.10 I remember
the foundation of the said club by Sterling himself, very many years
before his death—soon after he began to live permanently out of London.
Though called a club it had neither subscription nor organization, but
consisted in an agreement of some 12 or 20 acquaintances of Sterling,
the majority resident University people, that there should be one day in
a month when if any of them liked to dine at a place in Lincoln’s Inn
Fields he would have a chance of finding some of the others. I let them
put me down as one, & went there, I think three times, with Sterling
himself & at his request, in order to pass an evening in his company—the
last time being, I believe, in 1838. A few weeks ago I was reminded of
the existence of the thing by receiving a printed list of members, in
which I was put down Edition: current; Page: [23] with many others as
honorary—it has greatly increased in numbers, is composed (in more than
one half) of clergymen including two bishops, Thirlwall11 &
Wilberforce,12 & I suppose it has organized itself with a regular
subscription, as it has removed to the Freemason’s & has begun sending
circulars previous to each dinner. One of these lists fell into the
hands of the “Record”13 newspaper & combining this with Hare’s Life of
Sterling it charges Hare, Maurice,14 Trench,15 these bishops, &
innumerable others with founding a society to honour & commemorate an
infidel, & joining for that purpose with persons strongly suspected of
being no better than infidels themselves, such as Carlyle & me. It is
very amusing that those people who take such care to guard their
orthodoxy get nothing by it but to be more bitterly attacked. However it
shews what I did not suppose, that it required some courage in a church
dignitary to write about a heretic even in the guarded way that Hare
did.—

Yesterday Nichol16 called on me—whom I had not seen since 1840—he is in
town for some days or probably weeks & is about to publish a book on
America where he has been travelling.17 As he is a walking man I am
going to have a country walk with him tomorrow—my other Sunday walks
have been alone. I have always thought him a man of whom something might
be made if one could see enough of him—I shall perhaps be able to judge
now if my opinion was right, but at all events his book will shew. He
has this in his favour at least which is the grand distinction now that
he is intensely forward-looking—not at all conservative in feeling but
willing to be very destructive & now adieu with every possible wish.

My dear Hickson—

I send you Mr Lombe’s2 letter as you desire. Who can he be that pays for
articles at £100 each & talks so confidently of sending one or two
members to Parliament? I, at least, can take no part in what he
proposes, for I do not agree with him. I do not think the coast
blockade3 so ineffectual as it is represented, & at all events, to
abandon it would be understood throughout the world as the abandonment
of our anti-slavery policy & by its moral effect would I believe
increase the amount of slavery tenfold. I do not mean that it should be
persevered in for ever, but I would not give it up until something more
effectual for the purpose is actually in operation.—I hope you are in
better health & that your excursion to Paris will set you up. My ramble4
has done me good but has not cured my principal ailment.5

TO WILLIAM GEORGE WARD1

[
Spring of 1849

]

Dear Sir—

You have given me six months2 to answer all your questions. I think you
ought to allow me six volumes too; for if the questions occupy so many
pages, what must the answers? I could give, no doubt, some sort of
replies to most of your queries in a few sentences, but they would not
be such as could be satisfactory either to you or to myself. However
your letter is a sort of challenge which I am unwilling to refuse,
though aware that what I say will give scarcely the faintest idea of how
much there is to say & though I do not undertake to carry on the
discussion any further. If I did, each answer would suggest further
questions & these would require longer answers, till I would be led into
writing a treatise on each point—which though if I live I may probably
do—at any rate, I had rather defer until I can do it thoroughly & in a
shape for permanent use.

1st. Your explanations do not at all clear up, to my apprehension, what
I think the inconsistency of blending high moral praise with the
strongest language of moral reprobation.3 You say that certain states of
mind are sinful in the greatest degree, yet that for those states the
individual may possibly be not at all responsible. I can understand that
persons may hold false & pernicious opinions conscientiously & may have
defects or peculiarities of character which both in themselves and in
their consequences are extremely undesirable, yet to which their own
wishes or voluntary conduct having in no way contributed, they are not
morally accountable for them. But to call anything a sin & yet say that
the sinner is not accountable for it seems to me if the word sin means
anything, a direct contradiction. It is you who appear to be chargeable
with what my opinions are usually charged with, viz. confounding the
distinction between moral badness & mere aberration in a person or thing
from the ideal perfection of the kind of being it belongs to. Edition:
current; Page: [26] I recognise two kinds of imperfections: those which
come independently of our will & which our will could not prevent, & for
these we are not accountable; & those which our will has either
positively or negatively assisted in producing & for which we are
accountable. The former may be very hurtful to ourselves & offensive to
others but in us they are not morally culpable. The latter are. You ride
over this (as it seems to me) perfectly definite distinction by the
ambiguous word sin, under which a third class of defects of character
finds entrance which is supposed to unite both attributes—to be culpable
& ultra-culpable although the person thus morally guilty cannot help it.
This seems to me to exemplify the unmeaningness of the word sin which if
it is anything other than the theological synonym of “morally wrong” is
a name for something which I do not admit to exist.

2d. On the subject out of which this discussion grew, population,
marriage, &c.4 we differ so utterly that there seems not even a chance
of our doing ourselves or each other any good by discussing it. Our
ideas of moral obligation on the subject are completely incompatible,
the repugnancy goes down to the very root of the subject & I entertain
quite as uncomplimentary an opinion of your mode of regarding these
questions as you can possibly do of mine. Two sentences will give some
little notion of the wideness of our divergence. You think that the
legality or illegality of an act makes a difference (not in its being
right or wrong, socially speaking—but) in its purity or impurity—& you
think that a man can without forfeiting his title to respect, live in
the habitual practice of that which he feels to be degrading to him. I,
on the contrary, cannot conceive anything more gross & grovelling than
the conceptions involved in the first supposition & the conduct
described in the second. They appear to me the extreme of animalism &
sensuality in the fullest sense of the bad meaning of those terms.

I will say nothing more on this subject except to correct a mistake you
have made about my opinions on population. I do not know where you find
that on my shewing the evils of over-population are in some distant
future. On the contrary, I hold with Malthus that they are, & have been
throughout history, almost everywhere present, & often in great
intensity.

3d. You ask what are the natural instincts that civilisation has
strikingly & memorably conquered. I answer, nearly all. E.g. the
instinct of taking a thing which we very much wish for, wherever we find
it—food, for instance, when we are hungry. The instinct of knocking down
a person who offends us if we are the strongest. As a rather different
example take the eminently artificial virtue of cleanliness—think what
savages are, & what violence must be done to the natural man to produce
the feelings which civilised people Edition: current; Page: [27] have on
this point—take again all the delicacies respecting bodily physicalities
which savages have not a vestige of but which in the artificialised
human being often equal in intensity any human feelings, natural or
artificial.

4th. As to the opinion expressed in the Logic,5 that miracles are
evidence of a revelation only to those who already believe in a God or
at least in supernatural beings. What I meant is this. We can never know
that what is presented to us as a miracle, is so. The proof can only be
negative, viz. that we do not know any mode in which the thing can have
been produced by natural means; & what is this worth when we are so
ignorant of nature? Two years ago a man who by passing a handkerchief
across a person’s face could plunge him into a sort of extasy during
which a limb could be cut off without pain would have given apparent
evidence of miraculous powers equal to any saint in the calendar. You
ask, but what if the man himself, being morally trustworthy, affirms
that it is a miracle? I answer, this would in many cases convince me
that he himself believed it to be one; but that would weigh for
absolutely nothing with me, as it is the easiest & commonest fact in the
world, especially in an unscientific state of the human mind, that
people should sincerely ascribe any peculiar & remarkable power in
themselves to divine gift, & any unexpected prompting of their own minds
to a divine communication. If the spectator did not previously believe
in supernatural powers an apparent miracle will never give him, I
conceive, any reason for believing in them, while he is aware that there
are natural powers unknown to him; but if he does already believe in
supernatural powers he has the choice between two agencies both of which
he feels assured really exist & he therefore may & ought to consider
which of the two is the most probable in the individual instance.

Next as to Xtianity. You need not have supposed any inclination in me to
speak with irreverence of J[esus] C[hrist]. He is one of the very few
historical characters for whom I have a real & high respect. But there
is not, to me, the smallest proof of his having ever said that he worked
miracles—nor if he did, should I feel obliged either to believe the fact
or to disbelieve his veracity. Respecting St Paul I have a very
different feeling. I hold him to have been the first great corrupter of
Xtianity. He never saw Christ, never was under his personal influence,
hardly ever alludes to any of his deeds or sayings, seems to have kept
aloof from all who had known him & in short, made up a religion which is
Paulism but not, me judice, Xtianity. Even St Paul however, though I
would by no means answer for his sincerity, never that I know of speaks
of any particular miracle as having been wrought by him—he only speaks
generally of signs & wonders which may mean anything. The author of the
“Acts” does speak of particular miracles, & those like the miracles of
the Gospel I no more believe than I do the miraculous cure mentioned by
Edition: current; Page: [28] Tacitus as wrought by Vespasian.6 I regard
them simply as part of the halo which popular enthusiasm throws round
its heroes. The argument of the Horae Paulinae7 scarcely aims at proving
more than that St Paul really wrote the epistles ascribed to him, which
in respect to all but one or two of them, no competent enquirer, I
believe, seriously doubts (the case is very different from that of the
Gospels), & that the Acts are in part an authentic record of St. Paul’s
life, which I see no reason to disbelieve, no more than that Livy is in
part a true history of Rome & Herodotus of the countries of which he
treats. Since I am on the subject I will add that I cannot conceive how,
except from deeprooted impressions of education, any reasonable person
can attach value to any attestations of a miracle in an age when
everybody was ready to believe miracles the moment they were attested, &
even enemies instead of denying the facts, ascribed them to diabolical
agency. I would say to such a person, only read any book which gives a
really living picture of, let us say, the Oriental mind of the present
day. You there see hundreds of millions of people to whose habits of
thought supernatural agency is of such everyday familiarity that if you
tell them any strange fact & say it is miraculous, they believe you at
once, but if you give them a physical explanation of it, they think you
a juggler & an imposter. Add to this that until long after the time
Xtianity began you hardly find a trace even in the best minds of any
regard for abstract veracity—any feeling which should prevent a teacher
from deceiving the people for their good. Plato, the highest expression
probably of the ethical philosophy of the ancient world & the elevated
nature of whose purposes it is impossible to doubt, thought it the duty
of legislators to pretend a supernatural origin for their precepts,8 as
all very early legislators seem to have done.

These are I think the more important topics of your letter. As to the
condition of the labouring people as compared with former times, I
incline to think them worse off as to quantity tho’ not quality of food
than three centuries ago, and better off as to clothing & lodging—but
there is a sad dearth of facts that can be relied on. You speak of
Macaulay9 and D’Israeli10 Edition: current; Page: [29] as
authorities—anything that Macaulay says, is not matter of observation
but of inference & argument of which one must judge for oneself. As for
D’Israeli & his Sibyl [sic], I cannot imagine its being received as
testimony, or supposed to be anything but a commonplace story.

I am afraid I cannot be of any use to you in recommending treatises on
astronomy as it is many years since I read any of the more deeply
mathematical sort. The most recent that I have read is that of Biot,11
which is probably by this time superseded. I have never read Laplace’s
Mécanique Céleste,12 but have understood that it is the most obscure, &
by no means the best, of the treatises on the subject. Most probably
Pontécoulant13 will answer your purpose. Nobody I believe ever hazarded
a conjecture when the supposed condensation of the sun’s atmosphere
began nor whether it is indefinitely progressive or forms part of a
cycle including periods of expansion as well as of contraction. I
believe it is thought, though I know not on what grounds, that the
throwing off of new planets has ceased. It is, I believe, mathematically
demonstrable that the supposed changes could not alter the centre of
gravity of the solar system & therefore (as it cannot alter the total
mass of matter) would make no difference in the orbits of the planets or
in any of the other effects of gravitation.

The opinion that all axioms are founded on the evidence of experience,
rests to my own mind on the most complete proof but I always knew it
would be very difficult to bring home that evidence to those trained in
a different school of psychology from mine. Accordingly I have failed to
make you see (I do not mean admit) the main & characteristic points of
my doctrine on the subject, viz. that our not being able to conceive a
thing is no evidence of the thing’s being in itself impossible. You
understand me correctly to say that the absence of any law of causation
in some distant star, not only is, for anything we know, perfectly
possible but is even conceivable—but you ask, is it conceivable that in
such a star two straight lines may inclose a space? I say, certainly it
is not conceivable, but that does not prove to me that the thing is
impossible, since the limitation may be in our faculties, & in the
all-pervadingness, to us, of a contrary experience. Again, “the
possibility of proving geometrical first principles by merely mental
experimentation”14 seems to me to arise from previous experience that in
this particular department what is true of our mental images is true
also of their originals, which I illustrated in the Logic by the case of
a daguerreotype.15

Edition: current; Page: [30]
I agree with you that ratiocinative logic may usefully be taught
separately from inductive & belongs indeed to an earlier stage in mental
instruction.

It is so long since I read Butler16 & I have so little faith in opinions
the grounds of which we are not constantly revising, that I will not
venture to express an opinion of him. I know that my father thought the
argument of the “Analogy” conclusive against deists with whom alone
Butler professes to argue & I have heard my father say that it kept him
for some time a believer in Xtianity. I was not prepared by what I had
heard from him for so contemptuous an opinion as is indicated in some
passages of the “Fragment”17 though he never can have thought highly of
Butler except by comparison with other writers of the same general
tendency in opinion.

I am convinced that competent judges who have sufficient experience of
children will not agree in the opinion you express that they have a
natural idea of right or duty. I am satisfied that all such ideas in
children are the result of inculcation & that were it not for
inculcation they would not exist at all except probably in a few persons
of pre-eminent genius & feeling.

I have followed your example in expressing my meaning without polite
circumlocutions, as I believe you really wish that I should—& any
appearance of egotism or dogmatism in what I have said, you will, I
hope, not attribute to my thinking an opinion important because it is
mine, but will remember that what you asked me to do was to tell you as
a matter of fact, what my opinions are, & that too on subjects on which
they are strong, & have been much & long considered. I am dear Sir, very
truly yours

28th May 1849

My dear Chapman

You must have been expecting to hear from me long before this, on the
Edition: current; Page: [31] subject of your article2 for the Edinburgh
& indeed I have delayed writing much too long, although the reason of
the delay was the hope of being able to write something more certain
about the article than I am even yet able to do. I must mention to you
in the first place that I am not on terms of direct communication with
the Edinburgh since the death of Napier3 & the accession of the present
editor Empson.4 I was therefore obliged to have recourse to an indirect
channel & I thought Buller5 the best as it enabled me at the same time
to say a word in the hope of forwarding your views with respect to V[an]
D[iemen’s] L[and]. But when I called at Buller’s with the article he was
at Paris & when he returned he fell ill & you know the catastrophe. As
soon as I could get back the article from among his papers I applied to
Senior6 who sent it to Empson; I having first, under the power you gave
me, made the few alterations & omissions which seemed to me desirable.
Empson wrote to Senior saying that the article was interesting & he
should like to insert it, but could not do so before the July number &
then must make some alterations & suppressions; this I ventured, in your
name, to express assent to. Two or three weeks ago, however, (I being at
the time out of town) Empson returned the article to Senior saying that
he had tried to alter the article as he had proposed doing, but had not
been able to satisfy himself, & added a question, Would Senior’s unknown
friend (meaning me, for I had not authorized S. to mention me in
connexion with the article) try to set the article in order for the
October number. This is the state which the thing is now in. I shall try
to do what he says, but I am so little aware of what his objections are
to the article as it stands, that it is very probable I may not be able
to remove them. When I am able to tell you more I will. As to your
claims to promotion,7 I can contribute nothing but good wishes—my
interest Edition: current; Page: [32] with Lord Grey8 or any other
members of the government is less than none, it is negative, & is never
likely to be otherwise.—Thanks for your full particulars about New
Zealand affairs in all departments & for your last letter about the
earthquake.9 I hope it will not turn out that such serious natural
convulsions are to be of common occurrence—as it is I fear even what you
have had will be likely to check the recourse of capital & even of
labour to the colony. In Europe we are as thickly as ever in the midst
of another sort of convulsions—in which the despots10 for the present
appear to be getting the best of it & will probably succeed by the aid
of Russian troops in putting down democracy for a time everywhere but in
France,—the democratic spirit in Germany11 & even in Italy,12 seems
quite too strong to be put down & it is sure to resume its ascendancy
even but it is terrible to think of a noble people like the Hungarians
being cut to pieces13 & their country made another Poland of.14 The
whole problem of modern society however will be worked out, as I have
long thought it would, in France & nowhere else. I do not know if I have
written to you or not since the extraordinary election of Louis
Bonaparte as President of the Republic by six or seven millions of votes
against a million & a half,15 an election the more remarkable as the
million & a half included not only all the intelligence of France but
most of what is called the property, a large proportion both of the
bourgeoisie & of the grands propriétaires having voted for Cavaignac.16
The election was carried by the vast mass of the peasantry, & it is one
of the most striking instances in history of the power of a name—though
no doubt dislike of the republic helped the effect, the peasantry being
too ignorant to care much about forms of government & being irritated by
the temporary increase of taxation which the revolution17 rendered
necessary & terrified by the anti-property doctrines of Edition:
current; Page: [33] Proudhon & the Socialists—I may say of Proudhon
only, for the Socialists, even the Communists, do not propose to take
away any property from any one, any more than Owen does. The result is
that France having had the rare good fortune of finding two men in
succession of perfectly upright intentions, enlightened principles &
good sense, Lamartine & Cavaignac, has chosen to reject both & be
governed by a stupid, ignorant adventurer who has thrown himself
entirely into the hands of the reactionary party,18 &, but that he is
too great a fool, would have some chance by these means of making
himself emperor.19 But the elections just ended have much disappointed
that party, for though they will have a majority20 in the new assembly,
the number of the Montagne or red republican party (who are now all
socialists) have increased fourfold, while the moderate republican party
also musters a considerable number, though many of its chiefs have been
turned out. There will probably be no outbreak like that of June21
(unless to repel some attempt at a coup d’état) for the democrats & even
the socialists will now think they have a better chance of gaining their
objects by the peaceable influence of discussion on the minds of the
electors—but what turn things will take it is hard to say, the French
people being divided into two violent parties, the furious friends of
“order” & the Socialists, who have generally very wild & silly notions &
little that one can sympathize with except the spirit & feelings which
actuate them. The party who attempt to mediate between these two
extremes as the Provisional Government strove to do, is weak, & is
disliked by both parties, though there are some signs that all sections
of republicans intend to pull together now that they are all in
opposition. The chance for France & Europe entirely depends now on the
respite which has been obtained & on the possibility of the maturing by
this middle party, of rational principles on which to construct an order
of society which, retaining the institution of private property (but
facilitating all possible experiments for dispensing with it by means of
association) shall studiously hurl all inequalities out necessarily
inherent in that institution. As an example I may mention the grand idea
of the Provisional Government, that of making all education, even
professional, gratuitous,22 which as they proposed it, is liable to the
grave objection of throwing all education virtually into the hands of
the government, but means might I think be found to purge the scheme of
this most serious fault. A great source of hope for France lies in the
fact that the most Edition: current; Page: [34] powerful & active
section of the Socialists are the Fourierists headed by Considérant, who
are much the most sensible & enlightened both in the destructive, & in
the constructive parts of their system, & are eminently pacific. On the
other hand there is the great danger of having a firebrand like
Proudhon, the most mischievous man in Europe, & who has nothing whatever
of all that I like & respect in the Socialists to whom he in no way
belongs.—We certainly live in a most interesting period of history. As
for England, it is dead, vapid, left quite behind by all the questions
now rising. From the Dukes to the Chartists, including all intermediate
stages, people have neither heads nor hearts, & yet they all hug
themselves & think they are the only people who are good for anything, &
all their public men, even Roebuck,23 have the sentiment.

My dear Sir

As I understand from my friend Mr Bisset2 that Charles Villiers3 has
been interesting himself to obtain some government employment for him in
the way of his profession & has spoken or is likely to speak to you on
the subject, I think it but justice to Bisset to add any testimony which
I can give in his favour, to that which you will have received from
Villiers. I have known Bisset for many years during which he has
struggled hard and meritoriously to make his way in his profession (as a
conveyancer) supporting himself meanwhile as a writer, & though he has
had little success I believe it to be neither from want of ability nor
of legal learning. Coulson,4 whose pupil he Edition: current; Page: [35]
was, can speak to both points & it is much in his favour that he was
selected to edit the recent edition of Jarman on Wills5 (not the right
technical title I am afraid) which I understand he did very creditably.
Coulson feels I know considerable interest in him & thinks him competent
for many useful public duties & in particular “an excellent person to
collect digest & judge of information on any legal subject.” Coulson
thinks him not a likely person to succeed in the captation of attornies,
& advises him, I believe, rather to look for some permanent appointment
than to professional work to which his own wishes at present seem to
point. There are many situations which he would be very fit for but he
has no means of knowing when any are vacant or in what quarter an
application would have any chance. He has the feelings and habits of a
gentleman & may be depended on for conscientious care & pains taking in
all he undertakes.

He was for a short time employed under the original Poor Law Commission
& Senior probably could say something about him though he came very
little into direct contact with him.

Dear Hickson

I have no wish to enter into any discussion with Mr. Lombe.2 It is
useless discussing any such point with a man who thinks it is the
intention of nature that one race of mankind should be helots working
for another. Besides, I am certain he is an interested party. No one,
who was not, would select this question of all others as the one to
spend considerable sums of money in agitating about.

Edition: current; Page: [36]
I do not sympathize in the sentimental pity for the officers and
sailors. It is their own choice. They are not, like poor conscripts,
compelled to serve. In time of war indeed it is different as long as
impressment lasts.

What a droll mistake Adams3 has made about the Palace of Art—mistaking
the poet’s “soul” for a flesh and blood heroine.

Sept. 26th 1849.

Sir—

Your letter dated two months ago has from various causes remained too
long unanswered, & your present of the volume of your collected
writings,2 unacknowledged. I was already acquainted with some though not
all of your pamphlets,3 & had seen enough in them to convince me that
you had found the true explanation of the poverty & non improvement of
the Irish tenantry.4 The letting of the land, by a virtual auction, to
competitors much more numerous than the farms to be disposed of, whose
numbers are constantly increasing, & who have no means of subsistence
but by obtaining land on whatever terms, ensures their giving up to the
landlord the whole produce of the land minus a bare subsistence, &
putting themselves completely in his power by promising even more than
that. And as you have so Edition: current; Page: [37] well pointed out
it is impossible while this system lasts that the people can derive
benefit from anything which would otherwise tend to improve their
condition—the tenant being a mere channel through which the benefit,
whatever it may be, is diverted into the pocket of the landlord. Your
proposal of a valuation & a perpetuity is the only one that I am aware
of which goes to the root of the mischief. When I published the
treatise5 of which you make such flattering mention, I thought that a
perpetual tenure, either rentfree, or at a fixed low rent, conferred on
those who would occupy & reclaim waste lands, would be sufficient to
meet the evil. I thought that the distribution of the waste lands in
permanent property among the class of small farmers would draft off so
many of the competitors for the other lands, as to render the
competition innocuous, the rents moderate, the country tranquil, & by
removing the obstacle to the introduction of English capital enable the
peasantry to earn at least English wages.6 And I still believe that the
plan might have produced these effects if tried before the enactment of
the present Poor Law.7 That law however has commenced a train of events
which must terminate, I think, in the adoption of something equivalent
to your plan. Men who could not learn from reason, are learning from
experiment, that neither English buyers nor English farmers will take
land in Munster or Connaught subject to the liabilities of the poor law.
If therefore the land is to be cultivated at all, it must be by the
Irish peasantry; & as these, whether ejected or not, cannot now be
starved while the landlord has anything to give them, he will probably
in the end be obliged to bribe them to work by giving them an interest
in the land.

I lament that exertions so promising as those in which you were engaged
have been cut short by personal misfortunes. I trust there is yet a
chance of your being one day in a condition to renew those exertions, in
which I believe you would now find many more coadjutors than before. The
progress of events & of opinion has left such political economists as
those whose dicta you relate, very far behind, & their authority will
soon stand as low as it deserves. My object in writing a treatise on
Pol. Economy was to rescue from the hands of such people the truths they
misapply, & by combining these with other truths to which they are
strangers, to deduce conclusions capable of being of some use to the
progress of mankind. The sympathy you express in Edition: current; Page:
[38] this attempt induces me to request your acceptance of a copy of the
book, which I hope will reach you shortly after you receive this letter.

My dear Sir—

I return the Resolutions2 with some notes on two or three of them. You
will see that with the exception of the 8th Res. which seems to me
objectionable in toto, the fault I find with the plan is that it is a
kind of compromise—since it admits as much religious instruction as is
given in the Irish Edition: current; Page: [39] National Schools3 & not
only admits, but demands what is called moral instruction.

The stupid doctrines which alone the plan excludes generally lie dead in
the minds of children having hardly any effect, good or bad—the real
harm being done by the inculcation of the common moralities. I know that
compromises are often inevitable in practice, but I think they should be
left to the enemy to propose—reformers should assert principles & only
accept compromises.

I am very glad to see you active, & on so important a subject. There is
something like a stir beginning again among the liberal members of
parliament which will give a chance of a good following to whoever takes
the lead in anything useful.

[Notes appended to the above letter]

3rd Resolution. I would omit the words including moral instruction. What
the sort of people who will have the management of any such schools,
mean by moral instruction, is much the same thing as what they mean by
religious instruction, only lowered to the world’s practice. It means
cramming the children directly with all the common professions about
what is right & wrong & about the worth of different objects in life,
and filling them indirectly with the spirit of all the notions on such
matters which vulgar-minded people are in the habit of acting on without
consciously professing. I know it is impossible to prevent much of this
from being done—but the less of it there is the better, & I would not
set people upon doing more of it than they might otherwise do, by
insisting expressly on giving moral instruction.

If it were possible to provide for giving real moral instruction it
would be worth more than all else that schools can do. But no programme
of moral instruction which would be really good, would have a chance of
being assented to or followed by the manager of a general scheme of
public instruction in the present state of people’s minds.

5th Res. The National Schools of Ireland are, I believe, the best among
existing models; but they are unsectarian only in a narrow sense. They
are not unsectarian as between Christian & non-Christian. They are not
purely for secular instruction. They use selections from the Bible &
therefore teach the general recognition of that book as containing the
system & history of creation & the commands of an allwise & good being.
Any system of instruction which does this contains I conceive a great
part of all the mischief done by a purely Church or purely Dissenting
Education. Is it not better even in Edition: current; Page: [40] policy
to make the omission altogether of religion from State Schools the
avowed object.

8th Res. This seems to be very objectionable. If any public body were
empowered to prevent a person from practising as a teacher without a
certificate of competency, no person believed to think or act in
opposition to any of the ordinary standards, or who is supposed to be an
“unbeliever,” would ever be allowed to teach. No Socialist or even
Chartist would have (especially in times of political alarm) the
smallest chance. No such person could keep even a private school, much
less be a teacher in a public one. I have never seen the body that I
would trust with the power of pronouncing persons incompetent for this
or any other profession. Neither do I see what purpose this resolution
is intended to answer. No doubt, persons grossly incompetent do try to
get a living as schoolmasters, but the remedy for this is to provide
better ones, & the other resolutions ensure this in every district.
Besides this evil would soon take care of itself, if the mass of people
had even a little education.

Sir—

I have to acknowledge your communication of January 9th inclosing a
statement of the principles & objects of a proposed Association, which
you do me the honour of wishing that I should join, & inviting me to
communicate any observations which the paper suggests to me.

In some of the objects of the Address, & in some of the doctrines laid
down in it, there is much that I agree with. But the question is, I
think, more complicated than the writer seems to consider it. The
present mode of legal relief to the destitute2 was not adopted on any
such absurd ground as that “it is Edition: current; Page: [44] better
that the unemployed should be idle than usefully employed,” or better
that the funds expended in supporting them should be consumed without a
return, than with a return. The “principle” acted on was that by
selecting employment for paupers with reference to its suitableness as a
test for destitution, rather than to its productiveness, it was possible
to make the conditions of relief sufficiently undesirable, to prevent
its acceptance by any who could find private employment. But if the
state, or the parish, provides ordinary work at ordinary wages for all
the unemployed, the work so provided cannot be made less desirable, &
can scarcely be prevented from being more desirable, than any other
employment. It would therefore become necessary either that the state
should arbitrarily limit its operations (in which case no material
advantage would arise from their having been commenced) or that it
should be willing to take the whole productive industry of the country
under the direction of its own officers.

You will perhaps say that these consequences could only arise if the
work required in exchange for public pay were (as it usually has been)
merely nominal; & that you rely, for preventing such a consummation, on
the principle on which you justly lay so much stress, that of payment
proportionate to the work done. I confess I have no confidence that this
principle could be so applied as to have the effect intended. It was
tried (as I have understood) in the Irish Relief Works3 & in the
Ateliers Nationaux4 at Paris, & with the result which might be
expected—viz. that if the rate of payment by the piece was sufficiently
liberal not to overtask the feeble and unskilful, it enabled the strong
& experienced workman to earn so much with perfect ease, that all other
employment was rapidly deserted for that held out by the public.

My own opinion is that when productive employment can be claimed by
every one from the public as a right, it can only be rendered
undesirable by being made virtually slave labour; & I therefore
deprecate the enforcement of such a right, until society is prepared to
adopt the other side of the alternative, that of making the production &
distribution of wealth a public concern. I think it probable that to
this, in some form (though I would not undertake to say in what) the
world will come, but not without other great changes—certainly not in a
society composed like the present, of rich & poor; in which the
direction of industry by a public authority would be only substituting a
combination of rich men, armed with coercive power, for the competition
of individual capitalists.

Edition: current; Page: [45]
At present I expect very little from any plans which aim at improving
even the economical state of the people by purely economical or
political means. We have come, I think, to a period, when progress, even
of a political kind, is coming to a halt, by reason of the low
intellectual & moral state of all classes: of the rich as much as of the
poorer classes. Great improvements in Education (among the first of
which I reckon, dissevering it from bad religion) are the only thing to
which I should look for permanent good. For example, the objects of your
Association, & those of the promoters of Emigration, even if they could
be successful in putting an end to indigence, would do no more than push
off to another generation the necessity of adopting a sounder morality
on the subject of overpopulation—which sounder morality, even if it were
not necessary to prevent the evils of poverty, would equally be
requisite in order to put an end to the slavery to which the existing
state of things condemns women; a greater object, in my estimation, both
in itself & in its tendencies, than the mere physical existence either
of women or men. I am sorry to see in your Circular the ignorant &
immoral doctrine that the “separation”5 enforced in the workhouse is
among the sources of “degradation” & diminished “self-respect” for the
pauper. I consider it an essential part of the moral training, which, in
many ways (but in none more important) the reception of public relief
affords an opportunity of administering: & the improvement of which
would be a reform in Poor Law management, better worth aiming at, I
think, than that which you propose.

Sir—

I am sensible of the compliment paid to me by the promoters of the “Poor
Law Reform Association” in their willingness to make some modifications
in the terms of their Address if I should thus be enabled to concur in
it. But my differences from them are too wide to admit of cooperation.
My objection is not founded on any mischief which I expect from the
practical Edition: current; Page: [46] recommendations in the Address,
but on what seems to me the merely superficial character of everything
that it professes or contemplates. The plan will, I conceive, have no
effect at all on the permanent & hereditary paupers, who form the great
mass of the pauperism of the country. Manufacturing operatives are, as
you say, often thrown out of employment in great numbers at once, by the
vicissitudes of trade, & to find the means during such intervals, of
employing them so as to reproduce their subsistence, would be a useful
thing doubtless, but I cannot think that it would amount to any social
reform; it seems to me more the concern of the ratepayers than of any
one else. Of course I make no objection to considering & discussing the
means of doing this, but it is not a thing in which I feel called upon
to take a part.

It is not necessary that I should comment on the many things in your
letter with which I entirely disagree; I will merely observe on a matter
of fact, that though I am aware that piece work was not the original
principle either of the Irish relief works or of the ateliers
nationaux,2 I have a most distinct recollection that in one or other, &
I believe in both, it was had recourse to on failure of the original
plans, & with the effects which I mentioned.

I did not intend absolutely to pledge myself to an article for the Westr

article Edition: current; Page: [48] limited to the question of divorce.
I should treat that as only one point in a much more extensive
subject—the entire position which present laws & customs have made for
women. My opinions on the whole subject are so totally opposed to the
reigning notions, that it would probably be inexpedient to express all
of them & I must consider whether the portion of them which the state of
existing opinion would make it advisable to express, would be sufficient
to make the undertaking a suitable or satisfactory one to me. To decide
this I must turn over the subject in my mind for some little time.2

When I have made up my mind I will write again—in the meantime you must

You will tell me my own dearest dearest love, what has made you out of

spirits too—you know some time ago there was a Convention of Women in
Ohio to claim equal rights2—(& there is to be another in May)3 well,
there has just been a Convention for the same purpose in
Massachusetts4—chiefly of women, but with a great number of men,
including the chief slavery abolitionists Garrison,5 Wendell Phillips,6
the negro Douglas7 &c. The New York Tribune contains a long report8—most
of the speakers are women—& I never remember any public meetings or
agitation comparable to it in the proportion which good sense bears to
nonsense—while as to tone it is almost like ourselves speaking—outspoken
like America, not frightened & servile like England—not the least iota
of compromise—asserting the whole of the principle & claiming the whole
of the consequences, without any of the little feminine concessions and
reserves—the thing will evidently not drop, but will go on till it
succeeds, & I really do now think that we have a good chance of living
to see something decisive really accomplished on that of all practical
subjects the most important—to see that will be really looking down from
Pisgah on the promised land—how little I thought we should ever see it.

The days seem always short to me as they pass. The time that seems long,
the time that I am often impatient of the length of, is the time till
spring9—the Edition: current; Page: [50] time till we have a home, till
we are together in our life instead of this unsatisfactory this
depressing coming and going, in which all disagreeables have so much
more power than belongs to them, & the atmosphere of happiness has not

TO FREDERICK J. FURNIVALL1

19th November 1850

Sir—

I am not sure that I perceive precisely what is the point on which you
ask for a more distinct statement of my opinion.2 If it be this—whether
the social arrangements by which the possessors of capital are able to
appropriate to themselves the whole excess of the production above the
outlay, are good arrangements & such as it is desirable should
continue—I answer, no. But if the question be whether, those social
arrangements remaining as they are, a capitalist is morally bound to
give up to the workpeople whom he employs, all the profits of his
capital, after deducting interest at the market rate, & the day-wages of
his own labour (if any) my answer is, that I do not consider him to be
under this obligation.

The economics of society may be grounded either on the principle of
property or on that of community. The principle of property I understand
to be, that what any individuals have earned by their own labour, and
what the law permits them to be given to them by others, they are
allowed to dispose of at pleasure, for their own use, & are not, as you
seem to think, bound to hold it in trust for the public or for the poor.
This is a great advance, both in justice & in utility, above the mere
law of force, but far inferior to the law of community; & there is not &
cannot be any reason against the immediate adoption of some form of this
last, unless it be that mankind are not yet prepared for it.

But I do not therefore think it is the duty (though it may sometimes be
praiseworthy) of conscientious persons who have earned or acquired
property Edition: current; Page: [51] in the present imperfect social
scheme, to distribute their surplus among the poor. To attempt to give
all the reasons for this opinion would require a long ethical
discussion: but to consider it only economically:—The rule of private
property has at least the advantage, that it stimulates individuals to
thrive by their own energies: under communism there would be a just
division of exertion & of its fruits: but there is a tertium quid which
would be worse than either—namely that those who had failed to exert
themselves to thrive, should rely on having the difference made up to
them, either in the form of gifts or of a tax, by those who have so
thriven.

When you suggest the enforcement by law, if possible, on all
capitalists, of this proposed abnegation of any profit beyond a moderate
interest, you in fact propose to abolish the law of property “in its
present form” (to repeat the words I used). I have no objection to that,
but it has to be shewn if there is any halting place, short of
communism. I am open to any lights on the subject; but the occasion was
not suitable for entering into it before the Committee.3

22d Nov. 1850

Dear Coulson

Since receiving your note I have read Mr Kingsley’s article.2 I think it
an effective piece of controversial writing; & as against the Edinburgh
Professor3 whom he attacks, he has the best of the argument. I agree
with him that if farmers cannot cultivate with a profit under free trade
the fault is in their own ignorance & indolence or the greediness of
their landlords—& also that if farmers cannot or will not do it, peasant
proprietors Edition: current; Page: [52] or cooperative villages can. If
I could really think that free trade would break up the present system
of landlords farmers & labourers for hire, I should think the repeal of
the corn laws4 a far greater & more beneficial event than I have
hitherto believed it.

In the imaginary dialogue between Common Sense & a Protectionist,5 there
are several propositions of political economy which I think erroneous,
1st, Corn laws make food dearer, but I do not agree in the proposition
that they make it less plentiful. If, notwithstanding the higher price,
the consumers are willing to buy the same quantity, the same quantity
will be produced. 2nd, I do not admit that cheap food makes other things
cheap, since it does not diminish the cost of producing or importing
other things. 3rd. Neither do I think that the cheapening of food
necessarily lowers wages. When it does so, it is only gradually, by
giving a stimulus to population, unless there is already a surplus of
unemployed labourers supported by charity. 4thly. When the fall of wages
comes (if it does come) I agree with the writer, that wages do not fall
in proportion to the fall in the price of food; for the reason he gives,
viz. that wages are not wholly spent on food, but partly on things which
have not fallen; & for example if half the labourer’s expenditure
consists of food, & food falls ten per cent, the utmost fall of wages
which would ensue would be five per cent. But the writer seems to forget
that by the hypothesis, a fall of five per cent in wages would be
sufficient to deprive the labourer of all advantage from the fall of ten
per cent in food; so that his argument proves nothing for his purpose.

On a subject which has been so much & so well discussed as the free
trade question one has no right to require new ideas. There is an
original idea in the article, but I am afraid it is an erroneous one.
The writer says, that animals give back to the soil (when there is no
waste of manure) all the material which they take from it in nutriment,
& he thinks this proves that however much population might increase
production would increase in the same ratio. I apprehend it only proves
that the power of production needs never be exhausted, but not that it
admits of indefinite increase. To make out his point he must maintain
that the soil will yield a double produce on the application of a double
quantity of manure. So far from this, it is well known that manuring
beyond a certain amount injures the crop.

The remainder of the political economy of the article I agreed with, to
the best of my remembrance—but much of the incidental matter I totally
dissent from. It is not Mr K’s socialism6 that stands in the way of our
agreement; Edition: current; Page: [53] I am far more a Socialist than
he is. It is the old, not the new part of his opinions which forms the
gulph between us. This very article talks of “the righteous judgments of
one who visits the sins of the fathers upon the children.” To such a
degree does religion or what is so called, pervert morality. How can
morality be anything but the chaos it now is, when the ideas of right &
wrong, just & unjust, must be wrenched into accordance either with the
notions of a tribe of barbarians in a corner of Syria three thousand
years ago, or with what is called the order of Providence; in other
words, the course of nature, of which so great a part is tyranny &
iniquity—all the things which are punished as the most atrocious crimes
when done by human creatures, being the daily doings of nature through
the whole range of organic life.

Mr K’s notions must be little less vague about my political economy than
about my socialism when he couples my name7 with that of a mere tyro
like H. Martineau.8

Sir,

To answer the questions2 you put to me, even in their principal
bearings, would be to write an Essay—& my whole time would hardly
suffice to give satisfactory answers to all the questions I am asked by
correspondents previously unknown to me. I may say briefly, that if an
employer of labour felt bound to divide his profits justly, that is, on
some principle of equality among all persons concerned, it is by no
means certain that he would in the present state of society & education
do a benefit to the individuals equivalent to his sacrifice—& still less
certain that he could not, in some other manner, make the same amount of
sacrifices instrumental to some greater good. These conditions at least
seem to be necessary to make such conduct obligatory. I do not give this
as a complete but only as an obvious answer.

Edition: current; Page: [54]
With regard to the last point in your letter,3 I should be glad to see
Leclaire’s system4 generally adopted, and should not object to it being
made compulsory by law if I thought such a law could be executed: but
the execution of it would require that the state should fix, not only
the interest of capital (which it might do), but the wages of the
labourers, the salary for superintendence, & the remuneration for risk
of capital: & as these are variable elements, they could not be
determined by law, but only by some officer pro hac vice. If the state
is to exercise this power, it would be better in many respects, &
probably not worse in any, that the state should take all the capital of
the country, paying interest for it, & become itself the sole employer
of labour, which would be communism.

I am Sir

Dear Sir—

I beg that you will make my respectful acknowledgments to the Council of

proposal, communicated through you & Mr Duffy & by the very flattering
terms of their Resolution. If it were in my power to go into parliament
at present I should be highly gratified by being returned for a purpose
so congenial to my principles & convictions3 as the reform of the
pernicious system of landed tenure which more than any other cause keeps
the great body of the agricultural population of Ireland always on the
verge of starvation. You are aware however that I hold an office under
the E[ast] I[ndia] C[ompany] which of necessity occupies a large portion
of my time: & I have reason to believe that the C[ourt] of D[irectors]
would consider a seat in parliament as incompatible with it. Whatever
therefore I might have done under other circumstances, I am compelled to
decline the offered honour—& I feel it right to do so at once, rather
than (as you suggest) to leave the question in any degree open, since I
could not in fairness allow any trouble to be taken for a purpose which
would merely give greater publicity to the honour intended me, while I
could not hold out the prospect of its leading to any practical result.

Edition: current; Page: [59]
With regard to the wish entertained by the Council to reprint in a
separate form such passages of my Pol. Ec. as they may think likely to
be useful to their cause, any such proposal can only be made to my
publisher Mr Parker to whom I have parted with the property of the
present edition. Should he give his consent I shall most willingly give
mine; but the application could not with any propriety be made to him by
myself. In any future edition of the book there will doubtless, as you
observe, be much to alter & improve in the parts relating to Ireland,
but it would not be fair to Mr Parker that I should publish these
improvements before the present edition is exhausted.

Dear Hickson

The new number of the Westr is a woful specimen of the new
editorship2—the general character of the writing is verbose
emptiness—feebleness of stile, & total absence of thought or of any
decided opinion on any subject. In the midst of the vapid want of
meaning, only two things stand out prominently: one of these is a very
vulgar attack3 on H. Martineau’s book for Edition: current; Page: [62]
irreligion—the other, in the small print at the end, is a denunciation
of the author of “Social Statics”4 for “pushing his conclusions too far”
on the “rights of women and children” “from not perceiving with
sufficient clearness that no one can have a valid claim to a right
without the capacity for performing its correlative duty”—the article I
proposed to you on the rights of women5 narrowly missed being bound up
with this despicable trash! It is hard to see a review that so many have
worked in for advanced opinions, thus sunk in the mud—to see it
converted into an organ against its former opinions.

Is it not possible that Mr. Lombe,6 being so zealous & liberal, would as
soon spend the money he now gives for single articles in being
proprietor of the review? If a paid manager were provided for the
business department, perhaps the literary editorship, without the
pecuniary responsibility, would not be more than you might be willing to
retain, for the sake of preserving an organ of really free opinions? I
feel so strongly on the subject that if you would not like to make the
suggestion yourself, I should have no objection to write to Mr Lombe
proposing it, & offering to give you & him all the help that my other
occupations admit of. Do tell me what you think of the whole matter.

I am afraid, all that I could engage to do towards carrying on the Westr
would be to write for it often, & to give the best of my judgment on the
choice of subjects & articles. If I were to undertake the editorship,
though without the mere business department, so much time & exertion
would be required, that I could not write anything else of importance,—&
I think I can now do more for my opinions by writing books than by the
best I could hope to make of the review. While I should be glad to
second any plan for preserving the review, I cannot be the pivot on
which the plan turns. If I thought that £500 expended on the review
would have the effect you seem to think it would—if it would enable the
Westr to take the place of the Edinburgh—I would gladly help to raise
it—but I do not think there is any probability of much. . . .2

TO SIR GEORGE GREY1

May 5. 1851

Sir—

I hope I may be pardoned for addressing to you in this form rather than
through the newspapers, a remonstrance against the gross insult to every
woman in the country, which has found its way into the Govt bill now
passing through the H. of C. for regulating the sale of arsenic.2 The
clause, which did not form part of the bill as it came from the hands of
its framers, but was added in the H. of L. at the suggestion of some
unknown person, is that which forbids arsenic to be sold in less
quantity than ten pounds to any person “other than a male person of full
age”—all women, from the highest to the lowest, being declared unfit to
have poison in their possession, lest Edition: current; Page: [64] they
shall commit murder. It is impossible to believe that so monstrous a
proposition could have obtained the assent of Govt except through
inadvertence—& an individual, though personally unknown to you, may hope
to be excused if at the hazard of being thought intrusive, he takes such
means as are in his power of soliciting from you that attention to the
subject which he is persuaded cannot yet have been given to it.

If the bill passes with this clause, it is a retrograde step in
legislation, a return to the ideas and practices of barbarous ages. One
of the characteristics of the improved spirit of the present time is the
growing tendency to the elevation of women—towards their relief from
disabilities, their increased estimation, the assignment to them of a
higher position, both social & domestic. But this clause is a blind step
in the reverse direction. It singles out women for the purpose of
degrading them. It establishes a special restriction, a peculiar
disqualification against them alone. It assumes that women are more
addicted than men to committing murder! Does the criminal calendar, or
the proceedings of the police courts, shew a preponderance of women
among the most atrocious criminals? Everybody knows that the direct
contrary is the truth, & that men outnumber women in the records of
crime, in the ratio of four to one. On what supposition are men to be
trusted with poisons & women not, unless that of their peculiar
wickedness? While the spirit of the age & the tendency of all
improvement is to make women the equals of men, this bill puts on them
the stamp of the most degrading inferiority, precisely where the common
voice of mankind proclaims them superior—in moral goodness.

If all the restrictions imposed by this bill were common to men & women,
it would be giving up pro tanto the peculiar, & one of the most valuable
characteristics of English freedom; it would be treating all mankind,
except the government & its agents, as children; but it would be giving
an equal measure of justice to all, & would be no insult or
disparagement peculiarly to any. The legislature will not declare that
Englishmen cannot be trusted with poisons, but it is not ashamed to
assert that Englishwomen cannot. A law which if common to both would be
merely a specimen of timidity & over caution, is when limited to women,
a legislative declaration that Englishwomen are poisoners—Englishwomen
as a class—as distinguished from Englishmen. And for what reason, or
under what incitement is this insult passed upon them? Because among the
last dozen murders there were two or three cases, which attracted some
public attention, of poisoning by women. Is it the part of a legislature
to shape its laws to the accidental peculiarities of the latest crime
reported in the newspapers? If the last two or three murderers had been
men with red hair, as well might Parliament have rushed to pass an Act
restricting all red haired men from buying or possessing deadly weapons.

Edition: current; Page: [65]
The silence of all who from their position could have made their voice
heard, will I hope be my excuse for addressing to you, even at so late a
period, this appeal.

You have, I doubt not, chosen the best of the offers made to you for the

it that since you have decided to let Chapman have the review, he does

The printer has only this morning sent the proof. I should wish to keep
it as long as you can conveniently let me. It is necessary on such a
subject to be as far as possible invulnerable. I have not quite fixed on
a heading. The best I have thought of is “Enfranchisement of Women.” The
one you propose with the word “sex” in it would never do. That word is
enough to vulgarize a whole review. It is almost as bad as “female.”

A young friend2 of mine is writing an article on a new Life of Gregory
Nazianzus3 intending to offer it to you for this number: would the
subject suit you? It is on the tapis just now.

Edition: current; Page: [67]
Perhaps Burton’s Political and Social Economy,4 or Spencer’s Social

TO JOHN CHAPMAN1

India House

June 9. 1851.

Sir—

I have read the Prospectus2 on which you ask my opinion, & I now put
down some of the remarks which occur to me on the subject. The
Prospectus Edition: current; Page: [68] is addressed to “the friends of
philosophic Reform”; I think this a bad phrase. “Philosophic Reformers”
is a worn-out & gone by expression; it had a meaning twenty years ago.3
“Philosophic reform” does not, to my mind, carry any meaning at
all—unless to signify a reform in philosophy.

The Prospectus says, that the Review is to be distinctly characterised
by “certain definite but broad principles”: but instead of laying down
any such principles it contains little else than details of the measures
which the review will advocate on the principal political questions just
now discussed in the newspapers. The only sentence which seems intended
for a declaration of principles is that forming the third paragraph—&
this, so far from “distinctly characterising” any set of opinions or
course of conduct, contains nothing to distinguish the review from any
liberal or semi liberal newspaper or periodical, or from anybody who
says he is for reform but not for revolution. The doctrine stated, such
as it is, I do not agree in. Instead of thinking that “strength &
durability are the result only of a slow & peaceful development,” I
think that changes effected rapidly & by force are often the only ones
which in given circumstances would be permanent: & by the statement that
“reforms to be salutary must be graduated to the average moral &
intellectual growth of society” I presume is meant (though I am by no
means sure about the meaning if any) that the measures of a government
ought never to be in advance of the average intellect & virtue of the
people—according to which doctrine there would neither have been the
Reformation, the Commonwealth, nor the Revolution of 1688, & the
stupidity & habitual indifference of the mass of mankind would bear down
by its dead weight all the efforts of the more intelligent & active
minded few.

The Prospectus says “the review will not neglect that important range of
subjects which are related to Politics as an inner concentric circle, &
which have been included under the term Sociology.” I understand by
Sociology not a particular class of subjects included within Politics,
but a vast field including it—the whole field of enquiry & speculation
respecting human society & its arrangements, of which the forms of
government, & the principles of the conduct of governments are but a
part. And it seems to me impossible that even the politics of the day
can be discussed on principle, or with a view to anything but the
exigencies of the moment, unless by setting out from definite opinions
respecting social questions more fundamental than what is commonly
called politics. I cannot, therefore, understand how a review making the
professions which the Prospectus does, can treat such questions as a
particular “range of subjects” which will merely not be neglected, & on
which “diverse theories” will be considered with a Edition: current;
Page: [69] view chiefly to ascertain “how far our efforts after a more
perfect social state must be restrained” by certain conditions
mentioned. I confess it seems to me, the only worthy object of a Review
of Progress is to consider how far & in what manner such objects may be
promoted, & how the obstacles, whether arising from the cause mentioned
or from any other, may most effectually be overcome.

In conclusion, I think it right to say that if your wish to consult me
respecting the Westminster Review arises from any belief that I am
likely to be a contributor to it, I can hold out no prospect that the
expectation will be realized. My willingness to contribute even
occasionally to the Westr under any new management4 would entirely

Dear Hickson

I am surprised to see by the revise of my article2 that you have made
two verbal alterations. I gave you the article on an understood
consideration, the only one on which I ever write, that no alterations
should be made by anyone but myself, & from this condition I cannot
depart. I have returned the corrected revise to the printer. I should be
obliged by your letting me have (if possible before the review is out)
twenty-five separate copies, at my expense. I wish for no title page,
but in place of it a page with only the words “Reprinted from the
Westminster Review for July 1851.” I should like to see a proof of the
reprint.

I send the short article3 I mentioned to you. The subject may make an
agreeable variety.

Yours truly,

9th June 1851

Dear Sir

From what I have read of the writings of the Christian Socialists, &
from the communications which I have had with some of them,2 I have
found their principles & mine to be too radically opposed for any verbal
explanation or discussion between us to be of advantage. I think quite
as unfavourably of the present constitution of society as they
do—probably much more so; & I look forward to alterations extending to
many more, & more important points than the relation between masters &
workmen: I should not expect much practical benefit from a modification
of that single relation, without changes fully as great in existing
opinions & institutions on religious moral & domestic subjects, all of
which the Christian Socialists desire to preserve,—or without accepting
& acting upon principles of political & social economy which they
reject. So far as they promote experiments on the association of
workpeople,3 & so far as they cultivate, in any workpeople under their
influence the dispositions & habits which tend to make association
practicable & beneficial, I approve their intention & applaud their
efforts: but even where my objects are the same with theirs, my premises
are mostly so different, that my path & theirs must lie separate, & I
must beg you to excuse me from joining in your proposed conferences with
them

The article on Gregory2 must wait if necessary, till the October

young man of promise, who it is desirable should be encouraged to write.
If not used at present you will perhaps send it back, as it was written
hastily in the expectation of being wanted for the July number, & if
time were taken for its revision it could probably be improved.

I have to apologize for the delay in answering your note of April 23. I
was out of town when it arrived. When I returned it was hastily looked
at & thrown aside with other papers, & though I read & was much
interested by the pamphlet which accompanied it, I had forgotten until
the note accidentally turned up the other day, that you had ever written
asking my opinion of the plan: especially as you were already aware from
our conversation when you were in London, that I thought very favourably
of it. This favourable opinion has been confirmed by reading the
pamphlet.2 The machinery of the scheme seems unobjectionable—the success
of the Land Societies in England demonstrates its feasibility: & it is
open to none of the objections which old prejudice urges against any
more summary mode of creating a body of small landholders owning the
land they cultivate.

I fully understood that the Prospectus you sent me was not finally
determined on.2 As you asked for my opinion, I gave it freely—& I can
have no objection, if desired, to tell you with the same freedom what I
think of any future one3—but to give positive suggestions, only belongs
to those whose organ the work is to be. Those only can prepare the
programme who are to conduct the review—since they best know what they
intend, & what they have the power to accomplish.

The reason you give for what you very truly call the air of conservatism
in the Prospectus, is intelligible; but does not seem to me to render
advisable the use of expressions giving the idea that the Westr no
longer wishes to be considered as professing extreme opinions. The
review was founded by people who held what were then thought extreme
opinions,4 & it is only needed as an organ of opinions as much in
advance of the present state of the public mind as those were in advance
of its then state. Anything less is but child’s play after the events of
the last three years in Europe & besides, every intermediate position is
fully occupied by other periodicals.

I have long ceased to be surprised at any want of good sense or good
manners in what proceeds from you—you appear to be too thoughtless or
too ignorant to be capable of either—but such want of good feeling,
together with such arrogant assumption, as are shown in your letters to
my wife & to Haji I was not prepared for.2 The best construction that
can be put upon them is that you really do not know what insolence and
presumption are: Edition: current; Page: [74] or you would not write
such letters & seem to expect to be as well liked as before by those to
whom & of whom they are written. You were “surprised,” truly, at our
marriage & do not “know enough of the circumstances to be able to form
an opinion on the subject.” Who asks you to form an opinion? An opinion
on what? Do men usually when they marry consult the opinion of a brother
twenty years younger than themselves? or at my age of any brother or
person at all? But though you form no “opinion” you presume to catechize
Haji respecting his mother, & call her to account before your tribunal
for the conformity between her conduct & her principles—being at the
same time, as you say yourself, totally ignorant what her principles
are. On the part of any one who avowedly does not know what her
principles are, the surmise that she may have acted contrary to them is
a gratuitous impertinence. To every one who knows her it would be
unnecessary to say that she has, in this as in all things, acted
according to her principles. What imaginary principles are they which
should prevent people who have known each other the greater part of
their lives, during which her & Mr. Taylor’s house has been more a home
to me than any other, and who agree perfectly in all their opinions,
from marrying?

You profess to have taken great offence because you knew of our intended
marriage “only at second hand.” People generally hear of marriages at
“second hand”, I believe. If you mean that I did not write to you on the
subject, I do not know any reason you had to expect that I should. I
informed your mother & sisters who I knew would inform you—& I did not
tell them of it on account of any right they had to be informed, for my
relations with any of them have been always of too cool & distant a kind
to give them the slightest right or reason to expect anything more than
ordinary civility from me—& when I did tell them I did not receive
ordinary civility in return. In the dissertation on my character with
which you favour Haji, you shew yourself quite aware that it has never
been my habit to talk to them about my concerns—& assuredly the feelings
you have shown to me in the last two or three years have not been so
friendly as to give me any cause for making you an exception. As for the
“mystery” which on my father’s authority you Edition: current; Page:
[75] charge me with, if we are to bandy my father’s sayings I could cite
plenty of them about all his family except the younger ones, compared
with which this is very innocent. It could be said at all but as a half
joke—& every one has a right to be mysterious if they like. But I have
not been mysterious, for I had never anything to be mysterious about. I
have not been in the habit of talking unasked about my friends, or
indeed about any other subject.3

Having been out of town when your note dated the 10th was sent to the

seen Edition: current; Page: [77] for very many years, knows nothing
whatever of me or of my literary engagements. I have never had any
intention of writing on Comte’s book,3 nor do I think that a translation
or an abridgement of it is likely to be either useful or successful.

I am quite unable to point out any one whom I think in any degree
competent to write an article on Asiatic life, of the comprehensive kind
which you appear to desire. Writers capable of treating any large
subject in a large & free manner, along with precision & definiteness of
meaning, seem to be rarer than ever in this country. The vast subject

Dear Hickson

You cannot expect me to like an article2 of which the conclusions are so
opposite to mine; & as I do not think that they admit of being supported
by good arguments, this implies that I think yours fallacious. The
strong points seem to me some of your replies to other people’s
arguments, but your own appear to me no better than those you reply to.
To mention minor matters—there are two mistakes in the Greek which it
would be well to correct. Pyrrho (the sceptic) is printed Pyrrhus (king
of Epirus), & Academus, a man’s name, is printed instead of the Academy
or the Academics. It is impossible Edition: current; Page: [78] to say
The Academus. (A propos the Greek in the article on Gregory3 is very
incorrectly printed).

If I should criticize on a matter of taste, I should say that your
article loses altogether in appearance of strength by the capitals and
italics. Italics are bad enough but Capitals make anything look weak.

The article on Newman4 is spoilt by printer’s punctuation &
typographical errors.

I wonder that you as the representative of the old sterling Westminster
Review opinions, should have allowed to be printed in it vulgar
misrepresentation of Bentham, its founder;5 vilifying a man who has done
more for the world than any man of modern times, by talking about “the
Gospel according to Jeremy Bentham” as synonymous with the most
grovelling selfishness. (There is no selfishness in Bentham’s
doctrines). I think you should have struck out both that expression and
also the “godless Benthamism” because intended for abuse.

It is a pity that a man of Mr. Lombe’s public spirit has not made a
better use of £500 than giving it for a translation of Comte6—whose book
can be read in French by anybody likely to read it at all, or who could
derive any benefit from the only good part of it, the scientific, for
his opinions on social matters are very bad. H. Martineau besides cannot
translate the mathematics which is the principal thing in the book.

The article in the Globe7 is evidently by Newman. He is in a furious
rage, & means to be as offensive as he knows how to be, but he is such a
poor creature, so terrified at anything like really free opinions & so
in awe of the gone-by phrases about them, that he thinks the severest
thing he can say of the writer of the article is to charge him, in those
gone-by phrases, with the very opinions which the article itself
professes.

I like the altered Prospectus2 better than the first; but I should have
greatly preferred a simple & plain expression of the plan & principles
intended to be followed. The Prospectus still seems to me to rely on
sound rather than on sense; the only distinct statement of opinion being
on the mere newspaper topics of the day. Some expressions seem to me
more than questionable: for instance “free trade in every department of
commerce”—this must mean “free trade in every department of trade.”

TO THE REV. HENRY WILLIAM CARR1

7th January 1852.

Sir—

Want of time has prevented me from returning an earlier answer to your
letter of 31st December. The question you ask me is one of the most
difficult which any one can put either to others or to himself, namely,
how to teach social science to the uneducated, when those who are called
the educated have not learnt it; and nearly all the teaching given from
authority is opposed to genuine morality.

What the poor as well as the rich require is not to be indoctrinated, is
not to be taught other people’s opinions, but to be induced and enabled
to think for themselves. It is not physical science that will do this,
even if they could learn it much more thoroughly than they are able to
do. After reading, writing, and arithmetic (the last a most important
discipline in habits of accuracy and precision, in which they are
extremely deficient), the desirable thing for them seems to be the most
miscellaneous information, and the most varied exercise of their
faculties. They cannot read too much. Quantity is of more importance
than quality, especially all reading which relates to human life and the
ways of mankind; geography, voyages and travels, manners and customs,
and romances, which must tend to awaken their imagination and give them
some of the meaning of self-devotion and heroism, in short, to
unbrutalise them. By such reading they would become, to a certain
extent, cultivated beings, which they would not become by following out,
even to the greatest length, physical science. As for education in the
best sense of the term, I fear they have a long time to wait for it. The
higher and middle classes cannot educate the working classes unless they
are first educated themselves. The miserable pretence of education,
which those classes now receive, does not form minds fit to undertake
the guidance of other minds, or to exercise a beneficient influence over
them by personal contact. Still, any person who sincerely desires
whatever is for the good of all, however it may affect himself or his
own class, and who regards the great social questions as matters of
reason and discussion and not as settled long ago, may, I believe, do a
certain Edition: current; Page: [81] amount of good by merely saying to
the working classes whatever he sincerely thinks on the subjects on
which they are interested. Free discussion with them as equals, in
speech and in writing, seems the best instruction that can be given
them, specially on social subjects.

With regard to the social questions now before the public, and in which,
as I gather from your letter, the working classes of your town have
begun to take an interest, it seems to me chiefly important to impress
on them—first, that they are quite right in aiming at a more equal
distribution of wealth and social advantages; secondly, that this more
equal distribution can only be permanently affected (for merely taking
from Peter to give to Paul would leave things worse than even at
present) by means of their own public spirit and self-devotion as
regards others, and prudence and self-restraint in relation to
themselves. At present their idea of social reform appears to be simply
higher wages, and less work, for the sake of more sensual indulgence. To
be independent of master manufacturers, to work for themselves and
divide the whole produce of their labour is a worthy object of ambition,
but it is only fit for, and can only succeed with people who can labour
for the community of which they are a part with the same energy and zeal
as if labouring for their own private and separate interest (the
opposite is now the case), and who, instead of expecting immediately
more pay and less work, are willing to submit to any privation until
they have effected their emancipation. The French working men and women
contended for a principle, for an idea of justice, and they lived on
bread and water till they gained their purpose. It was not more and
costlier eating and drinking that was their object, as it seems to be
the sole object of most of the well-paid English artisans.

If in applying to me you hoped that I might be able to offer you any
suggestions of more specific character, I hope you will attribute my not
doing so to the difficulty of the subject and not to any want of will on
my part.

Dear Sir—

The pressure of my occupations has left me no leisure until now to
answer your letter & to thank you for the volume of your translation of
Edition: current; Page: [85] my Pol. Ec. which you were so good as to
send me. As far as I have had time to examine it the translation seems
extremely well executed: the sense appears to be very faithfully &
clearly rendered. I only regret that your time & pains were not bestowed
on the edition which is now about to go to press & which I have not only
revised throughout but have entirely recast several important chapters;
in particular the two most important, those on Property & on the
Futurity of the Labouring Classes.2 The progress of discussion & of
European events has entirely altered the aspect of the questions treated
in those chapters; the present time admits of a much more free & full
enunciation of my opinions on those subjects than would have had any
chance of an impartial hearing when the book was first written; & some
change has also taken place in the opinions themselves. I observe that
in your preface you recommend the book to your readers as a refutation
of Socialism: I certainly was far from intending that the statement it
contained of the objections to the best known Socialist schemes should
be understood as a condemnation of Socialism regarded as an ultimate
result of human improvement, & further consideration has led me to
attach much less weight than I then did even to those objections, with
one single exception—the unprepared state of the labouring classes &
their extreme moral unfitness at present for the rights which Socialism
would confer & the duties it would impose. This is the only objection to
which you will find any great importance attached in the new edition; &
I am sorry that your translation should place before German readers as a
current statement of my opinions what has ceased to be so. You propose
to give in the 2d vol. an account of the alterations in the new edition:
as far as concerns the points which I have mentioned nothing less than a
retranslation of the two chapters as they now stand, would enable your
work to represent my opinions correctly. I shall be happy to send the
sheets of the new edition in the manner pointed out by you, & the first
parcel shall be made up as soon as I am able to include in it the
chapter which contains the discussion of Socialism.

Dear Sir—

My occupations have prevented me until now from acknowledging the letter
with which you favoured me as long ago as the 6th of February. It is not
wonderful that staying but a short time in London2 & occupied as you
were during that stay you had not time for the somewhat idle and
generally very useless task of paying visits.

Though my references3 to your systematic work4 were confined to the
Brussels translation,5 I am glad to say that I am able to read it in the
original. Your writings6 indeed are the part with which I am best
acquainted, of the German writers on pol. economy, in which as you
justly surmise, I am not by any means well read. What you say of
McCulloch7 does not surprise me. He is both prejudiced & inaccurate. I
never place any confidence in the first edition of any of his books: but
as the plan of most of them is good, people generally supply him with
information which enables him to improve them very much in the second.
His “Literature of Pol. Ec.”8 has however I shd think, but a small
chance of making a second edition. Your plan of separating the
scientific inquiry into the production & distribution of wealth, as a
branch of social science, from the consideration of the economic policy
of governments, appears to me both logically & didactically the best, &
I have made the same separation in my own treatise. Of this I am just
about to print a new edition in which among various other improvements I
have entirely rewritten the chapter which contains the discussion of
Socialism, & the Edition: current; Page: [87] greater part of that on
the futurity of the labouring classes.9 I regret that the German
translation of which one volume was lately published at Hamburg,10 was
made from the previous edit., as it gives in many respects an erroneous
idea of my opinions on Socialism. Even in the former editions though I
stated a number of objections to the best known Socialist theories, I
never represented those objections as final & conclusive & I think them
of very little weight so far as regards the ultimate prospects of
humanity. It is true that the low moral state of mankind generally and
of the labouring classes in particular, renders them at present unfit
for any order of things which would presuppose as its necessary
condition a certain measure of conscience & of intellect. But it appears
to me that the great end of social improvement should be to fit them by
cultivation for a state of society combining the greatest personal
freedom with that just distribution of the fruits of labour which the
present laws of property do not even profess to aim at. To explain what
I mean by a just distribution & to what extent I think it could be
approximated to a practice would require more space than that of a
letter. I confess that I regard the purely abstract investigations of
pol. economy (beyond those elementary ones which are necessary for the
correction of mischievous prejudices) as of very minor importance
compared with the great practical questions which the progress of
democracy & the spread of Socialist opinions are pressing on, & for
which both the governing and the governed classes are very far from
being in a fit state of mental preparation. It is to be decided whether
Europe shall enter peacefully & prosperously into a better order of
things or whether the new ideas will be inaugurated by a century of war
& violence like that which followed the Reformation of Luther: and this
alternative probably depends on the moral & intellectual movement of the
next ten or twenty years. There is therefore abundance of occupation for
moral & political teachers such as we aspire to be.

Dear Sir—

I have delayed too long to acknowledge your two letters & the remittance
of £120. Wishing to do the best I could for forwarding your objects in
connexion with the Poona Useful Knowledge Society but knowing Edition:
current; Page: [88] little about tools or the best mode of procuring
them I put your letters into the hands of Mr Cowper,2 Professor of
Manufacturing Art at King’s College, London, who was the most likely
person I could think of to be able & willing to do what you wished to be
done. Mr Cowper undertook to make the necessary enquiries & gave hopes
that he would procure the articles themselves & in the expectation of
hearing from him I continually put off writing to you. When at last I
wrote to remind him I received an answer which I inclose3 & in which you
will find the reasons he gives why more has not yet been done. I have
not received the further letter which he promises but I do not like to
keep you any longer without a reply. You do not I suppose wish to view
some of the things until all are ready & if you have any instructions to
give about the mode of sending they may very likely arrive in time to be
of use.

I am much interested by what I know both from yourself & otherwise of
your exertions to instruct & improve the natives. Everything shews them
to be eminently improvable & your Society at Poona seems to be a
striking example of the spirit which is abroad among a portion of them,
& of the great effect which may be produced even in a short time, by
well directed efforts for their improvement. I am glad that you have
found my writings useful to your pupils. I have to thank you for the
Bombay papers containing your series of articles on Newman’s Pol Ec.
lectures.4 It is but a poor book as you appear to think though you treat
him very civilly. I agree in most of your remarks as well as in your
just appreciation of the great teachers of political economy,
particularly Ricardo.5 Of what you say about my own book I should be
happy to think that it is not too complimentary. The edition which I
have just begun to print will be, I hope, a great improvement on the
first & second, the chapters on Socialism & on the Future of the
Labouring Classes having been so much altered as to be almost entirely
new.6 In your review of Newman the remarks on population are the only
part which I must express dissent from, for though you agree in the main
with Malthus you appear to think that no one ought to be blamed for
having an inordinately large family if he produces, & brings them up to
produce, enough for their support: now this with me is only a part &
even a small part of the question: a much more important consideration
still, is the perpetuation of the previous degradation & slavery of
women, no alteration in which can be hoped for while their whole lives
are devoted to the function of producing & rearing children. That
degradation & slavery is in itself so enormous an evil, & contributes
Edition: current; Page: [89] so much to the perpetuation of all other
evils by keeping down the moral & intellectual condition of both men &
women that the limitation of the number of children would be in my
opinion absolutely necessary to place human life on its proper footing,
even if there were subsistence for any number that could be produced. I
think if you had been alive to this aspect of the question you would not
have used such expressions as “your wife has made you a happy father
rather more frequently than you are pleased to remember.” Such phrases
are an attempt to laugh off the fact that the wife is in every sense the
victim of the man’s animal instinct & not the less so because she is
brought up to think that she has no right of refusal or even of
complaint.

In reply to your note dated the 14th I beg to say that I am unwilling to

far as I am able to judge, I should think that a registry office or
general house of call for ballast heavers would be useful, by taking
them out of the hands of the public house keepers, but I should not be
disposed to make it compulsory on employers to apply in the first
instance to the registry office. The best conducted workmen would be to
be heard of there, & I would trust to that inducement. I say this

Sir,

Owing to the absence of the late Editor of the Westminster Review from
England, your letter of March 22. only reached me by post yesterday. I
lose no time in writing to say that I am not Editor of the Westminster
Review and have no connection whatever with it. I saw for the first time
two days ago the present proprietor, Mr. John Chapman, bookseller and
publisher 142 Strand, who bought the review last year, and who has the
entire control of it. The mode in which I thought I could best promote
your wishes was by sending your letter to Mr. Chapman, which I have
accordingly done. The article2 to which you refer as a specimen has not
reached me: if it does, I will send that also to Mr. Chapman.

Dear Sir

I have been so much more even than usually occupied since your letter
and its inclosures reached me that I have put off acknowledging them
from day to day & am now obliged to be more concise in my
acknowledgments than I should like to be. Let me first express my
sincere regret at the cause Edition: current; Page: [91] of your long
abstinence from writing which however great a private evil is a greater
public loss.2

With regard to the manner in which I am spoken of in the Preface3 I
could not possibly have any other objection to it than that it is far
too complimentary, except indeed that it is not agreeable to me to be
praised in the words of a man whom I so wholly disrespect as Milton,4
who with all his republicanism had the soul of a fanatic a despot & a
tyrant. With respect to the difference of opinion between us on the
point of political economy discussed in your book you do me no more than
justice in believing that I am open to evidence & argument on that & on
all subjects. But your argument turning on the annual exchange of the
capital of a country against the sum of its money incomes, is not new to
me: I am familiar with it in Chalmers5 & Sismondi6 & though you have
commented on it & popularized it I do not think you have added anything
to its substance. The only new point you have made against me is in p.
577 where you say that the fall of profits cannot arise from the
increasing pressure on the fertility of the land inasmuch as that
pressure has for some years been more than counteracted by agricultural
improvements while yet there have been all the signs of diminution of
profits. To this I should answer that I do not think there has in the
last dozen years been any diminution of profits, but only of interest.
If I had had your book some weeks sooner I should probably have added a
few pages to the corresponding chapter of the new edition of mine:8 It
is now too late to do so in this edition.

I could mention several serious differences between us on incidental
points—as where you speak of Malthus’ population theory as “tottering”,9
where you express your fears of some great moral change for the worse in
the English character from the gold discoveries10 as though it were now
something Edition: current; Page: [92] worthy & respectable, noble &
elevated, while to me it seems that almost any change would be for the
better, & especially where you say that pol. ec. unless baptized into
Xtianity is a child of the devil11 which is quite inconsistent with any
good opinion of me & my writings for in my opinion what is called
Xtianity is as thoroughly a child of the devil as any extant—but I have
no time to enter into these things nor would there be room for them in a
letter. I am heartily glad that you have recommenced writing & I hope to
see you again rendering that important service in the diffusion of
valuable thoughts & sentiments which no one now writing for the
periodical press is so much disposed or so well qualified to render.

TO JOHN LALOR1

July 3. 1852

Dear Sir—

My objection to the passage relating to Chalmers2 did not turn as you
seem to suppose, on the word “baptism”. My remarks did not apply
Edition: current; Page: [93] to the phraseology, but to the meaning of
the sentence—to the assertion that pol. ec. unless connected with
Xtianity is “a true child of the devil.” Any reader would suppose that
by Xtianity was here meant belief in the Bible and on your own
interpretation I must still protest against the statement that Chalmers
“began” the baptism in question. I do not know any pol. economist except
perhaps M’Culloch3 to whom the accusation you bring against all who
preceded Chalmers can be attributed even by the license of caricature—&
I especially reject it with respect to A. Smith, Turgot, Say, Ricardo4 &
my father not one of whom was a believer in Xtianity & none of whom
regarded pol. ec. as anything but a subordinate though necessary branch
of utility or as you prefer to term it “the doctrine of human welfare.”5

No men ever wrote to whom the charge of seeking in pol. ec. or in
anything else a “justification of universal selfishness” or of any
selfishness at all could be applied with less justice, & I cannot, on
this point, accept any compliment at their expense. I confess I do not
see the good that is to be done by swelling the outcry against pol.
economists—or why they should be blamed because people do unjust or
selfish things for the sake of money. I do not know what authority you
have for saying that the clearing of Irish estates was “perpetrated in
the name of pol. economy”6 any more than the clearing of English estates
from the same motives in the time of the Tudors. But I do know that
nearly all the pol. economists supported a poor law in Ireland7 in order
to give the landlords an interest in fighting against the causes of
poverty.

No doubt the opinion you have adopted respecting excess of capital must
lead you to some moral (or immoral) conclusions very much opposed to
those of pol. economists generally, especially the opinion that it is a
virtue instead of a vice to be lavish in public & private expenditures.
In this I can by no means agree with you as I think that some of the
principal causes of the degraded moral state of the middle classes in
this country is their absorption in the effort to make the greatest
possible shew at needless & useless expense.

Respecting the point of pol. economy I do not see how Mr. Tooke’s
doctrine,8 that prices depend on the aggregate of money incomes, at all
helps to prove that increase of capital by saving lowers general prices.
Whether £100 is employed in business or in personal expenditure it
equally becomes part of somebody’s money income. Increase of production
will not, I conceive, lower prices unless the production of money is an
exception to Edition: current; Page: [94] the general increase. If it is
so prices will fall, no doubt, but even then the fall of prices or what
is the same thing, the increased value of money does not lower profits
or incumber the markets with unsold goods: it only increases the burthen
of all fixed money engagements. Neither do I believe that the time
immediately preceding the fits of speculation which leads to a
commercial crisis, is distinguished as on your theory it should be by a
general fall of prices.

I will only add that the essay to which you make a complimentary
allusion in p. 129 though written in 1830 was not published till 18369
so that your speaking of it as if it had been known & accessible in 1829
or 1830 gives an erroneous impression which I should much like to see
corrected.

Dear Sir—

Your letter of 5th April has remained very long unanswered, but you are
too well acquainted with the inevitable demands on time produced by the
combination of literary & official employment, to need any other
explanation of my silence. I regret that I am not able to give you the
information you desire respecting cooperative associations in England.2
You appear however to be in communication with some of those who have
taken part in the very insignificant attempts of the kind as yet made in
this country, & they can doubtless tell you all that is to be told. Much
could not be done while the law of partnership3 remained what it was up
to a few days Edition: current; Page: [95] ago.4 According to that
absurd law, the managing members of an association being joint owners of
its funds could not steal or embezzle what was partly their own, & could
not be made criminally responsible for any malversation; & the only
civil tribunal which could determine disputes among partners was the
Court of Chancery. You doubtless know enough of England to understand
that the word Chancery is a name for litigation without end & expense
without limits. In the Session of Parliament just closed an act has been
passed, called the Industrial & Provident Partnerships Act,5 by which
cooperative associations will in future be able to obtain a
comparatively cheap & easy decision of differences & this removes a
great obstacle to their formation & success. It will now be seen whether
any considerable number of the English working people have the intellect
and the love of independence to desire to be their own masters, and the
sense of justice & honor which will fit them for being so. I am sorry to
say my expectations at present are not sanguine. I do not believe that
England is nearly as ripe as most of the Continental countries for this
great improvement. The ownership of the instruments of labour by the
labourers, can only be introduced by people who will make great
temporary sacrifices such as can only be inspired by a generous feeling
for the public good, or a disinterested devotion to an idea, not by the
mere desire of more pay & less work. And the English of all classes are
far less accessible to any large idea or generous sentiment than either
Germans, French or Italians. They are so ignorant too as to pride
themselves on their defect as if it were a virtue, & give it
complimentary names, such as good sense, sobriety, practicalness, which
are common synonyms for selfishness, shortsightedness, & contented
acquiescence in commonplace. In France the success of the associations
has been remarkable,6 & held out the brightest prospect for the
emancipation of the working classes; but these societies are likely to
share the fate of all other freedom & progress under the present
military despotism.7 Many of the associations Edition: current; Page:
[96] have already been suppressed & the remainder, it is said, are
preparing to emigrate.

My wife & I regretted that we were absent from home when your daughter
was staying in the neighbourhood of London, & were therefore unable to
have the pleasure of calling on her. There are two or three subjects
touched on in your letter on which I should be glad to say something if
time permitted. But I have so much to do & so many letters to write that
I must beg you to excuse me for stopping short. I am Dear Sir

My dearest Wife

Though I am persuaded it is unnecessary for any practical purpose, it
will be satisfactory to me to put into writing the explanation of an
accidental circumstance connected with the registry of our marriage at
the Superintendant Registrar’s Office at Weymouth on the 21st of April
1851.—Our marriage by the Registrar Mr Richards was perfectly regular,
and was attested as such by Mr Richards and by the Superintendant
Registrar Mr Dodson, in the presence of both of whom, as well as of the
two witnesses, we signed the register. But I was not aware that it was
necessary to sign my name at full length, thinking that as in most other
legal documents, the proper signature was the ordinary one of the person
signing; and my ordinary signature being J. S. Mill, I at first signed
in that manner; but on being told by the Registrar that the name must be
written at full length, I did the only thing which occurred to me and
what I believe the Registrar suggested, that is, I filled in the
remaining letters of my name. As there was not sufficient space for
them, they were not only written very small and close, but not exactly
in a line with the initials and surname, and the signature consequently
has an unusual appearance. The reason must be at once apparent to any
one who sees it, as it is obvious that J. S. Mill was written first, and
the remainder filled in afterwards. It is almost superfluous to say that
this is not stated for your information—you being as well aware of it as
myself, but in order that there may be a statement in existence of the
manner in which the signature came to present this unusual appearance.
It cannot possibly affect the legality of our marriage, which I have not
the smallest doubt is as regular and valid as any marriage can be: but
so long as it is possible that any doubt could for a moment suggest
itself either to our own or to any other minds, I cannot feel at ease,
and therefore, unpleasant as I know it must be to you, Edition: current;
Page: [97] I do beg you to let us even now be married again,2 and this
time at church, so that hereafter no shadow of a doubt on the subject
can ever arise. The process is no doubt disagreeable, but I have thought
much and anxiously about it, and I have quite made up my mind that
however annoying the fact, it is better to undergo the annoyance than to
let the matter remain as it is. Therefore I hope you will comply with my
earnest wish—and the sooner it is done the better.

The tables appended to the inclosed official memorandum from the
Statistical Department of the India House contain the best information
we can give on the three points on which you made inquiries. As I
expected the balance of trade against India is much greater than the
million & a half you mentioned—but the explanation is, the remittances
for the £800,000 dividends on India stock, the expense of the home
establishments, furlough allowances, pensions, stores sent from this
country &c. You will see that this “tribute” paid by India does not
drain India of the precious metals, as the imports of them into India
vastly exceed the exports. About the trade with Persia we know nothing
except so far as it passes through Bombay—as probably most of it does.

TO LORD MONTEAGLE1

20 March 1853

Dear Lord Monteagle—

The suggestion in the paper2 you sent me is intended to meet a
difficulty which has always appeared to me one of the Edition: current;
Page: [102] chief stumbling blocks of representative government.3
Whoever could devise a means of preventing minorities from being, as
they now are, swamped, and enabling them to obtain a share of the
representation proportional to their numbers and not more than
proportional, would render a great service.4 Whether the plan proposed
would do this, and to what objections it may be liable, I should be
sorry to be obliged to say without more consideration than I have yet
given to it. One thing seems to me evident: that if this plan were
adopted, no constituency ought to elect fewer than three members. For if
the number be two, as the proposed plan would enable a minority to count
for double its number, any minority exceeding one third could ensure
half the representation; which, unless the minority can be presumed to
consist of wiser or better persons than the majority, would be contrary
to all principle.

One very strong recommendation of the plan of cumulative votes5 occurs
to me, which is not mentioned in the Memorandum. If we suppose a voter
to determine his vote by the personal merits of the candidates, and not
solely by their being on the same side with himself in the common party
divisions, it will frequently happen that he greatly prefers one of the
candidates, and is comparatively indifferent to all the others, so that
he would, if he could, give all his votes to that one. This wish is most
likely to be felt by the best voters, and in favour of the best
candidates, and it seems to me right that strength of preference should
have some influence as well as the mere number of persons preferring. To
allow the cumulative vote would be one of the best ways which occur to
me of enabling quality of support to count as well as quantity. The
candidates most likely to benefit by it would be those who were too good
for the mass of the constituency; those for example, whose election was
endangered by some honest but unpopular vote or opinion, and who for
that very reason would probably be supported with redoubled zeal by the
better minority, and their election made the first object.

I do not see the force of your objection respecting bribery. No doubt if
a candidate depended solely on bribed votes, he would find it easier to
succeed Edition: current; Page: [103] if every bribed voter could give
two or three votes for him instead of one. But to carry an election by
bribing everybody is only possible with smaller constituencies than
ought to exist. In large or even moderate constituencies, the bribed are
only the two or three hundred who in a nearly balanced state of parties
turn the scale. Now in this case the minority can get no corrupt
advantage from the cumulative vote unless they limit their aim to a part
of the representation; and if they do this, the cumulative vote may
probably enable them to attain their object without bribing. Thus, if
there are two members to be returned, and the minority will be content
with returning one, a minority exceeding a third would have no
inducement to bribe, but only a minority of less than a third. At
present the reverse is the case: a minority of less than a third has no
chance of succeeding by bribery, while a minority of more than a third
has. The cumulative vote therefore displaces, but does not seem to me to
increase, the inducement to bribe.

The point is well worth consideration in framing a new Reform Bill,6
which, to be any real improvement, ought not to be a mere imitation and
extension of the Reform Bill of 1832. There are, as it seems to me,
three great and perfectly safe improvements, which could hardly be
successfully resisted if a Government proposed them. One is to have no
small constituencies: this might be done by grouping the small towns
into districts. Another is to let in the principle of an educational
qualification, by requiring from all voters, in addition to any property
or ratepaying conditions that may be imposed, at least reading, writing,
and arithmetic. The third is to open the franchise to women who fulfil
the same conditions on which it is granted to men; in the same manner as
they already vote for boards of guardians. They have as much interest in
good laws as men have, and would vote at least as well. Electoral
districts seem to me needless, and ballot would now be a step backward
instead of forward.7

I beg to apologise for not having answered sooner, but I did not like to
give an opinion without consideration, and being pressed for time I was
not able before to give the subject even the degree of consideration
which I have now done.—I am, dear Lord Monteagle, very truly yours,

Dear Sir

I am obliged to you for your propositions with respect to publishing
either notes to the Analysis, or my contributions to reviews,2 but in
the first place I am engaged on a new work of my own,3 so that I have
not time to spare, and if I had, I should hardly like to publish
anything without first offering it to Mr Parker with whom I have been so
many years connected as publisher.

I do not think it will be worth while to write anything on the politics
of the day at the end of the session. The doings of the session, though
useful, have been on too small a scale to afford subjects, and the two
principal topics, the financial measures and the India question, will be
decided and the interest gone, before the next publication of the
review. For large views on any subject there is daily less and less
public in this country.

I shall be happy to review the last three volumes of Mr Grote’s
History.2 I had engaged to review the 9th and 10th volumes for Mr Empson
but finding that they hardly afforded sufficient material, I had agreed
with him to put off writing until the volume now published could be
included. I think with you that there is now matter enough for an
article, though more might have been made of the subject if there had
been a greater amount of dissertation and discussion in the volumes. I
am glad you will not want the article for the July number.

TO SIR WILLIAM MOLESWORTH1

I[ndia] H[ouse]

15 May [1853]

Dear Molesworth—

My opinions on these subjects are very much the same with yours except
where they are mixed up with other subjects. I conceive that in the
present state of the distribution of wealth in this country any
additional land brought into the market is likely to be bought by rich
people & not by poor. The present question however does not turn upon
whether partition is an evil or a good2—but upon whether to save the
owner of a landed estate from the necessity of selling part of it (in
this case a very small part) he ought to be exempted from paying his
fair share of the taxes.3 This is so impudent a pretension that it
hardly admits of any more complete exposure than is made by the simplest
statement. The reason would seem just as well for dispensing them from
paying any taxes whatever, or from paying their debts, for they may be
unable to do either of these without selling their land. If the
inheritors of land wish to keep it entire let them save the tax out of
their income. Gladstone allows them several years to do it in.4 No large
proprietor ought to have any difficulty in this, except those who are
deeply mortgaged, & the sooner they can be induced to sell, the better.
That is a proposition which may be very safely assumed in these days.

I do not know any writers who have discussed taxes on succession at much
length, except some of the French Socialists,5 & they (besides that they
are bad political economists) derive their arguments from premises not
suited to the atmosphere of the H. o. C.

I think that when the India Bill2 has passed which it virtually has
already, the time will be gone by for an article on the form of
government. All questions respecting the form of government will be
closed for some years to come & it seems to me that nothing practical
can come of any writing on the subject—& there are very few readers who
would be interested in the mere theory. What I should write on India at
present would be only, or chiefly, on the administrative part of the
subject. I should try to correct the ignorant and dishonest
misrepresentations of the present mode of governing India, & at the same
time to point out how it may be improved. I could write such an article
for the Edinburgh if you would like to have it—but not in time for the
January number.

Aug. 7 [1853]

My Lord—

Allow me to thank you for a copy of your pamphlet on the Law of
Partnership.2 Such subjects are not often discussed with so much
closeness of reasoning & precision of expression; & it is still more
rare to find the question of justice separated from that of expediency &
made paramount Edition: current; Page: [107] to it. I prefer to say
“justice” rather than, in your words “natural justice”, both because
Nature is often grossly unjust & because I do not think that the first
spontaneous sentiment of justice always agrees with that which is the
result of enlightened reflexion.

As you do me the honor to ask my opinion of your argument, I think that
as much of it as is in defence of the commandite principle is sound, &
conclusively stated. But you have not convinced me that either justice
or expediency requires the unlimited liability of all who take part in
the management, or in other words that there ought to be no compagnies
anonymes.3 Justice, it appears to me, is fully satisfied if those who
become creditors of the partnership know beforehand that they will have
no claim beyond the amount of the subscribed capital. The points of
additional information mentioned in pages 5 & 7 & which you say cannot
be possessed by the public, do not seem to me required in justice, even
if they were in point of expediency. Volenti non fit injuria: if a
person chooses to lend either to an individual or a company knowing that
the borrowers only pledge a certain sum & not their whole property for
the debt, I cannot see that there is any injustice done merely because
the lender cannot watch that certain sum & know at all times where it is
& what is being done with it. I differ from you also though with
somewhat less confidence on the question of expending. I do not doubt
that the unlimited liability of railway directors would be some
additional security for prudent management, but the additional security
would I think be too dearly purchased by the renunciation of all power
in the shareholders to control the directors or to change them. The
publicity afforded by the periodical meetings of shareholders, by the
necessity of laying before them the entire state of the concern & their
power of verifying the statements, seems to me a far greater protection
to the public as well as to shareholders than the liability of the
directors to the full extent of their property especially considering
how imperfect a check to rash speculation this is in private
transactions.

My own dearest one! how cold the old place looked & felt when I returned
to it2—I sat in the room usually warmed by her presence, & in the usual
place, & looked at her vacant chair, wishing for the time when it will
be again filled, & for the time, much sooner than that, when I shall see
her dear handwriting—which is the pleasure of absence. I went to bed
very early, after studying the big Physiology3 nearly all the evening.

It rained torrents in the night & in the morning Kate4 knocked at the
door & said that the water had come in again—it had indeed, in at least
a dozen places, reaching as far as the beau milieu of the room, so there
is another plastering job inevitable—& it was every way unlucky as there
was no getting at the place to bale out the water, which lay apparently
so deep that no doubt the pipe was stopt up. There was nothing to be
done but to go again to Smith’s & say that the place he had mended was
worse than before—Again unluckily the old fellow was out, & not expected
for a day or two but his son promised to go immediately, & take a
ladder. It is very disagreeable having any workman there with nobody in
the house, but it could not be helped.

I sent the article to Lewis5 today after revising it on all points. I
have cut the knot of “the grandest passage” by making it “the most
celebrated” & have altered the two “greatests” to greatest commonwealth
& most distinguished citizen—in the other. The “political education”
place which I said I Edition: current; Page: [109] would try to
strengthen in ideas instead of in words, I have done so—I hope the proof
will come in time for full consideration—& now dearest dearest angel
adieu till tomorrow when I shall write again & perhaps shall have had
the happiness of a word, though I will not let myself count upon it.

Ah my own dearest, if you knew the pleasure your precious letter would
give, you would not think there needed a “better” tomorrow. How sweet of
her in all the bustle & fatigue of arriving & the bother of not finding
lodgings to write such a darling letter. I almost hope you have gone on
to Teignmouth as there was nothing to be had facing the sea. As for me
the whole time seems passed in waiting for her—but it will not be so
during the longer absence for I shall have some steady job of writing to
begin & finish which will prevent the time from seeming long & for
amusement I have a scheme for looking over the plants.2 I shall look for
some tomorrow if the weather lets me go out. It rained very much last
night but it has not yet rained today. The time does not hang heavy
darling, for I have always her to think of, & our nice home has now
begun to recall her presence instead of only her absence. As for health
I was not quite so well the last day or two as the three or four days
before, but I have been better again this morning. Like all my former
little ailments this sticks very close & varies very much from day to
day.3 I shall be quite content if it goes off within a year. Meanwhile
your dear love & kindness would make it quite a pleasure being unwell if
only you would not be anxious my dearest dearest angel. I have seen
nobody except Grote who called yesterday but have had a note from
Adderley4 which I inclose with the answer I propose sending when dearest
one has made it right. The men came yesterday but, Kate5 says, only
staid about 10 minutes during which they cleared the pipe & “hammered
down something.” The water has not come in since.6 Adieu with a thousand
loves. If it is fine tomorrow & she gets this in time she can think of
him somewhere about Reigate & Dorking.7

My own precious darling wife what sweet words! what good it did & does
me to read that one word—she knows which—the sweetest word she can
say—when she can say or write that, I know how she must be loving me &
feeling all that it is happiest to think of & all that I most wish for.
I needed it too, for words of love in absence are as they always were,
what keeps the blood going in the veins—but for them whenever I am not
anxious & triste à mourir for fear she should not be loving me, I should
have only a sort of hybernating existence like those animals found in
the inside of a rock. But her dear darling letters are only a less good
than her still sweeter presence & voice & looks & spoken words. The time
does not seem long & is now very nearly half over.

I wrote on Saturday & directed exactly as before—it is vexatious that
she should not have received it on Sunday morning—I hope the reason was
some of their Sunday nonsense & that she did not suppose I had not
written.

I had a good walk yesterday—it was a fine bright day with a few short
showers only two of which were at all heavy & an umbrella & a hedge
sheltered me completely from those. I went to Reigate by the railway,
then walked six hours with a good deal of climbing & after having tea &
a leg & wing of cold chicken at Dorking felt quite able & inclined to
walk to Betchworth between four & five miles more. There I took the
railway, & walking across our heath home was hardly more tired than I
often am in coming home from the office. I feel no worse for it as to
the ailment & much the better for it otherwise. I saw the country well &
it looked very beautiful but somehow our daily view seemed much
pleasanter. I saw the comet too2—it was like a reddish streak, much
brightest at the lower end, as bright as Edition: current; Page: [111] a
large star but without so definite an outline—the redness I suppose was
because it was in twilight & near the horizon, like the red colour of
the moon when newly risen! I hope you have seen or will see it, but it
must be looked for much earlier than we did. I saw it before half past
eight & it was then near setting. As it is going towards the sun, it
sets every evening earlier after sunset & at last will be quite lost in
the sun’s rays.

The note inclosed came on Saturday evening. The other from Henry Solly3
seems to me very impudent, putting together what it does not contain
with what it does.

This is the first time since we were married my darling wife that we
have been separated & I do not like it at all—but your letters are the
greatest delight & as soon as I have done reading one I begin thinking
how soon I shall have another. Next to her letters the greatest pleasure
I have is writing to her. I have written every day since Friday except
the day there was no post—I am glad the cause of your not getting
Saturday’s letter was the one I guessed & that you did get it at last.
This time I have absolutely nothing to tell except my thoughts, & those
are wholly of you—As for occupation, after I get home I read as long as
I can at the thick book3—yesterday evening I fairly fell asleep over it,
but I shall read it to the end, for I always like to get at the latest
generalizations on any scientific subject & that in particular is a most
rapidly progressive subject just at present & is so closely connected
with the subjects of mind & feeling that there is always a chance of
something practically useful turning up. I am very much inclined to take
the Essay on Nature4 again in hand & rewrite it as thoroughly as I did
the review of Grote5—that is what it wants—it is my old way of working &
I do not think I have ever done anything well which was not done in that
way. I am almost sorry for the Edition: current; Page: [112] engagement
with Lewis about India6 as I think it would have been a much better
employment of the time to have gone on with some more of our Essays. We
must finish the best we have got to say, & not only that, but publish it
while we are alive—I do not see what living depositary there is likely
to be of our thoughts, or who in this weak generation that is growing up
will even be capable of thoroughly mastering & assimilating your ideas,
much less of reoriginating them—so we must write them & print them, &
then they can wait till there are again thinkers. But I shall never be
satisfied unless you allow our best book,7 the book which is to come, to
have our two names in the title page. It ought to be so with everything
I publish, for the better half of it all is yours, but the book which
will contain our best thoughts, if it has only one name to it, that
should be yours. I should like every one to know that I am the Dumont8 &
you the originating mind, the Bentham, bless her!

I hope the weather has improved as much with you as it has here—but it
does not look settled yet. With all loving thoughts & wishes

My dearest angel! she will have got this morning the letter I wrote
yesterday after receiving hers. I am so sorry she should have had the
teaze she mentions—it would have been so much better—knowing ce que
c’est que ce monde-là & having forgotten to ask you the question, to
have done exactly as usual.

Dieu merci the time of absence is nearly over now. The only new thing
here is that on Monday evening, (the first time I went into the back
garden,) I found the ground strewed with a good deal more than half of
all the pears in the garden. Next morning I told Kate to pick them up
but she said she had already done it. In the case of the only two trees
where the pears were nearly or quite ripe, they were most of them half
eaten, I suppose by birds. It is seldom such stormy weather in the fruit
time as this year—but it has been tolerably fine for some days now—I
have been hoping that you had the same benefit.

Edition: current; Page: [113]
I went to Coulson2 this morning who finding me no better for the
colchicum (though no worse) & not thinking that the symptoms are those
of congestion or anything of that sort, was fairly puzzled & proposed to
me to go with him tomorrow afternoon to Dr Golding Bird,3 as he did
before to Prout4—or rather I should say proposed to me to meet him
there. I hope the result will be as successful as it was with Prout—at
all events we shall have two opinions.

I am glad that you are so well pleased with the article on Grote.2 More
might certainly have been said about the Sicilian history, & the
Anabasis, but as those parts of the history do not illustrate anything
very important, I proposed passing rapidly to those which did. I would
however have given the quintessence of the chapter on Dion if it had
been possible to do it in any moderate space.

You will see what I have done in consequence of your various
suggestions. As you say, the tendency of [the] Athenian alliance must
have been to favor democracy, but Grote has pointed out several
instances in which one is surprised to find important members of the
alliance under the government of oligarchies.3 I have made a little
alteration in the paragraph about Greek slavery,4 but it might look too
much like an apology for slavery.

I shall be very happy to look at the article5 you mention if you are
able to send it at latest on Thursday, as we are going to the Continent

The article2 you sent seems to me very good. The writer evidently knows
his subject, has taken pains to be right, & his praise & blame are in
the right places. If it is read as I hope it may be by those who can
influence matters at Madras, it is likely to do much good. As to its
interfering with what I may write, there are only about two pages which
could possibly do so, those in which the writer comments on the ryotwar
system,3 in a manner from which I partly dissent but I do not think this
any reason for omitting them as some difference of opinion between
different articles seems to me to be even desirable.

My darling love

I am writing this in the warm salle à manger of the Hotel Bristol after
a northern wintry day, not par façon de parler but literally, for the
ponds were frozen hard all the way, & the little waterfalls by the road
side not only hung with icicles but were encrusted with ice so as to
seem frozen bodily—However I did not suffer from cold thanks to the
wrapper & your dear kindness. Edition: current; Page: [115] As far as
Toulon I did very well, I had the coupé & an educated Frenchman in it
though looking below the gentleman class as so many of them do—he was
d’un certain âge—we talked history, literature & at last politics,
ending with the present state of things about which we perfectly
agreed—he had some sense & some liberality. We got to Toulon about 10 &
I had two hours to walk about—it is a cheerful rather busy town but was
soon seen & the keen wind drove me at last into a café for the sake of
fire. The two inns praised by Plana2 & Murray, the Croix d’or & de
Malte,3 are close together in the little Place des [Foires2] which like
all the other Places is planted with plane trees, which must be very
agreeable in summer. From Toulon to Marseille there was no coupé to be
had & I was in a full interior with four women superabounding in clothes
which & the smallness of the diligence made me excessively cramped &
uncomfortable during the seven hours we passed on the road of which
however half an hour was spent in stopping to help another diligence
which had broken a spring—a private carriage also stopped & parted with
its fresh horses taking tired ones to help the carriage on. I was struck
as one often is with the really fraternal & Christian feeling of the
French on such occasions. The four women looked about the class of Mme
Goutant4 but two of them had pillows edged with lace & all took immense
pains to be comfortable—Happily they had talk enough with one another so
that my silence did not look like the ill manners of ces anglais. You
see dear I am writing like a dull & tired person but it is convenient to
begin my letter now & I shall finish it & put it in the post at Arles
where I shall have a pretty long stay—I shall go by the train which
leaves here at 9 & gets to Arles at 11 & shall leave again at ½ past 3
to arrive at Avignon at 5. This seems a good inn as far as I can judge—I
shall be able to say more tomorrow. I sat in the cramped diligence
thinking of every ill that could happen to my precious one, but I have
got over the black vision now. I saw Lily5 at the window & hope she saw
me shake about a handkerchief. Mme Suzanne tried to make me pay 3 f. a
night but when I objected gave it up readily saying I had parfaitement
raison—this seems her way—to try it on & take it off quick if it does
not fit. I remembered in the carriage that I had not asked a very
essential question about Kate6 viz. how she has been provided with money
hitherto whether by money left with her (& if so, how much) or given by
Haji. Did you ever read a letter so unlike me, but you will be glad to
have any news of me & you will like me to write feeling comfortable,
alone by a good fire. The pen & ink do credit to the name of Bristol. I
have just been reading Edition: current; Page: [116] Galignani7 which
talks of excessively cold weather in England—Palmerston’s successor8 is
not appointed but it is said that Graham is to succeed him & Fox Maule9
to take the Admiralty in the room of Graham. The papers are attacking Ld
Aberdeen10 for want of spirit about Turkey11 & it is reported that Louis
Napoleon has called on the English Govt to know its mind & say what that
mind is.

Thursday 1 oclock. I am now writing in a much queerer place, the salle à
manger of the Hotel du Forum at Arles with people dining all round me—I
shall imitate them presently. The Bristol is dear—including service I
paid 10 fr for bed, supper (tea, bifteck & potatoes) & breakfast. It is
a very quiet place & the people civil, prompt & unobtrusive but the
apartments begin up two flights of stairs, the entresol being wholly
occupied by the salle à manger & the people who keep the house. This
would be fatal if it were not very likely that the case is the same at
the other inns. The stairs however are very easy. I came here by railway
in two hours & have just done seeing this strange old place with its
curious old cathedral & its ugly Roman amphitheatre—curious because so
very perfect & making one see so exactly how those old rascals managed
their savage exhibitions. It is still bitterly cold & the people here &
at Marseilles seem to feel it as much as I do. One said “Il ne fera pas
plus froid au Nord”. It is one satisfaction that I now know the winter
travelling will not hurt me. My cough is if anything better. I think the
chief thing which is amiss with me is what Gurney12 said, the action of
the heart—it goes gallop, gallop, & flutter, flutter, especially in bed,
though I have been only one day without taking the digitalis which was
intended expressly against that. I have not cared much about the scenery
as I came along—when at its best it is much like what we have seen & I
feel sated with it. I think I never wrote her so long a letter so little
worth reading but I write what comes first & what I have to tell. She
knows under it all there is the deepest & strongest & truest love. Bless
her, only good of my life.

I owe the having time to write today to my dearest one, to not having
been able to get a place—You know how often in France one has to pass
the day at an inn & travel at night—it is so with me now. When I got
here at 7 yesterday (the train having kept me waiting at Arles an hour &
a half beyond its time) I found no possibility of getting on this
morning & the only certain place at all a coupé place at 5 this evening.
I am promised to get to Lyons in 24 hours—I do not know by how many
hours the promise will be broken—those who arrived from Lyons this
morning had snow almost all the way & were many hours behind time. A
traveller who arrived from Montpellier last evg says the thermometer
there is 7 degrees (16 of Fahrenheit) below freezing & that snow is a
foot deep in the streets of Beziers. There cannot be more wintry weather
for travelling & all my wish is to get through it as fast as possible. I
have given up the Meulins project unless I find when at Lyons that it is
the shortest way, which may well be as the steamboats on the Saône are
stopped by the ice & there is therefore little likelihood of a place by
the diligence to Chàlon for some days—you see I may be detained a long
while at Lyons. I have performed the painful duty of seeing this town in
a really terrible north wind which roared all night most tempestuously.
I was surprised at the great size of the place. The cathedral & still
more its position, the buildings adjoining &c are well worth seeing—I
had another motive for going out which was to buy something to put on my
head at night for the hat is terribly in the way. I bought a decent
cloth travelling cap. This inn (l’Europe) seems good, it has plenty of
rooms au premier & an easy staircase, of the eating I only know a very
good sweet omlet & excellent tea (as at Marseilles) besides good coffee
& excellent butter which was the only thing bad at Marseilles the people
saying in excuse that there is no good butter in the place. My
occupation here is reading newspapers, especially Galignani of which the
last received announces Palmerston’s reacceptance of office2—of course
he has been bought by the sacrifice of whatever in the reform bill he
objected to. The bill is sure to be something poor & insignificant. The
Edition: current; Page: [118] Daily News3 & Examiner4 are attacking
Albert for interfering in politics. He seems to be generally blamed for
the temporizing inefficient conduct of the ministry about Turkey5 & is
supposed to be Austrian in disposition since the Belgian
marriage6—probably mere gossip & scandal of which there is always as
much going in courts as elsewhere. How I long to know how my darling
is—how delighted I shall be to get to Boulogne—but how long it may be
first it is difficult to tell. I owe an apology to Hyères for they say
this cold has lasted 8 or 10 days so that Hyères is really,
comparatively, mild. If I am detained at Lyons I will write from there.
Adieu my perfect one. A thousand loves & blessings & kisses—How I long
for the first sight of that dear handwriting. What a pleasure to think
she is not cold. But for the wrapper her kindness provided I should have
been frozen & now my darling life, adieu with a myriad of blessings.

[P.S.] I hope the Spectator which I sent yesterday will arrive.

I forgot to mention before, that Notes & Queries7 are all complete.

I fill my letters with nothing but the chances & mischances of this
journey—but I know they are interesting to my dearest one & I shall
write better letters when I am quiet at home. Home! how completely home
it is even in her absence—but how completely also the place where she is
& which I am so happy to have seen & to know, is home too—I am looking
with the mind’s eye across that Place des Palmiers which cold as I used
to think it, seems almost summer to me now—& seeing that beautiful
prospect instead of these tame snowcovered fields. But I will take up
the history where I left it—The diligence by which I took my place from
Avignon & which was called Messageries Françaises des maîtres de poste,
left a little after five, & after four changes of carriage, at
Montelimart,2 Valence, Vienne & Givors (the last piece was part of the
St. Etienne railway) brought me to Lyons almost frozen at ten on
Saturday. I was in despair about getting on, as it was so late to go
about finding offices in that large place & I had heard all the way of
the impossibility of getting places to Châlon & the fabulous prices paid
for them, so I thought myself lucky in being offered a place for 7h the
next morning—I made it secure & then went to the Univers & on New Year’s
morning made my way in the dark to the office just opposite the place
where we landed—They promised I should arrive in 12 hours, or as there
was snow perhaps in 14. The carriage turned out to be an omnibus with 8
places which generally goes between Lyons & Villefranche a place about a
quarter of the way but which since the steamboats have been stopped,
takes passengers to Châlon. It made me pay 25 fr. though others I found
were only charged 18 & 20 fr. At the time at which we ought to have been
at Châlon we were only at Mâcon where we were kept 3 hours on pretext of
waiting for another carriage. I had promised myself a night’s sleep at
Châlon, & to leave this morning by the first train & go on by a night
train to Boulogne, so saving a day: but we arrived here at 7 this
morning when the train was gone & there is no other but the express at
1¾ so I must pass a useless night at Paris. This delay was only Edition:
current; Page: [120] partly owing to the snow of which up to Mâcon there
was not very much & only a little of the delay was owing to the driver’s
knocking against a stone hidden as he said by the snow & breaking the
pole of the carriage (at 11 at night): for this only caused about 1½
hour of the twelve hours’ delay. The whole concern is a piece of knavery
as those small diligence concerns are apt to be. There were one or two
agreeable men especially one Frenchman & a young Savoyard in the crowded
little omnibus which made the whole affair a little less tiresome &
provoking. I am now at the trois faisans & shall make them shew me their
bed rooms in case you like to come there in spring. The inn at Avignon,
l’Europe, was cheap as well as good—only the table d’hôte is dear,
having an inscription that on account of the énorme increase of the
price of wine & of la plupart des vivres the table d’hôte must be raised
to 3½ f. except for diligence travellers who have never time to do more
than diner à la hôte (considerate).

Adieu till Boulogne darling.

My adored one will know without my telling her, how the very instant
after I arrived here I rushed through the sloppy melting snow to the
post office tormenting myself all the way lest the man should pretend
there was no letter. When I got the darling word how I devoured it & how
happy & in spirits I was made by the good news of her health & the
exquisite proofs of her love that its most precious words contained. But
it disappointed me that she had not yet received my first letter, which
I put into the post at Arles on Thursday afternoon: which would reach
Marseille that evening & I hoped would go to Hyères that night so that
she would get it before she wrote—I pleased myself with the thought that
she would have a letter sooner than she expected & that her first would
tell me she had received it. However no doubt it came right; as it was
independent of the man at the post office, having been directed in the
same manner as this, which has also been the case with the two I have
since written, from Avignon & Châlon; & will be the case with all I
write. To go on with my adventures: the Trois Faisans is a second rate
inn apparently but has one very large & good salon au premier & plenty
of tolerable though not very large bedrooms. I did not go to bed but
went on by the train at ½ past 1 & got to Paris very nicely & Edition:
current; Page: [121] comfortably the carriages being warmed. I arrived
at past 12 at Lawson’s Bedford Hotel, which is close to the Victoria &
can almost be seen from it, being the fourth or fifth house in the Rue
de l’Arcade, the street which turns off at the fruitshop. It seems a
good inn & not dear, & at least to voyageurs who sit in what the waiter
called le coffee room. I saw a very nice set of rooms au second & was
told they were the like au troisième, those on the premier which must
have been if anything better were let avec cuisine which the landlady
said she only does in winter. The house looks about as large outwardly
as the Victoria, not larger. One recommendation is that it has an
omnibus of its own to the northern railroad. As I arrived so late & had
not had the night I expected at Châlon, I thought I would give myself a
long night at Paris, & not attempt to go by the 9 o’clock train, but
wait till the next at one o’clock which I found would do very well as
the steamboat next day (Wednesday) did not go till half past one—& I
thought now my troubles were over, but the worst was to come & my
experience of winter travelling was to be completed by being snowed up
for near 24 hours on a railway. We got in pretty good time to Amiens but
came to a halt between it & Abbeville—Seven hours we remained on the
line while messages were sent to Abbeville & Amiens for another
engine—but none came, from the first because there were none there, from
the second for some reason I could get no explanation of. At last they
got up the steam again & took on the train by half at a time to
Abbeville where it was declared we must halt till the road was cleared.
I & a few others got into an omnibus & went to the town & I sat by the
kitchen fire of the hotel du Commerce from ½ past 3 till daylight when
we were sent for by a blunder of the railway people who first told us we
could now go, & then when we were seated in the carriages, that we could
not, so there all the passengers remained unable to leave the waiting
room because told that we might go at any minute till half past two
yesterday afternoon. The bore was immense, the passengers being more
than half of them English & Americans, the most vulgar & illiterate—&
the one or two English & French that were better kept aloof like me & we
did not find each other out. I found two of them at this inn at
Boulogne, an Englishman who it appeared was a coachmaker & a Frenchman
settled in England in some business whose English was quite
undistinguishable from an Englishman’s, & found them rather sensible
people. To the bore of the detention was added another, viz that
somebody went off with my umbrella from the salle d’attente, & I shall
have to buy one here. The lost one was luckily old, having been several
times covered, but I regret it as you darling liked the stick. I came
here to the Hotel Folkestone, one of those on the quai opposite the
landing place, thinking I would try it as it was recommended in
Galignani2 & it seems a very tolerable place, having both salons &
bedrooms Edition: current; Page: [122] on the ground floor & good ones
too though not very large. As for my health which she writes so sweetly
about, I could not expect not to catch fresh cold now & then. I have
been better one day & worse another & am on the whole much the same as
at Hyères. I am still of the same opinion about the chief mischief being
overaction of the heart which is checked but not conquered by the
digitalis I have been taking ever since Avignon—& now heaven bless my
own dearest angel.

[P.S.] I hate this nasty blue ink but can get no other.

How sweetest sweet of the darling to write a second time on Friday after
she received the letter—& how happy it made me to see her letter here on
arriving, among the heap of trumpery [words obliterated] reports &c that
the post had brought here in the 3 months—along with a few letters that
required attending to about which [words obliterated] tomorrow or next
day when I have had more time to look at them. I now write, among what
bustle you can imagine, only to say by the very first post what she was
anxious to know—how I got here. I had a very smooth passage of only two
hours & succeeded in not being sick at all. I got home between 10 & 11 &
had a warm reception from Kate & (for him) from Haji. The ground here is
covered with snow, & where the snow (at Blackheath) has been partly
scraped off or beaten down it is frozen again & very slippery so that
getting to town was some trouble & the streets are sloppy with the half
melted snow so that London looks its ugliest & feels its most
disagreeable. I had not been in my room ten minutes when Hill,2
Thornton3 & various others poured in one after another with their
congratulations & enquiries. There seems to have been a general
impression that I was so ill that there was no knowing when I might come
back (or perhaps if I shd ever come back at all) so that they generally
said I looked better than they expected. Several asked if it was not
imprudent to return at this season & in this weather. Ellice4 received
me with the cordial manner which imposed on me before & which his note
so belied, said he had been Edition: current; Page: [123] uneasy about
me, having heard from Sykes,5 it did not clearly appear what, but he
said he had feared I was worse. I said I had not written again after my
second letter because I hoped every week to be able to come. When I said
I had been harassed by the thought that I was wanted here he said he
would not tell me how much I had been wanted—but I could gather nothing
of whether he had really felt the want of me or not. He as well as Hill,
Thornton & others asked the questions that might be expected about your
health & in a manner which shewed interest. Peacock6 alone asked not a
single question about your health & hardly about mine but struck into
India house subjects & a visit he has had from James.7 Grote & Prescott8
called together today, as they said to enquire if I was returned & were
very warm, especially Grote, in their expressions of sympathy & interest
about your illness. It is odd to see the sort of fragmentary manner in
which news gets about—Grote had heard of you as dangerously ill but not
of my being ill at all, & of your illness as a fever but not of the
rupture of a bloodvessel. Grote is vastly pleased with the article in
the Edinburgh9— & a propos I found here a letter from Mrs Grote, of
complimentation on the article, which though little worthy of the honour
of being sent to you I may as well inclose. The impudence of writing to
me at all & of writing in such a manner is only matched by the excessive
conceit of the letter. Grote alluded to it saying Mrs Grote had written
to me after reading the article—I merely answered that I had found a
note from her on arriving. There is a friendly note from Sykes written
after we left which I will inclose tomorrow when I can send with it a
sketched answer to it—Adieu my most beloved & I shall write soon again.

No letter today darling—but I did not count upon it—& Lily’s to Haji
which arrived on Saty evening gave news of my darling one up to Monday.
I wonder when I shall be able to write her a letter not filled with
petty details. However as the details must be written about, the best
plan is to knock them off as quickly as possible & get rid of them. I
looked over the bills yesterday & found that the quantity of bread which
we thought would be sufficient now, viz a 2 lb loaf every day from
Monday to Friday & a 4 lb on Saty, is exactly what has been taken all
along, including even the time when Haji was away. I asked Kate the
meaning of this & she said she didn’t have potatoes for herself & that
she could not take less than a 2 lb loaf—evidently unsatisfactory—but I
find from Haji that she has had her aunt staying with her the greater
part of the whole time including his absence, which leaves less to be
accounted for. Haji says he told you of this (the aunt) at Nice—perhaps
it is a good thing by preventing the worse things which you feared. The
butter has been pretty regularly a pound of fresh & half pound of salt
each week. My return can hardly increase the pound to 1½ lb. Nothing
else struck me as noticeable but Parsons2 has not sent any bills for a
month owing it is said to Mrs P. having had an accident on the ice—but I
shall make him send them. Should the bills be now paid? The birds are in
fine feather, & Kate says, sing much more & better than at first & eat
immensely. I have answered Marshall3 & Urquhart.4 To M. I said that if
it were still in time which of course it is not, I would have bid him do
with my letter anything he thought useful, only not to imply that I was
a positive supporter of his plan, as it had not yet been sufficiently
discussed to bring out all the objections &c. Urquhart I advised to
publish his paper5 (a very good one) as a pamphlet but offered if he
liked to recommend it to Fraser.6 There was also an application from the
Soc. of Arts7 saying that they have to adjudicate a prize to some work
on jurisprudence & asking me to send them a list of the three best
recently published, in order of merit. I answered acknowledging the
honor Edition: current; Page: [126] but saying I was not sufficiently
acquainted with recent writings on jurisprudence to be a qualified
witness as to their claims to the prize. The Kensington letters8 I
inclose, as it is best you should see all that comes from that quarter—&
along with them, a note I have just written to my mother. I have looked
through the Edinburgh for October—the article on Grote9 reads, to my
mind, slighter & flimsier than I thought it would. There is another
article by Greg10 on Parly reform shewing that he had seen our letter to
Ld Monteagle11 (the one Marshall12 writes about) for he has adopted
nearly every idea in the letter almost in the very words, & has also
said speaking of the ballot, that it is within his knowledge that some
to whom ballot was once a sine qua non, now think it would be “a step
backward” the very phrase of the letter. He goes on to attack the ballot
with arguments some of them so exactly the same as those in our
unpublished pamphlet13 (even to the illustrations) that one would think
he had seen that too if it had been physically possible. Though there
are some bad arguments mixed yet on the whole this diminishes my regret
that ours was not published. It is satisfactory that those letters we
take so much trouble to write for some apparently small purpose, so
often turn out more useful than we expected. Now about reviewing
Comte:14 the reasons pro are evident. Those con are 1st I don’t like to
have anything to do with the name or with any publication of H.
Martineau. 2dly. The Westr though it will allow I dare say anything
else, could not allow me to speak freely about Comte’s atheism & I do
not see how it is possible to be just to him, when there is so much to
attack, without giving him praise on that point of the subject. 3dly, as
Chapman is the publisher he doubtless wishes, & expects, an article more
laudatory on the whole, than I shd be willing to write. You dearest one
will tell me what your perfect judgment & your feeling decide.—My cough
varies from day to day but I have certainly rather more than when I left
Hyères, still however the irritation does not feel as if it came from
the chest. I do not know what to make of the great derangement of the
circulation. My pulse which when I am well is not above 60, is now fully
90, & without any apparent cause, for I have now no signs of the
Edition: current; Page: [127] low fever to which Gurney attributed it—my
stomach & bowels are in good order, my appetite excellent (during the
journey it was immense). I have sent for digitalis from Allen15 but it
is impossible to go on taking that indefinitely & it has only a
temporary effect when any at all. That & the obstinacy of the cough seem
to imply something that keeps up irritation in the system, requiring to
be removed but I don’t know whom to consult—I must see Coulson16 I
suppose, if only because I have not yet paid him, but this is not I
fancy in his line & he would probably refer me to Bird17 who he says has
much practice in chest complaints. Tell me dearest what you think. Au
reste I feel quite well & strong. Several times every day I have longed
to be with her in those little rooms under that light sky instead of
this dismal congregation of vapours—though the snow now is nearly
gone—adieu my own darling for this time. Love to Lily.

No letter yet! The two letters dated on the Friday after I left are all
I have yet had. Surely one must have miscarried, for she cannot have
been eight days without either she or Lily writing even a line—& it does
not seem half so unlikely that a letter from Hyères, as it did that one
from Sidmouth should go astray. I have enquired everywhere at the I.H.
It is of no use writing to Maberly2 till I can tell him on what day the
letter was sent. But indeed I shall care comparatively little about a
former letter when I shall have received any. Not to have heard for so
long fills me with all sorts of anxious misgivings about her health—not
to say that my own spirits are apt to flag without the support of her &
hearing from her—a letter is a support in the same way though it cannot
be in the same degree, as her presence. Did she not see the precious,
the dearly beloved one, during those two or nearer three months, that it
is impossible for me to be really out of spirits when I am seeing her,
living with her? Next to that is the joy & support of a few words of her
handwriting—I am writing this in our pleasant room—pleasant even in her
Edition: current; Page: [128] absence—indeed her presence always seems
to hover over it. My first care after returning was to have everything
in it about which she had spoken, arranged in the manner she wished—my
second look, & almost my first, on the evening of my arrival, was to see
if the chair with its back to the fire was the one that should be—it was
so, & has been ever since, & Haji says, always before. The two chairs
which should be at the ends of the sideboard are there, with the things
tied round them, unchanged. We have moved the table nearer the window,
as she wished; the edge at which I sit at meals is opposite the middle
of the fire. The little book was procured3—I wrote in it for the first
time on Sunday & have written something each evening since—whether what
I have written was much worth writing is another question. Ever since
Sunday I have had meat with tea instead of dining out. It is pleasanter
& subtracts so much from the being out after dark. I was almost
forgetting to say a thing of much more importance, viz. that I today
wrote out and signed that codicil4—the signature is attested by Napier &
Bourdillon.5 Touching my health—the digitalis which I have taken for the
last three days has I think done the cough some little good but has not
reduced the pulse perceptibly. I have pretty well made up my mind to see
Clark6 tomorrow or the day after, as the more I think about it the less
I rely on any of the opinions given by Gurney on the subject, & besides
when an ailment of this sort sticks to one, one should not be too long
without consulting somebody. The most unpleasant thing as to present
comfort, & a thing I never have been used to formerly, is the great
portion of the middle of each night that I lie awake. I do not know the
cause—it does not arise from any painful sensation, nor from coughing.
The snow is mostly melted & the country looks green from our windows but
there has been a north east wind these two days which though not so cold
as one would expect is raw & unpleasant.

I.H. Thursday. Heaven be thanked, here is her Thursday’s letter. It has
not really taken seven days coming as it did not go till Friday, & they
tell me here that it arrived yesterday evening—we may call it 5½ days
which is Edition: current; Page: [129] still very long. Her not writing
sooner is but too well accounted for by her having been unwell & in bed
but now when it has come what an angel of a letter! How loving & how
lovely like everything that its perfect writer writes, says, does or
feels; but it makes me feel very anxious about that cough—I so hope to
hear that it gets better by not catching fresh cold. I am glad she is
taking again to the quinine. If the cough does not improve will she not
send for one of those physicians? At the hotel at Paris I found a book
like the Post office Directory & took down the names of the medical men
at Hyères: they are Allègre, Benet, Brunel, Chassinat, Honoraty,
Verignon. It struck me that Benet (an odd name if French, meaning stupid
ass)7 is perhaps Bennet & that that is the name of the English
physician. By the way, how can you ask such a question darling about
Gurney’s letter—as if there needed any asking for her to open & read
anything addressed to me. Do darling & then inclose it or tell me the
contents whichever is least trouble. I went to Clark this morning: he
examined my chest &c thoroughly & reports favorably so far that he says
there is no organic disease—at the same time he quite justifies my
having gone to him by the very strong impression he has given me that he
thinks me in some degree threatened. In fact when I said “then you find
nothing the matter with my lungs beyond catarrh” he qualified his answer
by saying “not at present”. He prescribed hemlock pills, & mustard
poultices, which I am sure I do not know how Kate will make or I apply:
& recommended my coming again in two or three weeks if not quite well by
that time, that he may examine me again—meanwhile he will look back to
the notes he made formerly—& he let out that he had some “suspicion”
then. However I don’t think he thinks there is much to be afraid of, as
he said nothing about not going out, or about respirators or anything of
that sort—but contented himself with recommending warmer flannels than
those I wear. How very much I enjoy those little details about herself.
I fancy myself looking at that beautiful view with her—which I am so
glad she enjoys—when darling is beginning tea, at half past six, I am
always making it, & then beginning my supper. H[aji] always comes in
before I have done. He behaves very well & his being in the room is
agreeable rather than the contrary. When she wrote this precious letter
on Thursday evening I was probably in the act of arriving at our home.

I think it is best to write Angleterre. A thousand loves & best wishes
for this & all other years.

[P.S.] I meant to have inclosed a note8 this time but have not been able
to get them in time.

Dear Sir

On my arrival I found that Prescott2 had not given you a receipt for the
£250. I shall have much pleasure in giving you one the first time I come
your way.

Mr Pollard Urquhart,3 the member for Westmeath and author of a “Life of
Francesco Sforza”4 & of some ingenious Essays on Political Economy,5 has
written the inclosed paper6 on the Irish Tenant Right question. I think
it quite the best thing I have seen on the subject; moderate,
conclusive, & very judiciously put for English readers. Mr Urquhart is
desirous of offering it to Fraser’s. I therefore send it for the
consideration of the authorities.

very faithfully yrs

The good which that precious letter did me, has not yet left me & will
last a long while. I long however to hear more about her dear health.
The coughing after talking is not an alarming symptom. It is just the
same with me on Edition: current; Page: [131] the bad days of my cough &
yet Clark could not find any organic disease—at least “at present”. By
the way (as I am on the subject) though I see he has suspicions which he
expects to be able to test by reexamination a few weeks hence, I do not
at all regard them 1st, because he had similar suspicions, as it now
appears, five years ago. 2nd, I can see that the side he a little
suspects is the left side: now I have long felt perfectly sure that if
my lungs are ever attacked it will be first & worst on the right side,
as all my ailments without exception always are—& now all my sensations
of uneasiness in the chest back shoulder & side are on the right side
chiefly & almost exclusively. So do not be uneasy darling on account of
what he said. At present my pulse is better but the appearance of
improvement in the cough has ceased—apparently caused by the digitalis &
going off whenever I cease taking that. Chronic catarrh is a very common
old man’s disorder, but I am hardly old enough for it yet—it seems
however that is what I have. I am working hard at getting up the arrear
of India house business & have taken some of it home to work at tomorrow
(Sunday). I hardly feel well or vigorous enough to set about any work of
our own yet on Sundays & in the evenings—when I do the first thing shall
be to finish the rewriting of the paper on Nature,2 which I began before
we left. It is now (yesterday & today) beautiful weather here, that is
for England—mild and clear—but what a difference between this clearness
& that, which my darling is now looking on & which do I not wish I was
looking on along with her. How I rejoice every day in knowing exactly
her whereabout—all the objects about her both indoors & out. I have seen
& heard from or of nobody & have no news to tell. I hope the Spectator
arrived safe. This morning Kate announced that she had no kitchen
candles or soap; the last owing to her having washed things for Haji. I
said you expected her stores of all sorts would last till March. I said
I would write to you about it & in the meantime to order 1 lb of each
from Dalton.3 She also said that there were only potatoes for two or
three days. The last had were a bushel on the 3rd of November; have they
not gone very fast, considering Haji’s three weeks absence & that when
he was here (until the last week) they were only wanted one day in the
week? What does the tax gatherer mean by charging us 12/for “armorial
bearings”? Can he mean the crest on your dear little seal? Webster’s
bill is “Examining correcting & cleaning foreign marble clock 15/, new
winder 2/6. Cleaning & repairing carriage clock (which he spoiled)
12/6d.” Roberts sends a bill of £6/5 for things supplied Feb. 26. Ap. 23
& Sept. 14. I think he was paid the two first & shall look into it.
Chapman (Cooper) sends a bill for 1s3d for “hoop to washing tub.” Todman
a bill Edition: current; Page: [132] for 17/ which it will be very
troublesome to pay. I think we settled that Prescott’s4 clerks were not
to have the Xmas money this year? I find an unexpected difficulty in
getting small notes of the Bank of France. The man I usually employ,
Massey,4 in Leadenhall St. says he has not been able to get any, & I
have tried two other places with no better success—I could get a note
for 500 fr. but that seems too much to risk without first putting forth
a feeler—but if I cannot get soon what I want, I must send that. I have
been nowhere west of Bucklersbury5 where I went to get tea from
Mansell’s.6 Thornton during our absence has published a volume of poems7
in which he has taken the liberty of addressing one to me by name8—it is
an imitation of an epistle of Horace. He apologized for doing it without
leave on account of my absence—a very insufficient apology—in the thing
itself there is little about me, & that little neither good nor harm.
Though the verses in the volume are better than common, he has not
raised my opinion of his good sense by publishing them. I send this
letter unpaid dear as being one that I am sure is not overweight, that
you may see if they do not charge 16 sous, instead of the 10 pence which
must be paid to frank it here. There seems no use in paying an extra
twopence on every letter for the sake of paying here instead of there.
Does there? & now adieu my own precious love. I wait for the next letter
as the greatest & chief pleasure I can have during this absence. A
thousand thousand loves.

I received this morning my precious one’s letter written on the 11th &
12th—how delightfully quick it has come this time. I hope this quickness
will be the general rule. To speak first of the most important thing
that exists, to me, or ever can exist, your health—I do not think there
is anything alarming in those sudden & violent coughs such as this seems
to have been—it is not in that way that organic disease gets on. Such
coughs come & go even where there is already pulmonary disease, & are
not only got rid of, but do not leave Edition: current; Page: [133] what
was already wrong, worse than they found it. As an instance, Sinnett,2
soon after he was pronounced consumptive by Clark, had a most violent,
almost terrible cough, & I happening to see him at the time, thought he
must be in a very bad way—but the next thing I heard about him was that
it was quite gone, & I never heard that he was at all worse after it. On
the whole it is a considerable comfort that you should have had so bad a
cough without any hemorrhage—but that trial having been now made, I am
very happy that it seemed to be going away & I hope in going it will
carry off with it the cough you had before, but if it does not, you are
probably only in the same case with me, whose cough, now three months
old, nothing seems to touch—Clark’s hemlock pills & mustard poultices
appear to have no more effect than Gurney’s remedies. I never knew that
a mere cough, not consumptive, could be as obstinate as this is, but I
believe those influenza coughs last longer than any others. About Mrs
Grote’s letter,3 my darling is I dare say right. It did not escape me
that there was that amende, & I should have felt much more indignant if
there had not. But what was to my feelings like impudent, though
impudent is not exactly the right word, was, that after the things she
has said & done respecting us,4 she should imagine that a tardy sort of
recognition of you, & flattery to me, would serve to establish some sort
of relation between us & her. It strikes me as déplacé to answer the
letter, especially so long after it was written—but her having made this
amende might make the difference of my asking how she is, at least when
he mentions her. That is about as much, I think, as her good intentions
deserve.—I will, dear, say to Grote what she wishes & the best
opportunity will be the first time he writes a note to me in that form.
I do not, & have not for years, addressed him as Mr—& it is very dull of
him not to have taken the hint. I am getting on with India house work
but the arrear will take me a long time—I worked at it at home all
yesterday (Sunday) & got through a good deal. Sunday, alas, is not so
different from other days as when she is here—though more so than when I
am quite with her. I am reading in the evenings, as I said I would do,
Sismondi’s Italian Republics5 which I read last in 1838, before going to
Italy. Having seen so many of the places since makes it very
interesting.

I.H. 17th. This morning I watched the loveliest dawn & sunrise & felt
that I was looking directly to where she is & that that sun came
straight Edition: current; Page: [134] from her. And now here is the
Friday’s letter which comes from her in a still more literal sense. I am
so happy that the cough is better & that she is in better spirits. How
kindly she writes about the keys, never mind darling. I have bought one
set of flannels since. I am glad she likes the note to Sykes. As for
Chapman’s request,6 the pro was the great desire I feel to atone for the
overpraise I have given Comte7 & to let it be generally known to those
who know me what I think on the unfavourable side about him. The reason
that the objection which you feel so strongly & which my next letter
afterwards will have shewn that I felt too, did not completely decide
the matter with me, was that Chapman did not want a review of this
particular book, but of Comte, & I could have got rid of H.M.’s part8 in
a sentence, perhaps without even naming her—I shd certainly have put
Comte’s own book at the head along with hers & made all the references
to it. But malgré cela I disliked the connexion & now I dislike it still
more, & shall at once write to C. to refuse—putting the delay of an
answer upon my long absence so that he may not think I hesitated. It is
lucky he has not called. A propos he has not sent the January number of
the Westr. I will lend the £10 to Holyoake9 as she says darling. I did
not propose the Edinburgh to Urquhart10 because he wanted to publish in
time for the beginning of the session & could not wait till April—so
nothing but a magazine would do. Besides the Ed. would not have taken
it. I have an answer from him, thanking me & accepting my offer to send
it to Parker which I have done. I have no answer from Marshall11—I have
not been able to get a 100 f. note of the B. of F. but I have at last
got the one which I inclose (200 f.). If it goes safe I will send a
larger one next. Now that the snow is melted I must have the gardener to
clear up the place—& I shall be able to pay the bills & taxes. I paid
Kate’s wages. She is exactly all you said—very pleasant to speak to & be
served by—but her excuses are like a person with no sense or head at all
& she requires much looking after. She says Parsons’ bill is wrong
because it charges, during all Haji’s absence about twice the quantity
of meat she professes to have had, & she has twice taken the bill to
make him alter it, but of course she has had the meat, & last Sunday the
fact that a large piece of the roast beef had been cut off was as
palpable as in the worst case I remember with the former cook. I shewed
it to her of course, not charging her with anything but that she might
know I had noticed it.

Another dear letter came today—& did me good not only as they always do,
by the love & sweetness & by the sight of the precious handwriting (she
asked me in one of her letters if I could read the pencil! bless her!)
but also by the pleasant picture of bright sunshine & pure air with June
temperature—which is made so much more pleasant by having seen & knowing
that beautiful view & all that she looked on when she stood on the
balcony that evening. It is delightful to think of her with such
weather—here the weather is not now cold nor very disagreeable, there is
only the total absence of agreeableness, characteristic of English
winter. She says nothing of her health this time—I hope the better news
of the last letter continues. As for my own health she will have seen in
my subsequent letters nearly all there is to tell. I am so glad she
wished me to see Clark. I should not like to go to any one who had not
known my constitution before, therefore certainly not to Gurney’s
doctor. How excessively cool of G.2 to make that very modest request to
Lily! but you judged him right from the first—you always said he was
presuming to the verge of impertinence. It is quite pleasant however to
read about ferns growing in immense abundance. How I wish we could see
them together. The Comte question is decided—Chapman shall have a most
positive negative.3 I sent the £10 to Holyoake4 who has written back a
letter of thanks. I am so glad that my answer to Westbourne5 was right.
A propos the insolence which I think you mean was in Clara’s letter6—I
do not think Harriet was insolent or at least intended to be so—I think
her words have always been much less bad than Clara’s though her conduct
has been much the same—The mistake I made about the bread was very
stupid—I found it out soon after but forgot to say so to her (my dearest
one) & if I had she would have got it too late to save her the trouble
of writing about it. Perhaps too the potatoes have lasted as long as
could be expected. Kate did make Parsons strike out 1¼ lb of beef from
his bill so there was I suppose some truth in what she said.7 She now
declares that there are only Edition: current; Page: [136] coals to last
till Saturday. The two tons which Haji ordered were had on the 12th
November, so they have lasted just nine weeks. I find that the same
quantity had on the 23d May lasted till the 15th August being twelve
weeks: we had not left off fires in the sitting rooms in May, but
perhaps the difference is as little as we could expect. When we had all
the fires in full play two tons only lasted a month. I am sorry to say
darling I have paid most of the bills to the end of the year but I will
get Haji to pay the current ones in future—perhaps once a month will be
sufficient? I took what she said in her last letter about letting bills
& taxes wait till I had less to do, as implying they might be paid when
I had time so I have paid those which lay convenient—even now I think I
must myself pay those at Lee, viz. Upton & Stevens.8 Marshall has just
sent his bill “repairing tea urn cover 9d. new heater 2/. repairing dish
cover 6d. garden fork 3/6. Roberts I see had not been paid at all in the
course of the year. Did the 200 fr. note inclosed in my last arrive
safe? When I hear that it did I will send another—probably a larger. I
inclose a note from M. Laing,9 received today—none of the news seems to
have reached her. You do not say (but I forget in what letter I
mentioned it) whether to send the Adelaide letter.10 Is it not
wonderful, the stand which the Turks are making?11 this last four days
battle, they being the assailants, & completely victorious, seems to me
one of the most remarkable feats of arms in recent history—they must be
not only most determinedly brave but (what nobody expected) excellently
led. Selim Pasha12 one of those who commanded is I believe a Pole—what a
pity Bem13 did not live to see & take part in it. In the last few days
the papers have been full of the Prince Albert political scandal,14
mostly complaining of the public gullibility, but all saying that these
reports were very widely spread over the country & largely believed—the
worth of popularity! Adieu darling for tonight, for I must make & apply
my mustard poultice—you should see me doing it every Edition: current;
Page: [137] evening—not that it or the hemlock pills seem to do any
good, for the cough if better at all is so little so as to leave the
matter doubtful & I am not quite so well otherwise as I was—feverish I
suppose for my face is always flushed & burning & my hands generally. I
shall see Clark soon again therefore. & now my precious more than life,
good night.

I.H. Jan. 20. I am better, darling, than yesterday—I was less feverish
in the night, & my stomach which was somewhat disordered yesterday is
less so today owing to attention to diet. I sleep considerably better
than I did. There is however evidently a good deal wrong about my state,
but whether it is something great or something comparatively small we
cannot at present know. This is, for London, a really bright sunny day
with a mild south wind, & even here such a day is inspiriting. I write
every evening in the little book.15 I have been reading the Essay on
Nature16 as I rewrote the first part of it before we left & I think it
very much improved & altogether very passable. I think I could soon
finish it equally well. Did I not darling some time before leaving, give
you the will? The last one I mean, the one prepared by Gregson.17 I
think I did & I certainly cannot find it, but only all the old wills—&
now again a thousand loves & blessings.

How very happy my beloved one your letter makes me by saying that the
cough is so much better. I longed so for that news & now it has come I
feel quite lighthearted. I have made a copy of Bird’s prescription &
inclose it but I am rather afraid the pharmaciens will not know anything
about Syrup of Iron & Iodide of Quinine. I will when I see Coulson which
I have not done yet, but which I will do immediately, ask him to make an
equivalent prescription which they will understand. Meanwhile luckily
you have some—it is to be taken a teaspoonful thrice a day & Bird
prefers that it should be at or immediately after meals. I too have
thought very often lately about the life2 & am most anxious that we
should complete it the soonest possible. What there is of it is in a
perfectly publishable state—as far as writing goes it could be printed
tomorrow—& it contains a full writing out as far as anything can write
out, what you are, as far as I am competent to describe you, Edition:
current; Page: [138] & what I owe to you—but, besides that until revised
by you it is little better than unwritten, it contains nothing about our
private circumstances, further than shewing that there was intimate
friendship for many years, & you only can decide what more it is
necessary or desirable to say in order to stop the mouths of enemies
hereafter. The fact is there is about as much written as I can write
without your help & we must go through this together & add the rest to
it at the very first opportunity—I have not forgotten what she said
about bringing it with me to Paris.—Now dear about myself, I went again
to Clark on Saturday being thereunto determined by feeling myself worse
in several ways & especially by having had the aguish chill very much
the evening before & a great deal of fever in the night after it. Clark
examined my chest &c carefully again & said there is some congestion of
the lungs, on the right side, but that he does not believe there is any
commencement of organic disease & from the way in which he said it I
feel much more sure than I did before both that he did not keep back
anything, & also that he does not think the cough a really serious
matter. He found some congestion of the liver which he thought was
probably the cause of the fever & other symptoms, & for this he
prescribed acids (nitric & muriatic) & mustard poultices in the region
of the liver. Since that the fever I have had for nearly a fortnight has
very much gone off & I feel better altogether—with regard to the cough
he advised me to do nothing, but leave off the hemlock pills to see what
cough there would be if no sedative were taken. Accordingly it is
somewhat worse, especially at night—but since there seems to be nothing
dangerous about it we must have patience & it will I suppose go off some
time. Thanks darling for the directions about the mustard, but I have
till now applied it without any intervening muslin, direct to the skin
(by advice of one of the partners at Allen’s)3 & as it is, by Clark’s
directions, mixed with an equal quantity of linseed meal, it is not too
strong. In fact I cannot get it strong enough though I keep it on much
longer than the half hour Clark recommended. My having tea at half past
six is by choice—I manage so as to have done my supper & have the tea
ready to pour out when Haji comes in—but the last four days I have dined
in town at a very good & cheap place which Haji told me of, the place
where the French restaurant formerly was, in Gracechurch St. My own
angel Haji is not to blame about the place at table. That where I sit is
now directly opposite the very middle of the fire, & is I think the
warmest—in any case I prefer it to the other. H. does not even always
sit there, but sometimes on the contrary side of the table. He behaves
very well & is even empressé to do things for me as well as give things
up to me—he is altogether much more amiable than I ever knew him, which
is probably to be partly ascribed to his being, as he evidently is, in
very much better health. He does not mope nor sit with Edition: current;
Page: [139] his head on his hand (except a very little occasionally)
can, & does, read nearly all the evening, & is not now at all like an
invalid. I waited for one more letter before writing to Chapman but as
that contained no suggestion about the reply I wrote merely that for
various reasons it was impossible for me to do it4 & that I hoped the
delay of answering had not caused him inconvenience. The first time he
calls however I will say to him what you now suggest. Yesterday was the
loveliest day possible in an English winter—I went out for a little in
the mild & warm sun & enjoyed the beautiful view towards Shooter’s
Hill—what & whom I thought of you do not need that I shd tell. I worked
again all day & part of the evening at India house work. I do not
however think I shall need to do this again, as I have already made a
very perceptible impression on the arrears. Today though it began gloomy
has turned out at last equally fine. The stocks & wallflowers in Lily’s
garden are beginning to flower, & I hope the bitterness of winter is
past. It seems the 26th of Decr was the coldest day; the thermr in
London at zero of Fahrenheit, at Nottingham 4 degrees lower, or 36 below
freezing!

Adieu my perfect—& bless her a million of times.

I got her letter yesterday & though she says it is not a letter I was
delighted to have it, as well as with the promise of another in a day or
two. To take the subjects in their order: the word “threatened” was not
used by Clark but was my own expression of the impression he gave me as
to his opinion, by his guarded phrase ‘at present’ & other signs. You
will have seen since the more decidedly favorable opinion he afterwards
gave—but I agree in all she says about it—no doubt we both are always
threatened with consumption when we are long out of health & we must
endeavour not to be so. I have continued better as to general health, &
the cough after being for two days as I said in my last, rather worse,
became & has been since considerably better, in fact more like a gradual
going off than I have yet thought it—the diminution being both in cough
& expectoration & what I think an improvement in the quality of both.
This is the more encouraging as I am doing absolutely nothing against
the cough. With regard to Thornton I do not think what you say too
severe—he has suddenly plumped down to the place of a quite common
person in my estimation, when I thought he was a good deal better.
Edition: current; Page: [140] There are in the book2 itself many proofs
of excessive, even ridiculous vanity, not much the better for being, as
in his case it is, disappointed vanity. He is far from the first
instance I have known of inordinate vanity under very modest externals.
His misjudgment of me is so far less than you supposed, as he has not
put in any flattery proprement dit, but the fact itself is a piece of
flattery which he must have thought would be agreeable or he would not
have taken so impertinent a liberty. There are so few people of whom one
can think even as well as I did of him, that I feel this a loss, & am
like you angry with him for it.—I will of course resist the charge for
armorial bearings3 but I really do not know whom to call on, for even
the name of the Collector is not given & the only one I can hear of
lives at Charlton. I have paid Webster4—he says he will find & send back
the packing case. About the clock he offered to send his man again,
which I of course declined. Roberts cannot have been paid for I find no
entry this year of his name in the monthly account, so I shall pay him
the first opportunity. I will try to find out why they charge four sous
for the newspaper. At the post office in Leadenhall St, I was told it
would go free. Shall I send the Examiner instead? I had not burned her
notes, dear things as they were, but I have since burnt them all except
the two last (which I shall burn presently) & a bit of one former one
containing what is to be said to Grote, which I wish to have to refer to
now & then until it has been said. I have not yet written to James,5 but
will do so. I have not seen my mother, but have this morning received
from her the inclosed note to which I have answered as inclosed. You
will see I have adopted your idea of what is the matter with Mrs King6
but I rather suspect the stomach—some chronic inflammation of its coats.
I have seen Coulson, & paid him (£10) as I do not expect to have to
consult him again. He thought that day of great pain in the leg very
singular but gave no other opinion on it. I send a prescription which he
wrote for me, equivalent as he said to that of Bird—it is impossible
that Bird’s could be made up at Hyères, as C. says the syrup in question
is peculiar to one particular chemist (Davenport in G. Russell St) but
Coulson’s seems very clear & the handwriting very distinct & no doubt
they can manage it. If not however, he says it could be (or rather the
equivalent of Bird’s could be) sent by post, in the form of a powder.
About the bills—there seems not much amiss in Kate’s goings on. She
takes a second half quartern on Tuesday as well as Saty & that suffices.
The last week I have caused the extra Saty loaf, for Sunday, to be
brown, as I find the underbaked bread (so much the opposite of
Continental) disagrees with me at present & obliges me to eat it (unless
with meat) chiefly in the Edition: current; Page: [141] form of toast.
As to meat we had on Sunday a leg of mutton said in the bill to be 7 lbs
6 oz, which has served me cold the three days following & will serve me
hashed today, H[aji] also having it at breakfast. That is about a pound
a day allowing for bone, or probably a little less. I had quite a
country walk towards Upton’s7 which appears to be about two miles off on
the other side of the Eltham road, however he overtook me in his cart
before I got there; but as it is impossible for either me or Haji to go
all that way to pay the bills weekly or even monthly, I shall henceforth
pay them to the man when he comes in the morning. Milk is about the only
thing not dearer: bread has long been 5½d the half quartern. The weather
here is still very mild & tolerably bright. I enjoy excessively the
thought of the brighter, the really bright sky & pure air & June
temperature she has. Think of me darling as always enjoying it with you,
which I do in the most literal sense—those few bright days with you
there have made that place feel completely my home & will till she
returns.

Adieu my own most precious delight.

I am now writing on the fourth Sunday that I have spent here—it is
positively only three weeks last Thursday evening since I arrived—though
more than a calendar month since I left home, for home to me is those
two rooms. If I were setting out now to go there I should feel it in the
full meaning of the term going home. It is not that the time here is
unpleasant, though, contrary to custom, a time passed entirely in
routine every day similar, has seemed very long: or rather each day has
seemed extremely short, but the whole time wonderfully long. However the
first month in such cases is always the longest, the others pass quickly
enough: I have been feeling much (I must have been incapable of feeling
anything if I had not) about the shortness & uncertainty of life & the
wrongness of having so much of the best of what we have to say, so long
unwritten & in the power of chance—& I am determined to make a better
use of what time we have. Two years, well employed, would enable us I
think to get the most of it into a state fit for printing—if not in the
best form for popular effect, yet in the state of concentrated thought—a
sort of mental pemican, which thinkers, when there are any after us, may
nourish Edition: current; Page: [142] themselves with & then dilute for
other people. The Logic & Pol. Ec. may perhaps keep their buoyancy long
enough to hold these other things above water till there are people
capable of taking up the thread of thought & continuing it. I fancy I
see one large or two small posthumous volumes of Essays, with the Life2
at their head, & my heart is set on having these in a state fit for
publication quelconque, if we live so long, by Christmas 1855; though
not then to be published if we are still alive to improve & enlarge
them. The first thing to be done & which I can do immediately towards it
is to finish the paper on Nature,3 & this I mean to set about today,
after finishing this letter—being the first Sunday that I have not
thought it best to employ in I.H. work. That paper, I mean the part of
it rewritten, seems to me on reading it to contain a great deal which we
want said, said quite well enough for the volume though not so well as
we shall make it when we have time. I hope to be able in two or three
weeks to finish it equally well & then to begin something else—but all
the other subjects in our list will be much more difficult for me even
to begin upon without you to prompt me. All this however is entirely
dependent on your health continuing to go on well; for these are not
things that can be done in a state of real anxiety. In bodily ill health
they might be. I have nothing particular to tell about my health—The
cough has been so variable that I can hardly say how it is, or whether
the improvement I mentioned in my last has been any of it permanent or
not. However there certainly is not a great deal of cough. I live the
most regular of lives, &, fortunately, hardly anybody comes to interrupt
me, so that I get through a great deal of work quietly at the I.H. &
generally rather overstay the hours in order to do more. Ellice has been
away for a fortnight on account of gout. Parker4 called yesterday with
the accounts of last year. The Logic has sold 260 copies in 1853—in 1852
it only sold 206. This steady sale must proceed I think from a regular
annual demand from colleges & other places of education. What is strange
is that the Pol. Ec. Essays sell from 20 to 50 copies each year & bring
in three or four pounds annually. This is encouraging, since if that
sells, I should think anything we put our name to would sell. P. brought
a cheque for £102..2..5 which with the £250, & £25 which Lewis has sent
for the Grote,5 is pretty well to have come in one year from writings of
which money was not at all the object. I have never yet told you of the
books which had been sent during our absence: the chief were, a large
octavo volume in black imitation of thick old binding, with the arms of
the State of S. Carolina stamped on it, consisting of a treatise on
Government & on the Constitution of the U. States by Calhoun,6 with a
printed Edition: current; Page: [143] paper bound into it saying that it
was presented by the Legislature of S. Carolina under whose direction it
had been published & who had passed a resolution authorizing the Library
Committees to present it “to such individuals distinguished for science
learning & public service, & to such libraries as they may select.” This
signed by the Chairmen of the two Comees, of Senate & of H. of
Representatives. I give you this at so much length that you may be able
to judge, whether a letter ought to be written in acknowledgment.7 There
is next a treatise on banking by Courcelle Seneuil,8 who is advertised
as one of the translators of thePol. Econ.9 that is, I suppose, who took
it in hand because Dussard10 failed to get through it. He was one of the
best writers in La République11 & has written a rather nice letter with
the book. He must be written to some time—I should suppose from the
advertisement that the translation is published—but if so I suppose
Guillaumin12 would have sent it.—Helps13 has also sent the thing which
you will see mentioned in today’s Spectator,14 & there are one or two
smaller things not worth mentioning. Parliament meets on Tuesday when we
shall perhaps know a little more about the intentions of the Government
both as to things foreign & domestic. The best thing stirring at present
(save the unexpected eagerness of public opinion to act vigorously
against Russia)15 is, that there is an evident movement for secularizing
education. The Times for weeks past has been writing with considerable
energy on that side of the question,16 & yesterday’s papers contained a
great meeting at Edinburgh,17 Edition: current; Page: [144] of the Free
Church leaders as well as Liberals, for abolishing all religious tests
for schoolmasters in the Scotch parish schools & taking them entirely
out of the control of the clergy. These are signs—

And now here is her darling letter of the 26th which has been longer
than usual in coming. Thank heaven it was not owing to her being ill.
All she says about my health is most sweet & loving, but indeed dearest
you misunderstand the cough, as I have before thought you did. Nothing
could give, to my sensations, a falser idea to the medical men than to
tell them I had had a cough for ten years. I had, as three quarters of
all men have, an occasional need to clear my throat, without the
slightest irritation or titillation or any sensation the least
resembling that of cough, & my present state is totally & generically
different from that habitual one. My real coughs which have been
occasional but very slight, & yet very long in going off entirely, have
always begun as this did with catching cold as indicated by sore throat
at waking in the morning. As you wish dearest, I am not now taking
medicine as the acids which C[lark] prescribed soon disagreed with my
stomach, so I left them off—I shall go to him again in a few days, as
though I am much less feverish I have still a bad tongue at getting up &
I wish to know what he thinks of the difference in the
expectoration—besides as long as the cough persists, it is right to have
a medical opinion pretty often. But I am not in the least out of spirits
& am quite disposed to “put will into resistance” if she will only tell
me what will can do. It is a pleasant coincidence that I should receive
her nice say about the “Nature” just after I have resumed it. I shall
put those three beautiful sentences about “disorder” verbatim into the
essay.18 I wrote a large piece yesterday at intervals (reading a bit of
Sismondi19 whenever I was tired) & am well pleased with it. I don’t
think we should make these essays very long, though the subjects are
inexhaustible. We want a compact argument first, & if we live to expand
it & add a larger dissertation, tant mieux: there is need of both. How
very delightful it is to read her account of that drive to the seaside.
How I should have liked to be there—& how I enjoy her having such nice
summer weather & being able to enjoy it. With regard to the will,
darling, I feel all but certain of having given it to you, & if I did
not, as I do, remember it, I could not doubt it, since it was Edition:
current; Page: [145] locked up in my bedroom drawer for long before & is
not there now. My recollection is of having given it to you in your
bedroom. As for the codicil20 it is not at all needful that it should be
on the same paper. To reexecute the will (useless says Gregson) will be
useless, since I can not remember Gregson’s exact words, & for
everything else the will immediately preceding (which I have safe) will
serve. & now my beloved with a thousand loves & blessings from my
deepest heart farewell.

[P.S.] I inclose a 500 fr. note as the other came safe.

Sir—

I am glad that my book should have afforded you any of the pleasure or
benefit which you do me the honor to tell me you have derived from it.

I have received many letters which, like yours, ask me to explain or
defend particular passages of the Logic. I am not sorry to receive them
as they are a sign that the book has been read in the manner which all
thinkers must desire for their writings—that it has stirred up thought
in the mind of the reader. But my occupations compel me to beg my
correspondents to be satisfied with a more summary explanation of the
opinions they dissent from, than I can generally venture to hope will
remove their difficulties.

It seems to me that there is a fundamental difference between the case
of the rust & that of the motion of a projectile.2 In the case of the
rust the original cause of its existence, were it 1000 years ago, may be
said to be the proximate cause, since, as there has been no intermediate
change of any sort, there is no cause more proximate than it. You may
say, there is the existence of the rust itself during the intermediate
time. I answer, the rust all through the 1000 years is one & the same
fact, therefore we do not say that it causes itself: but the motion in
successive instants (though, as you say, it may be the same qua motion)
is, taken in its ensemble, a different fact, since it is essentially
constituted by a different phenomenon, viz. the body in one place
instead of the same body in another place. The argument is still
stronger when the motion is not even the same qua motion—when besides
the difference in the fact itself, there has also intervened the action
Edition: current; Page: [146] of a new cause, a deflecting force or a
resisting medium. The concurrence of forces at each successive instant
is then a cause evidently more proximate to the effect of the next
instant than the original impulse, which, therefore, can only be called
the remote cause.

Our difference is more one of expression than of fact. It seems to me
that when there is a change of any sort at that precise point we ought
to say that a fresh causation commences. It is only while things remain
exactly as the original cause left them, that the original can be also
termed the proximate cause of their state.

I am Sir
 yrs very truly

I have just received your Sunday’s letter my own darling love. What you
say of your weakness & want of appetite makes me very uneasy—the first
however would alarm me more if it were not accompanied with the second,
for want of appetite is not I believe an ordinary effect of
consumption—it rather seems to indicate something else amiss, which
therefore may be the cause also of the weakness. I wish you had Gurney
or somebody as good to ask about it, for if it is as I hope, it is very
likely that some simple remedy would cure it as Clark’s did (or I
suppose did) my liver ailment which disturbed the general system much
more than the cough. Respecting living on the Continent we have always
said that that question must be decided this coming summer—As far as
climate is concerned Blackheath in summer is as good as any place &
better than any which is very hot—but of course only with a minimization
of housekeeping, which must be reduced as nearly as possible to what it
was at Nice. Whether we hold on to the I.H.2 I think should depend on
where you are able to live during the winter, for example if the I[sle]
of W[ight] would be suitable, I could come so often that it would not
amount to a separation. These things however I hope we shall talk about
many times fully before it is necessary to decide them. Meanwhile if the
strength & appetite do not return with the quinine, will you not see
Alègre? Very probably he could at once correct the cause of those
symptoms—A Edition: current; Page: [147] minor reason for seeing him
would be that as they say he has lived some years in England, he would
understand prescriptions & could make the chemists make them up right.
If they cannot be trusted with Coulson’s prescription shall I adopt his
suggestion & send the iodine &c in powder inclosed in a letter?—As for
myself I am in statu quo, putting off from day to day another visit to
Clark—the cough sometimes seeming to get worse, then better again—today
it is better after being considerably worse for two days before. I have
written at the Nature3 every evening since Sunday & am getting on pretty
well with it. I shall not know what to attempt when that is done. I do
not expect there will be a good opportunity or a necessity to write
about the ballot—that opinion of Montesquieu & of Cicero4 has often been
quoted in opposition to it before. I will send the Examiner hereafter
instead of the Spectator. You ought to see a newspaper now that
Parliament has met. The Queen’s speech5 has rather disappointed people
by its mild tone on the Russian question but I am myself convinced by
all that was said in the debates in both houses that the Govt are
expecting war & mean to carry it on vigorously by sea at all events. In
other respects it is the best programme there has been for years:
Parliamentary reform6 which I thought would be shelved on account of the
war—more law reform,7 including the taking away will & marriage causes
from the ecclesiastical courts—reform of the Universities by Act of
Parlt8—reform of the law of settlement,9 now a great evil—what most
surprises me, a plan to be brought forward for regulating the admission
to public offices,10 which is fully understood to be the extension to
all of them of the competition plan adopted last year for the civil
service in India.11 It was plain enough that when once introduced
anywhere it would spread, but I little thought the very next session
would see Edition: current; Page: [148] it adopted in the Govt offices.
The mere attempt to make patronage go by merit & not by favour seems to
me to be a revolution in English society & likely to produce greater
effects than any reforms in the laws which we can expect for a long
time. This Govt also, determined to get through work & be thought men of
business, have already named early days for bringing in nearly all their
bills, even Parl. reform in less than a fortnight. I am really curious
to see what it will be like.—I have paid most of the bills, including
Roberts, & got their receipts. Winter it has only quite lately occurred
to me that I could have paid when I went to Clark, quite close by.12 I
shall do so the next time. Kate has been moderate with her candles &
soap, for a pound of each was had in the middle of last month & she has
not yet asked for any more. I sent a 500 fr. note in my last, dated the
30th. You will surely want more dearest. It is best to have a margin. By
the bye my travelling expenses were much within the margin, for when I
left Boulogne I had after giving 17 fr. for an umbrella, 86 fr. left out
of 300 and odd. I inclose a letter from Sykes. With the deepest and
entirest love

your own

I cannot think or care about anything my own beloved one except your
precious health. It is such a comfort to me that you felt better the day
you sent your letter. Though that does not prove much, still the better
of one day is something to set against the worse of another. About our
plans, dearest, they should all be made on the supposition of living. We
should do what will be best on the supposition that we live. At all
events it is of little use considering what would be desirable in the
hypothesis of my outliving you, for if I wished it ever so much—which I
never could do for any other reason than because you wish it—I do not
see how it would be possible for me to escape being made consumptive by
real long continued fear of the worst, even before the worst has time to
happen. But do not let this alarm you about me my darling, for I am
neither feeling worse physically nor more anxious than I have felt ever
since that first attack at Nice. I think we have a good Edition:
current; Page: [149] chance of living a few years at least & that it is
worth while to make plans on that probability. I did not understand what
you meant dearest in your last by saying that in that case you are
wanted here—I am sure you need not in the smallest degree consider
anyone who would or could want you here—Lily and I as you know only want
to be with you wherever you are.—I have little to tell of any kind. I
have not been to Clark yet which you may know is a sign that I do not
think myself worse. By working an hour or two every evening at the
Nature2 I have very nearly finished it: tonight or tomorrow will I
believe do everything to it that I am at present capable of doing. There
is a pleasure in seeing any fresh thing finished at least so far as to
be presentable. I shall then look again through the Life.3 I have got
through at least three fourths of the I.H. arrears, as fortunately the
two mails which have come in since my return have brought little or
nothing—I never remember such small mails. That would have been the time
to be away! I have read through another new volume of Comte;4 there is
no fresh bad in it. It is quite curious the completeness and compactness
of his theory of everything—& the perfectness, without flaw, of his
self-satisfaction. A number of the N. American review has been sent with
an article headed “J. S. Mill on Causation”5 forming the rejoinder of
Bowen6 (the editor) to the reply to him in the third ed.7 of the Logic.
It is remarkably feeble & poor & a couple of lines in another edition8
would dispose of it—but it is good to see the subject stirred up & that
book taking its place as the standard philosophical representative in
English (unhappily now the only one) of the anti-innate principle &
anti-natural-theology doctrines. While I write, in comes a note from one
of the Kingsley set9 who has written before, as you probably remember. I
send his affected note which asks leave to reprint the chapter on the
Future of the Labouring Classes.10 Of course I must tell him that he
must ask leave of Parker, but I should perhaps tell him also, &
certainly should be prepared to tell Parker, whether I have any
objection myself.11 I should think I have not: what does my angel think?
I did not expect the Xtian Socialists Edition: current; Page: [150]
would wish to circulate the chapter as it is in the 3d edit. since it
stands up for Competition against their one-eyed attacks & denunciations
of it. You will I am afraid have the Spectator once more, as I was too
late, for this week, in countermanding it, at least Wray12 said so,
though I cannot conceive how, even for a Saturday paper as it professes
to be, Friday morning can be too late. But it did not seem worth making
him send an express to town as he said he must do. Public events seem to
be going as we wish. Clarendon’s13 last letter to Russia is unexpectedly
firm & high handed14—the ambassadors you see are going away;15 the Post
today says,16 professedly from authority, that Nicholas17 will now be
called on to evacuate the principalities18 & that on his refusal England
& France will declare war.19 The Times says nothing of this but (for the
first time) says today20 that Prussia & Austria21 have decided to stand
by the other two even to the length of fighting. This seems too good
news to be all of it true: but for some time England has been in every
quarter making preparations for war in good earnest & the despatch is
now printed22 in which the fleets in the Black Sea23 were ordered to
require & if needful compel all Russian ships of war to retire to
Sebastopol & remain there. Nicholas I think is in a scrape, & will
hardly get out of it without serious loss of at least prestige, which is
the main source of his power.—Sharpers24 has sent a bill of £6.8 or
rather a memorandum “To Bill delivered”. Was any bill delivered? As you
said dearest it shall wait.

Your Thursday’s letter, my perfect one, did not arrive till this morning
(Tuesday). I trembled in opening it for fear lest it should say you were
less well, & you may conceive the joy it gave me to read that for so
many days you had been better than at any time since we arrived—that
delightful news makes everything seem bright & cheerful. I had asked
myself that question about the books. It would be a great privation, in
living abroad, to be without books of our own, dependent entirely on
public libraries which, except at Paris, are almost always limited to
particular classes of books, but as we should doubtless end by fixing
ourselves in some place I thought we should leave our books somewhere
for a year or two & send for them afterwards. Our decision may be
affected by the question of health in another way which we have not yet
considered, depending on my health, for if that should get worse I
should be able to leave the I.H. with two thirds of my salary,2 which
would make a very great difference in the aspect of matters. I went to
Clark yesterday; he found the congestion in one part of the right lung
not worse, but not better either, & recommended a blister or rather a
substitute in the form of a blistering fluid, applied just over that
place; which I have done but with no good effect apparent as yet, for
the cough & irritation in the night & today are greater than they have
been lately. He found the liver still congested, which he says tends to
keep up the pulmonary congestion, & he gave me an alterative aperient,
the mercurial chalk & rhubarb, but to be taken only when required. When
I left him I paid Mrs Winter’s3 bill, but not to herself, for she has
left the business & there is a plate on the door Mrs Cresswell successor
to Mrs Winter. The young woman there gave me however as she said she
could do, a receipt in behalf of Mrs Winter. I will tell my mother the
first time I have occasion to write, all you mention. She is very
familiar with gallstones as one of her sisters has been several times at
death’s door with them. That perhaps confirms your conjecture as I
believe all diseases are apt to go in families since constitutions &
temperaments do so. About the pensions,4 it occurred to me just after I
had sent the note to Edition: current; Page: [152] my mother & written
about it to you, that the meaning of the difference of amount must be
that since last summer the two smaller pensions are subject to income
tax, which of course has been deducted at the I.H. though when the
warrants merely passed through my hands I did not notice it. So I wrote
a single sentence to my mother explaining it, since which I have heard
nothing more from her. I finished the “Nature”5 on Sunday as I expected.
I am quite puzzled what to attempt next—I will just copy the list of
subjects we made out in the confused order in which we put them down.
Differences of character (nation, race, age, sex, temperament). Love.
Education of tastes. Religion de l’Avenir. Plato. Slander. Foundation of
morals. Utility of religion. Socialism. Liberty. Doctrine that causation
is will. To these I have now added from your letter: Family, &
Conventional. It will be a tolerable two years work to finish all that?
Perhaps the first of them is the one I could do most to by myself, at
least of those equally important.6 I do not the least remember what you
say I said darling one of those rather pleasant days, but I have no
doubt it was not half of what I thought. I shall make a point of saying
something emphatic to Haji to remind him of what he must very well know
I think or rather know. It is so very pleasant to read of that splendid
weather, knowing that you are really having it. Here we had for two or
three days a return of frost & one day of dense fog, but it has gone
away again & is now quite mild, & yesterday was very fine & sunny but
most days are dull & cloudy though it seldom rains. The dear place looks
very well and I have had the gardener to make it tidy, but I shall not
have him any more till you tell me. I am glad you will have had the
Examiner yesterday instead of the Spectator; the characteristic of which
seems to me to be tame commonplace, which in England always means
vulgar. The Examiner is certainly better, though ridiculously weak
sometimes—for example how ludicrous that deification of Lady Russell’s
letters,7 & done in such good faith too, for he quotes the things he
admires—he is evidently so overpowered with the fact of a man’s wife
being in love with him that he thinks any even the most house-maidlike
expression of that fact quite superhuman. Then what can be in a worse
spirit than the remarks on the conference at the Socy of Arts.8 It is
the driest & narrowest of the old political economy, utterly unconscious
of the existence of a newer & better. Still I greatly prefer the Ex. to
the Spectator.—The letters darling are charged double here, the same as
there, that is as many times 10d as the French post charges 8d. I once
had to pay 2/1 for a Edition: current; Page: [153] letter, being 2½
times the single postage. We seem to be really now at war,9 & with
general approval. The English have shown pluck in spite of all the Times
could do.10

Adieu my darling with every possible blessing.

My precious one I hoped, though I did not venture to expect, a letter
today, but I am not disappointed, for such good news as the last
contained will hold out for a good while. Still I long for another to
confirm it. You will be surprised when I tell you that I went again to
Clark this morning—& I am afraid you will think I am fidgety about my
ailments, but the reverse is the case, for I never was so much the
opposite of nervous about my own health, & I believe whatever were to
happen I should look it in the face quite calmly. But my reason for
going today was one which I think would have made you wish me to
go—namely the decided & unmistakeable appearance of blood in the
expectoration. Clark however on my describing it to him, does not think
it of any importance, but thinks it is very likely not from the lungs, &
even if it does come from them, thinks it is from local & very
circumscribed congestion not from a generally congested state. Very glad
was I to hear anything which diminishes the importance of bleeding in a
chest case. I knew before that it is not at all a sure sign of
consumption, as it often accompanies bronchitis—which is the real
technical name of my cough, though it sounds too large & formidable for
it. I am very well convinced, since Clark thinks so, that I am not in a
consumption at present, however likely this cough is to end in that—for
it seems to resist all the usual remedies. The favourable circumstance
is that none of my ailments ever seem to yield to remedies, but after
teazing on for an unconscionable time, go away or abate of themselves—as
perhaps this will if all goes well with my dearest one. Indeed, if I had
belief in presentiments I should feel quite assured on that point, for
it appears to me so completely natural that while my darling lives I
should Edition: current; Page: [154] live to keep her company. I have
not begun another Essay yet, but have read through all that is written
of the Life2—I find it wants revision, which I shall give it—but I do
not well know what to do with some of the passages which we marked for
alteration in the early part of it which we read together. They were
mostly passages in which I had written, you thought, too much of the
truth or what I believe to be the truth about my own defects. I
certainly do not desire to say more about them than integrity requires,
but the difficult matter is to decide how much that is. Of course one
does not, in writing a life, either one’s own or another’s, undertake to
tell everything—& it will be right to put something into this which
shall prevent any one from being able to suppose or to pretend, that we
undertake to keep nothing back. Still it va sans dire that it ought to
be on the whole a fair representation. Some things appear to me on
looking at them now to be said very crudely, which does not surprise me
in a first draft, in which the essential was to say everything, somehow,
sauf to omit or revise afterwards. As to matters of opinion & feeling on
general subjects, I find there is a great deal of good matter written
down in the Life which we have not written anywhere else, & which will
make it as valuable in that respect (apart from its main object) as the
best things we have published. But of what particularly concerns our
life there is nothing yet written, except the descriptions of you, & of
your effect on me; which are at all events a permanent memorial of what
I know you to be, & (so far as it can be shewn by generalities) of what
I owe to you intellectually. That, though it is the smallest part of
what you are to me, is the most important to commemorate, as people are
comparatively willing to suppose all the rest. But we have to consider,
which we can only do together, how much of our story it is advisable to
tell, in order to make head against the representations of enemies when
we shall not be alive to add anything to it. If it was not to be
published for 100 years I should say, tell all, simply & without
reserve. As it is there must be care taken not to put arms into the
hands of the enemy.—I think dear you should have another 500 f. note.
The posting to Chalon will cost with three horses about £18, with two
£14: the railway from Chalon to Paris £3/4 without reckoning baggage for
which there will be a high charge. The inns with slow travelling will
cost a good deal & you ought not to arrive at Paris3 without something
in hand—so you will not have margin enough. Perhaps less than 500 f.
might do, but since it goes safe, & is easier to get than a smaller
note, it is better. But I shall hear more about it in your next letter4
my beloved.

With a thousand thousand blessings.

I got your darling letter of the 6th yesterday, my adored one. Touching
our difference about the cough—I dare say I was wrong, my beautiful one
since you say so, about most men having a habit of occasionally clearing
the throat. However the habit I had was not what I mean by a cough;
since it was not excited by any irritation, or any sensation except of
huskiness—was always voluntary—& in fact consisted only in a little more
than the average secretion of mucus from a membrane which is one of
those called mucous because its universal function is always to secrete
some. Then there never was enough to cause expectoration, but when from
sneezing or any other accident a little was brought up, it was pure,
transparent & colourless—the appearance of health—while this from the
beginning has been of the kind I know so well, the greenish yellow mixed
with transparent, which belongs to bronchitis & consumption, for in this
respect both are alike until tuberculous deposits begin to be coughed
up. Latterly too the transparent part has in great measure become white,
opaque & dense enough to sink in water which however Clark agrees with
me in thinking nothing of. Then you know even that clearing the throat
(for so I must call it & not cough, since it is a quite different action
of the throat, & one which I can do now, & quite distinguish from cough)
went quite away, & staid away for a year or more—it only came back a
year ago, certainly as a legacy left behind by a cough I then had. I did
not mean to write so prolixly on this very idle subject—but granting it
was a cough, if this one can be brought back to what that was, I shall
think it cured. Clark does not think the liver the cause or main seat of
my ailments, though congestion there in his opinion tends to keep up the
other disorder—but he decidedly says there is congestion in one place of
the lungs. As to care about my appointments in going to Clark, I have
been attentive to them. I always wore one of my best shirts, those with
the invisible buttons, not the linen because they were so much older—but
if you think it desirable I will buy some linen. The braces I will
attend to—hitherto those I bought at Nice have seemed good enough. The
criticisability of the flannels was not as to their quality, for they
were very good, & quite new—but he thought them not thick enough &
recommended wearing another sort (with short sleeves) over them which I
have done ever since. I got a new hat the other day in honor of him (&
Mrs Winter)2 & on the whole have behaved very well in the Edition:
current; Page: [156] matter, though I say it that shouldn’t. The
Americans3 & the Frenchman4 shall be written to, though I regret the
necessity as it obliges me to read or at least look through the
Frenchman’s large book on banking,5 which yesterday & today I have begun
doing. After so long a delay I must if possible say to him something
complimentary about it. His letter is dated in October & directed
Monsieur John Stuart Mill, économiste, à Londres. I wonder if a letter
similarly directed would reach a Frenchman. This was sent to the
“Economist” office & “returned not known.” How they found out or what
good genius suggested to the P. office to try the India house I don’t
know. The book was sent to Delizy’s6 & therefore came easily, as his
place is frequented by Frenchmen who know me. Your programme of a letter
to him is not an easy one to execute, but as I can speak well of his
articles in La République,7 I can no doubt make the letter flattering &
thence (if he is unlike me) agreeable. Helps8 is a very poor creature
but quite made to be the triton of such minnows as the literary lions of
this day, & like all of them he is made worse than he would be by self
conceit. He is after all rather better than Henry Taylor.9 How true all
you say of Sykes’ letter & of Emilia.10 We see however how right it was
to make a point of calling on her & that it has answered its purpose.
One never repents of having followed your judgment. As for the rascal
Verignon11 I read about him with compunction thinking how near the same
thing was to happening before through my fault. Have you, darling,
demanded a copy of the prescription? for he will perhaps admit having
copied it (as they all do) into his book. If it is one of Gurney’s shall
I write to him, if you have not, asking for it again? The loss of
appetite especially as you are better in other respects, puzzles me.
Your being better is I should think very much owing to the fine weather,
& it makes me anxious that you should not be in haste to set out for
Paris, since you will find very different weather as soon as you get out
of Provence if not even before. Here it is now cold March weather with
northerly winds & hardly ever a really bright day. The Govt plan for
appointments to public offices seems thorough & admirable if I can judge
from the Times12 which has had some excellent articles, quite above the
Times, in praise of it, but it is not appreciated. The Edition: current;
Page: [157] Post13 is furious against it & there is much opposition
brewing. As for parl. reform all sides in the two houses are bawling out
“this is not the time, in war we must have no apple of discord” in which
trash the Times has now joined.14

Dear Sir

I owe an apology for not having given an earlier answer to a proposal
which does me so much honour as that made in your letter of the 3d
respecting the chapter of my Pol. Econ. on the Future of the Labouring
Classes.2 I am glad that you think its circulation among the working
people likely to be useful; and I am sure that whatever helps to make
them connect their hopes with cooperation, and with the moral qualities
necessary to make cooperation succeed, rather than with strikes to
impose bad restrictions on employers, or simply to extort more money,
will do for them what they are greatly in need of. I therefore so far as
depends upon me, give my full consent and approbation to your public
spirited project—but I should like first to make some little additions
to the chapter, tending to increase its usefulness. I must add also that
the consent of Mr Parker is necessary, the edition of the P.E. now on
sale being his property.3

Here is your letter of the 9th my darling darling love. It quite settles
the matter against your coming, & only leaves the question open whether
I should Edition: current; Page: [158] not at once go to you. I was in
hopes, before, that you could cross the Channel without return of
hemorrhage, as that very violent cough (continued for some days) had not
produced it. When I said, our plans should be formed on the supposition
of living, I meant that they should not be formed (as I was afraid yours
were) in the supposition that it was not worth giving up the I.H. unless
with a more sure prospect of life than there is. It is worth giving it
up for any prospect of life & not worth keeping it for anything that
life deprived of you could give me if I survived your loss. Do not think
however my own love that I am as you say ennuyé in your absence. I am
not & never should be ennuyé, & I have on the contrary very much
excitement, the expectation, namely, & reading of your letters. It is
the delight of being with you, & all the delight you give me when I am
with you, that is my loss. But to think for an instant of that as a
reason for your coming, would be monstrous, though it is a very strong
reason for my going. In fact the thing which goes farthest with me on
the side of not giving up the I.H. at once is, the extreme probability
of my having a strong medical recommendation to pass the next winter
abroad,2 which would enable me, while holding on here for the present,
to pass six months with you in the climate we might think most suitable.
I call this an extreme probability because even if my cough goes away in
spring, the obstinacy of it proves such a decided predisposition that I
am very likely to have it again next winter, & to diminish the chance of
that, passing the winter abroad in hopes of breaking the habit would
probably be the recommendation of any medical man. As to our meeting—if
it is not for the purpose of crossing, why should you go through the
immense fatigue & danger of that journey to Paris? It is true that
Hyères would be too hot to be a fit place for remaining in during the
summer & I wish I knew the place fittest for that, & at the same time
not so far as Paris from any place which would be suitable for next
winter—but it would be as difficult for you to get to Geneva or Bordeaux
as to Paris. This requires a great deal of consideration & perhaps a
medical opinion—but whether for Paris or anywhere else you should not
think of leaving Hyères till it is quite spring—you will see by what I
wrote yesterday that even before this last letter I was anxious that you
should not leave soon. I do not think there is any real difference in
the facility of my getting away at or after Easter—that sort of notion
is becoming more & more gone-by and disregarded. Much more will depend
on what happens to be doing here at the time, & whether Oliphant3 or the
Chairman whoever he is, feels embarrassed or not. On the whole that is
not worth considering. I hope darling that the spitting of blood is like
mine, immaterial, & will not continue. Mine has not returned. Increase
Edition: current; Page: [159] of cough I every now & then have, & pains
in the chest so much & often that I have got utterly to despise them.
How much cough have you my dearest life? I have not forgotten that I am
to bring the biography4 with me. It is mentioned in the codicil, &
placed at your absolute disposal to publish or not. But if we are not to
be together this summer it is doubly important to have as much of the
life written as can be written before we meet—therefore will you my own
love in one of your sweetest letters give me your general notion of what
we should say or imply respecting our private concerns. As it is, it
shews confidential friendship & strong attachment ending in marriage
when you were free & ignores there having ever been any scandalous
suspicions about us. I will answer Furnivall5 as you say. I do not know
what alterations the chapter6 requires & cannot get at it as the last
edition is locked up in the plant room. I can of course get from Parker
another copy, or even those particular sheets from the “waste”. I
imagine that if I tell Furnivall of making alterations he will be
willing to give me time enough—besides I could send you the chapter by
post. I send the Examiner again today & am very glad it is so much
better than the Spectator. Tonight Lord John Russell is to introduce his
Reform Bill,7 so we shall see what the aggregate wisdom of this ministry
can do in that respect.

Adieu with all possible love.

[P.S.] This time it is the large note I cannot get, & I can get small
ones, so I will send them by instalments.

Sweetest & kindest—to write so soon to give him the comfort of knowing
that she was better—& indeed darling the good it does him is worth the
trouble. If the improvement is owing to the weather being cooler, it is
curious—though it seems likely enough that heat should cause weakness &
loss of appetite, but strange that the heat of January should do so;
even in Provence. There seems more coincidence in the changes of weather
there & here than Edition: current; Page: [160] I shd have expected.
Here too it has been much colder for several days, & even a good deal of
ice, but the frost went away last night. I am never without thinking on
what is best to be done—When I said that our plans should be on the
supposition of living, I meant that they should be on the supposition
that we could live by doing every thing that could most help towards
living, not by doing anything contrary to it—that therefore the
uncertainty of life should not prevent our giving up England if that is
the best thing to do on the supposition of life. When I thought of your
passing the summer here it was under the idea that in summer England is
as good a place for weak lungs as any that we could fix upon—but this of
course assumed that you would be able to bear the coming (& also the
crossing again for the next winter in the very probable case of its
being necessary) & that, I now see, is much too formidable a risk to be
run, at all events unless you get very much better first, if even then.
Is it your idea to stay the summer at Paris? If so & if we determine not
to give up the I.H. directly, I must come over as often as I can if only
for a day or two, & hope for a six months absence on medical certificate
next winter.2 I am anxious to know how much cough you have—how often in
the day you cough, & whether in the night & at getting up. Is there any
expectoration? have you spit blood again? what was the blood like—florid
red like arterial blood therefore quite fresh, or dark blue venous
blood? If the former, Clark thinks nothing of it. I see no reason
against asking Clark who is the best English physician at Paris. His
information is probably fresher than about Nice where he knew nothing
about Gurney but only Travis.3—The ministry have produced their Parl.
Reform bill4 & I must say it does more than I expected from them—I say
more, not better, as it is very doubtful if lowering the franchise will
not do more harm than good. It is to be lowered in boroughs from £10 to
£6 houses, but with a provision requiring two years & a half
residence—which is like giving with one hand to take back with the
other. How far this provision will go to neutralize the concession or
how the thing will work practically, nobody I suppose knows. Besides
this, the county franchise is given to all £10 householders who have not
votes for towns—which will take away many counties from the landed
influence altogether. Also all graduates of any university are to have
votes; all who pay £2 income tax or assessed taxes, or have £10 a year
in the funds or Bank or India stock, or who receive £100 a year salary
public or private (but not including weekly wages) or have had for three
years, £50 in the savings bank. You see there is no new principle &
some, but very little practical improvement in the conditions of the
franchise. 19 small boroughs are to be disfranchised, & 33 which return
two Edition: current; Page: [161] members each are to be reduced to one.
Every town or county of more than 100,000 inhabitants is to elect three
members instead of two, the metropolitan districts however (except
Southwark) being excepted. A new district returning two members is to be
made of Kensington & Chelsea, & three more manufacturing towns are to
elect one member each. The inns of court! are to elect two members (as
if there were not lawyers enough in the house) & the London University
one. They have also adopted the idea that universities ought to be
represented in proportion to their numbers—but instead of Marshall’s5 &
Grey’s6 good plan of doing this by allowing voters to give all their
votes to one person, they propose that where there are three to be
elected, each elector shall only be allowed to vote for two. This
insures its rejection, for John Bull will never see reason why when
three members are to be elected he should only be able to give two
votes. You will see it all in next week’s Examiner7 & probably some both
good & bad remarks on it. The Exr seems to me much better than the
Spec[tator]—not such a dry dead level—much higher generally, & sometimes
sinking lower. I think it has more & better aperçus than the Specr. I
shd like the Specr better if I thought it purposely kept back opinions,
but it always seems to me as if its system & preference was for saying
something against whatever looks like a principle. The trash talked
about Albert8 disgusted me as it did you. That Campbell9 is an odious
animal—It was so like him to make the Marriage Commission10 recommend
that men shd be able to get divorce in the one case & women not. The
Post,11 always right feeling on such subjects, speaks of this as
monstrous, & says, make it easy & cheap to both; of course however only
meaning I am afraid, in the one permitted case.

Edition: current; Page: [162]
I did not mention you, dear, at Winter’s except saying I called to pay a
little bill of my wife’s. I will make Sharpers give a bill & then pay
it.

I inclosed 200 fr. in my last & now inclose the remainder of the 500.

Bless you my own—& love me as you do.

I am writing dearest with snow again on the ground (though it seems to
be melting) & very cold windy weather. I hope it continues cooler there
too, since the cooler weather seems to agree best with you. I did not
much expect a letter today as the last came sooner than usual—but on
Monday perhaps—& happy shall I be if it says you continue better. As for
me I continue much the same, except that the digestion, somehow, is
decidedly worse than it was at Nice & on the way here. I wrote to
Furnivall2 in the manner you wished, & have had two notes from him
since. The first short “I am very much obliged to you for your kind
letter of yesterday, & will communicate forthwith with Messrs Parker &
Son, & then again with you as to the additions to the chapter.” The
other which came this morning “Messrs P. & Son have given me their
consent to your chapter on” &c “being reprinted. If you will be kind
enough to send me the additions you said you would be so good as to
make, as soon as is convenient to you, I will have the chapter as
revised set Edition: current; Page: [163] up immediately on receipt of
them, & send you a proof.” I wrote a short answer3 asking for a few days
time to consider how I could improve it, & wrote to Parker for the
sheets4—they will come I suppose on Monday & I will send them to my
precious guide philosopher & friend by that day’s post. I have not the
least idea at present what additions they require, but between us we
shall I am sure manage to improve them very much. I have also finished
reading the Frenchman’s book,5 & as a week’s addition to the months he
has waited for a reply can make no difference, I send her his note & a
draft of a reply6—It has given me a good deal of trouble & I have not
made a good thing of it at last, but my dearest one will. Shall I date
it India House or Blackheath? I am reading the American book,7 a
Treatise on Government generally & on the institutions of the U. States
in particular—it is considerably more philosophical than I expected, at
least in the sense of being grounded on principles—& the stile, except
in being rather diffuse, may be called severe—the writing of a logician
not an American rhetorician. But there is not a word to take the writer
out of the category of hewers of wood & drawers of water. He is in some
points a very inferior likeness of my father. One did not expect that in
an American, but if in any, in this particular man. I will send you the
draft of a letter in acknowledgment of the gift when I have written
one.8—I want to consult you about writing to Lewis to ask a release from
my promise of an article on India.9 He reminded me of it in a short note
inclosing payment for the article on Grote,10 & I said in reply that I
could not at all say when it would be ready—but I think I ought to give
it up wholly. It would take very great trouble & much time to do it
well, & so as to be unimpeachable in all matters of fact—& I do not
think I ought to spare so much time for so secondary a matter when there
is so much of the first importance to be written—I never should have
undertaken it had I not thought that most part of the labour it would
require must be undergone at all events for the sake of the I.H., & my
remaining in the I.H. long enough to make the labour of much use there
is now so very problematical that it would be almost a waste of time
that may be so much better employed. I am most anxious at present about
the Life,11 but I can do little in the way of addition to it till I hear
from her. In my last letter but one I inclosed a 200 fr. note, & in the
last a 200 & a 100. We are now all but actually at war, & shall probably
be in the thick of it in a few weeks12—the sending troops to Turkey &
and that vast fleet to the Baltic are like serious work. There is
perfect Edition: current; Page: [164] unanimity among all parties here &
the war feeling seems to pervade everybody in a manner which nobody
thought would ever happen again. I am glad of it, but there is one great
evil which is happening from all this—the complete rehabilitation of
Louis Napoleon.13 Nothing could possibly have been more opportune for
him—Instead of being stigmatized as an usurper even by two cabinet
ministers,14 as he was just before this, he is now the champion of
freedom & justice, receiving the highest compliments from Tory, Whig &
Radical—the friend of England, the honest straightforward politician &
diplomatist whom ministers, members of parliament & newspapers are never
tired of praising. I do not think he will ever now be unpopular in this
country unless he does something grossly iniquitous which he now has no
motive to do. To destroy the power & prestige of Russia is a great
thing, but it is dearly bought at that price. Then I do not at all
believe that while the war lasts there will be a sufficient popular
feeling to carry this or any other Reform Bill15 against the H. of
Lords. Perhaps that is not of much consequence however.—I have seen
nobody this long while, enjoying a happy immunity from calls—except now
& then some bore of an old Indian. & now adieu with the utmost possible
love.

Dear Sir

As I understand from Mr Furnivall that he has obtained your consent to
his reprinting the chapter of the Pol. Econ. on the Future of the
Labouring Classes,2 & as I should like to make some little improvements
first, I should be obliged by your sending me the sheets of the chapter,
if possible, from the waste.

I should think the separate circulation of the chapter as he proposes
would promote rather than affect injuriously the sale of the entire
work.

Your letter of the 14th and 15th my own love arrived about the middle of
today.2 Thank heaven it says you continue better, if only a little. How
is it my darling that you say you have broken the habit of
expectoration? When you cough are you not obliged to swallow something
if you do not spit it up? I seldom expectorate now except in the morning
while dressing—but the secretion is still there though I do not throw it
out. However it is, I really think, less in quantity than it used to be,
& if as you advise I exert myself to the utmost to check coughing
perhaps it will diminish still more. I think darling if you now have no
expectoration at all after having had some, you cannot have consumption:
dry cough I have always understood is only in the very earliest stage of
the disease, & expectoration when it does begin always increases—How are
you now as to appetite? & strength? I have a return this evening of
aching in the right thigh—I hope it is not to be like that day at the
Hotel des Ambassadeurs.

How strange, that snow & intense cold after a month of summer heat.
Certainly going from a London to a Hyères winter would not be avoiding
great & abrupt changes of temperature. The snow here has melted again—it
is still cold, but not intensely so. Your programme of an essay on the
utility of religion3 is beautiful, but it requires you to fill it up—I
can try, but a few paragraphs will bring me to the end of all I have got
to say on the subject. What would be the use of my outliving you! I
could write nothing worth keeping alive for except with your prompting.
As to the Life4—which I have been revising & correcting—the greater
part, in bulk, of what is written consists of the history of my mind up
to the time when your influence over it Edition: current; Page: [166]
began—& I do not think there can be much objectionable in that part,
even including as it does, sketches of the character of most of the
people I was intimate with—if I could be said to be so with any one. I
quite agree in the sort of résumé of our relationship which you
suggest5—but if it is to be only as you say a dozen lines, or even three
or four dozen, could you not my own love write it out your darling self
& send it in one of your precious letters—It is one of the many things
of which the fond would be much better laid by you & we can add to it
afterwards if we see occasion. I sent the Examiner today. I am so sorry
& ashamed of the spots of grease on it. The chapter of the P.E.6 I shall
send by the post which takes this letter. If the post office tells me
right, a penny stamp will cover it & you will have nothing to pay. I do
not know where to begin or where to stop in attempting to improve it.
One would like to write a treatise instead. As for minor additions, I
wish I could get some more recent facts as to the French Associations
Ouvrières.7 I must also say something about the English ones (though a
very little will suffice) as Furnivall suggests in another note he has
written to me which I inclose. The note at p. 331 now requires
modification, so far as concerns the first half of it. I shall not
attempt any alterations till I hear from you. I will give your “happy
returns” to Haji tomorrow.8 The last Sunday but one I took occasion in
talking with him to say you were the profoundest thinker & most
consummate reasoner I had ever known—he made no remark to the point but
ejaculated a strong wish that you were back here. He is intensely taken
up with the Russian affair—he always knows the minutest circumstances
about the military operations, or the preparations for war here & in
France—& is continually saying how much he should like to be going to
the Black Sea, to make a naval campaign against Russia &c. He has none
of the feelings now apparently either physical or moral, of an invalid—&
I often wonder what has become of his ailments. The invalid bay,
darling, is in perfect health & looks as well as its opposite neighbour.
I hope the dear palms will not permanently suffer, or the olives either.
I have made Sharpers send a bill of which this is a copy:

I received your Sunday’s letter dearest yesterday (Thursday) & meant to
have written yesterday evening but I was tired, fell asleep in my chair,
slept a long time & woke feeling unfit for anything but going to bed—the
first time since my return that any similar thing has happened, for
though I sometimes feel sleepy & doze directly after dinner, it never
lasts many minutes. I know nothing to account for it, nor had I had
anything particular to tire me yesterday. Your letter thank heaven
contains much more of good than bad about your health—the bad is the
weakness but though I ardently desire to hear that you are stronger I do
not expect it till summer. Your having much less cough & uneasiness in
the chest makes me think less about the weakness—one’s strength varies
so very much with little apparent cause when once one is in delicate
health—& I think one is always weaker at the end of winter—you,
especially, always are, & no doubt winter is winter Edition: current;
Page: [168] even at Hyères. I too am considerably less strong, or feel
so at least, than I did at Nice, but I do not think that proves
anything, nor am I sure that it would not turn out to be chiefly nervous
weakness which would go off in a day’s walk, or a journey, or anything
else which would increase real weakness. Altogether I hope the best for
both of us, & see nothing in the state of either to discourage the hope.
I hope we shall live to write together “all we wish to leave written” to
most of which your living is quite as essential as mine, for even if the
wreck I should be could work on with undiminished faculties, my
faculties at the best are not adequate to the highest subjects & have
already done almost the best they are adequate to. Do not think darling
that I should ever make this an excuse to myself for not doing my very
best—if I survived you, & anything we much care about was not already
fixed in writing, you might depend on my attempting all of it & doing my
very best to make it such as you would wish, for my only rule of life
then would be what I thought you would wish as it now is what you tell
me you wish. But I am not fit to write on anything but the outskirts of
the great questions of feeling & life without you to prompt me as well
as to keep me right. So we must do what we can while we are alive—the
Life being the first thing—which independent of the personal matters
which it will set right when we have made it what we intend, is even now
an unreserved proclamation of our opinions on religion, nature, & much
else. About that long journey—I shall not dread it so much for you if
the cough goes quite or nearly quite off, which it is very likely to do,
though no doubt there will always be much danger of its returning. It is
quite possible that the journey may give strength instead of taking it
away; most likely so, if the weakness is as I hope, chiefly nervous. It
is a curious coincidence that the same day I received your letter in
which you speak of Sykes’ return, he made his appearance. He just
mentioned Emilia as regretting that she had not earlier information of
your being at Nice (the humbug!) This he said among other things in a
manner not requiring that I should take any notice of it which
accordingly I did not. He seemed to think he had more need to apologize
to me than I to him. His enquiries about your health I answered as you
desired—“pretty well, but not strong.” It appeared he had heard about us
from Gurney & no doubt heard all that gossiping creature had to say—the
only thing he mentioned was that G. had been called in “at the eleventh
hour”—it is very lucky it was not the twelfth. Sykes’ account shews that
the return of cold weather which you have had has been general, & worse
in France than here. At Bourges he said 12 degr centigrade below
freezing & at Paris 4 degr I think he said: he did get to Châlons by the
steamboat, but it was stopped by the ice the day after. Here it was
cold, but nothing comparable to that as indeed our insular cold seldom
is. I was amused with myself for what I wrote about the appointments,2
when I read your comment. Edition: current; Page: [169] When I go next
to C.3 which will probably be on Tuesday I will put on an old linen
shirt. The flannels were from Brier’s, but I will get some from Capper’s
today or tomorrow4 & will discard the second flannel though I am sure C.
meant it quite seriously. Whatever danger I am in of consumption is not
I think from general weak health as I am not sufficiently out of order
for that, but specifically from the cough, connected as it is with
congestion of the lungs which if long continued is always in danger of
ending in consumption. For that reason it seems necessary to have the
chest examined now & then unless the cough goes off. It was not examined
the last time I went. I should like much to know the meaning of that
swelling—had it not gone off before? Is there anything permanent about
it? I too have been blistering for a fortnight past, with no perceptible
result for the cough is rather worse. I subscribed to the anti-newspaper
stamp affair solely out of hostility to the Times.5 If you think it
better not I will not subscribe again—though surely it would be a great
improvement to English working men if they could be made Americans.

Sharpers’ bill of which I sent a copy in my last letter,6 is dated June
1853. The Govt have brought in a useful bill for schools in Scotland7
but Russell, grown as you say dévôt, the other day repeated his
declaration against giving secular education without religion.8

Adieu my own darling love & light of my life, love me always as you do.

I received your precious letter yesterday my beloved—precious always,
but even more so this time than many others because it tells me that you
are Edition: current; Page: [170] better & shews that you are more
hopeful. I put off writing till today as I meant to go to Clark this
morning that I might tell you anything he said. He thinks, from the
indications of the stethoscope and the sounds on percussion, that the
chest is a little better. It is the first time he has thought so, &
though there is no diminution of cough, if he is right, that I suppose
will follow. He thinks my stomach out of order (which is evident) but
that medicine will do it no good—saving a slight tonic which he
prescribed. I did not ask him about physicians at Paris as you told me
not—but his knowledge of my having been at Nice came from me. He asked
how long I had had the cough, & when I told him, he said it was
imprudent to have let it go on so long without advice. I said I had not,
& it was natural & seemed best to shew why I had sought other advice
than his. You will say perhaps it was presumption in him to think or say
that I had no advice because I did not come to him—but he was perhaps
justified by my having gone several times to him on much slighter
indications of chest disorder & by my now coming to him again. How I
came to mention Gurney’s name I do not remember but I was a little
curious to hear what he would say & what would be his judgment between
G. & Travis & the result is that I think his opinion would be an affair
of party. I have been led into writing all this by the mention of Clark.
About our plans, & first our ultimate plans—we are not yet at the £500
certain which you mention,2 but we are past £400: there is the 3 per
cent stock—£141: last year there was from Herbert £43: from railways
there is £175, altogether £359. Then there is above £700 ready to
invest, besides what is in the Comml Bank which I suppose must be at
least £500. We might turn the uninvested & the railway money into a life
annuity, but as the railways give much higher interest than the common
rate, I suppose we should not much increase the income by that. £1200
invested in railways at the present prices would yield not much less
than 5 per cent or £60. That gives nearly £420, & we should add
something more if we keep to the I.H. for this year, which it will
probably be well to do in any case since my health during that time will
probably decide not only on my getting next winter abroad but probably
on the likelihood of my being able to get a pension. These things being
considered you will understand why Clark’s more favourable opinion this
morning was quite as disagreeable to me as agreeable. With regard to
your coming over, especially with the prospect of a second crossing in
autumn, but even without that, I dread it so much that I hardly allow
myself to wish it—but when we meet at Paris there will be much greater
means of judging—If as I hope the malady has now taken the turn, you
will probably be much better then than now. I am very much afraid of
your encountering the great cold of the centre Edition: current; Page:
[171] & north of France too soon. It seems to me much too soon to leave
Hyères yet, while the place continues to agree with you. The change in
the direction is the 12th of April, the Wednesday before Good Friday—but
Easter really makes no difference as to getting away unless when it is
for three or four days only—& though to get away after the change of
directors is much easier than before it, the going immediately after has
no advantage quoad I.H. but rather the contrary. I have been reading a
little book which I remember seeing advertised years ago but did not get
it supposing it to be some merely quackish thing, but an edition having
been readvertised just now I got it—called The Curability of
Consumption, by Dr Ramadge3 & it is not a quackish thing at all—the
writer is evidently well entitled to an opinion having been Senior
Physician to the Infirmary for diseases of the Chest. I wish I had seen
the book long ago—I certainly think any person would be very foolish to
let themselves die of consumption without having tried him & his
treatment, the chief peculiarity of which consists in breathing (during
a small part of every day) through a tube so constructed as to prolong
the expiratory movement. The number & quality of the cases of success
which he cites, even in an advanced stage of consumption, are such as
quite entitle him to a trial. His theory seems only one step in
extension of the now generally received theory. He says: It is admitted
that if by any means the formation of fresh tubercles could be stopped,
those already formed would either continue inert or would soften & be
discharged & the cavities left would probably be cicatrized. Now the
reason why the formation of fresh tubercles is so seldom stopped is that
as soon as there is much disease, the lungs & chest contract, & in
proportion to the contraction the tendency is stronger to form fresh
tubercles—& this goes on in an augmenting ratio, for when the lungs are
of less dimensions while the air passages remain of the same, letting
the air rapidly out, the expanding power is still further diminished.
Therefore if by artificial means the air could be kept longer in, & the
expansion prolonged the best chance is afforded of stopping the progress
of the disease. He has combined very ingeniously a number of curious
facts (if they are facts) in support of this theory—which seems at least
as good as any other medical theory. If he is right, a cold or cough not
originating in pthisis, instead of leading to it, is a protection
against it—which is the most paradoxical part of his doctrine. I will
bring the pamphlet with me to Paris—I am sure it should be at least read
by every one who either has or is threatened with consumption. I sent
the letter to the Frenchman4 darling & am so glad you liked it—I knew
you would alter the ending & improve it. I adopted Edition: current;
Page: [172] “considération amicale”. I liked “sincère” best but doubted
if it was French—i.e. doubted if “considération” sufficiently included
in itself the sense of favourable, without some epithet added to express
it—which sincère does not—but it is only a doubt & has almost vanished
on subsequent “consideration”. Atterer is to throw down on the earth, à
terre—as in Danton’s famous “Pour les vaincre—pour les atterrer—que
faut-il? De l’audace—et encore de l’audace—et toujours de l’audace.”5
Houblon is hops. The garden shall be attended to exactly as you say—I
have written out the instructions to Malyon6 & shall speak to his man
besides. The sticks are in their place in the corner, but whether all or
only part I do not know. See how I go from one subject to another by the
stepping stone of some accidental association—from the French of my
letter to the French words & from hops to the garden. About the article
on India7 I feel quite decided to give it up but must take some time to
concoct a good letter. You have by this time got the chapter8—As so much
is said of the French associations I must put in a few words about the
English, of which Furnivall has sent me a long list, especially as it is
going among the very people—but I shall take care not to commit myself
to anything complimentary to them. F. has also from Nadaud9 some later
intelligence about the French, nearly all of which are put down. & now
my own love my own dearest love farewell.

[P.S.] There is a bill of 1/10 from one Price10 for mending the butter
stand & for a fruit bottle. I suppose it is right.

TO THE CHAIRMEN OF THE LIBRARY COMMITTEES, SOUTH CAROLINA1

3rd March 1854.

Gentlemen,—

A long absence from England2 has made me thus tardy in offering my
acknowledgements to you and to the honourable bodies over Edition:
current; Page: [173] which you preside for having included me among
those to whom, under the resolution of the legislature of South
Carolina,3 you have presented copies of the posthumous work of Mr.
Calhoun.4

Few things can be done by the legislature of any people more commendable
than printing and circulating the writings of their eminent men, and the
present is one of the many examples tending to show that the parsimony
imputed to the republics of the American Union is aversion to useless,
but not to useful, expense. I am one of those who believe that America
is destined to give instruction to the world, not only practically, as
she has long done, but in speculation also; and my opinion is confirmed
by the treatise which I have had the honour of receiving from you, and
which, though I am far from agreeing with it on all points, I consider
to be a really valuable contribution to the science of government.

With the warmest good wishes for the continued progress of the United
States, and hopes that they may lead the way to mental and moral, as
they have already done to much political freedom, I have the honour to
be, gentlemen, your most obedient servant,

J. S. Mill

Your Monday’s letter which has just come, my own adored, gives me the
greatest happiness because it contains by far the best account of your
health I have yet had. The cough evidently going away & your being
stronger, together with there being no expectoration, constitute such an
improvement in all the alarming symptoms as puts me at ease on the
subject of present danger, & though I know it does not amount to proof
that there is no organic disease, it seems to me conclusive so far, that
if there is, it is as in the case of those two in Australia,2 the
variety which is not, under proper precautions, fatal. I have always
thought that if you ever had consumption it would probably be of this
type, as well as that if I ever had it, it would be of the common type &
therefore mortal—unless Ramadge’s plan3 should cure it. Edition:
current; Page: [174] His notion is very consoling, for he is of opinion
that half the people who go about, in good health, either have, or have
had, tubercles in the lungs. Of course the strong ground we now have for
believing that you can live in good health at all events on the
Continent adds a great weight to the side of our giving up England. The
pros & cons of that however we will discuss fully when we meet. As to
the more immediately pressing point of when that should be—what you say
of Directors &c going away at Easter might make a difference in other
years, but I think not in this, for as it will be just the very
beginning of the new system4 with the diminished numbers of the Court &
the three Government nominees for colleagues I expect they will all wait
to see what the new system looks like. What you say however of the
convenience of Easter for our being much alone is a very strong reason
indeed, & I do not see why the double plan you say you would prefer,
should not be possible, since the second absence, if you return with me,
need not, if we have fine weather for crossing, be longer than three or
four days. If you do not return with me, the second visit can be put off
till a little later—& on that supposition the earlier the first visit,
the earlier also can be the second. Against these reasons is one very
strong one that I dread the weather for you if you start so soon as the
20th March—The centre & north of France are so much colder than England.
Here for some days past it is splendid weather for those in perfect
health—not a cloud either by day or night, & the air the most
transparent it ever is in England—March clearness without your plague of
March dust; but sharp frost every night, ice on the ponds & white frost
covering every thing, though the wind was south or south west—& now it
is S. East & in consequence last night was much colder still. I fear
your encountering anything like this, notwithstanding Ramadge’s paradox
of the preservative effect of catching cold. It seems to me clear that
the mildness of Hyères has abated all your chest symptoms (though the
warmth of January may have produced the weakness & want of appetite) & I
should dread their coming on again by travelling in March. This part of
the question however you can best judge of. About my own health there is
nothing new. The cough is not at all better. Clark advised a blister on
the left side of the chest, as the right side, which was the worst
before, is now according to him rather the best of the two. I shall do
it as perhaps the former blistering did the good which he says has been
done: but I postpone it till Saturday night that I may keep the blister
on all Sunday (as I did the former) for blisters act so very mildly on
me that unless I keep them on 24 hours they are hardly of any use. There
is not much new in public affairs. The parliamentary reform, it seems to
be thought, will be put off for this year,5 the public, it is said,
being too much occupied with war prospects to give it the support
necessary for Edition: current; Page: [175] its passing. I do not think
however that in any case there would have been any strong public feeling
for it. It will not sufficiently alter the distribution of power to
excite any strong desire for its passing. The Civil Service examination
plan6 I am afraid is too good to pass. The report proposing it, by
Trevelyan7 & Northcote8 (written no doubt by Trevelyan) has been printed
in the Chronicle9—it is as direct, uncompromising & to the point,
without reservation, as if we had written it. But even the Chronicle
attacks the plan.10 The grand complaint is that it will bring low people
into the offices! as, of course, gentlemen’s sons cannot be expected to
be as clever as low people. It is ominous too that the Times has said
nothing on the subject lately. I should like to know who wrote the
articles in the Times11 in support of the plan—possibly Trevelyan
himself. It was somebody who saw his way to the moral & social ultimate
effects of such a change. How truly you judge people, how true is what
you always say that this ministry are before the public. There has been
a renewal of the anti nunnery stuff12 in Parlt, & ministers again
outvoted—& an inquiry ordered—the applicability of all the arguments to
marriage, & the naif unconsciousness of the speakers, were quite funny.
One said, a vow of obedience was contrary to the British Constn & a
violation of the right everyone has (he did not even say every man) to
personal freedom.13 Another inveighed against allowing young women under
age to bind themselves irrevocably to they knew not what.14 It is for
the purpose of putting in a telling word on such occasions that it would
be pleasant to be in Parlt.—Did you see that Sir John Bowring15 is
appointed Governor of Hong Kong & chief authority in China, & has just
gone out, with Lady Bowring & two daughters? Your “much” is a great
improvement in the letter to the Americans.16 I thought it would have
needed “much” more Edition: current; Page: [176] alteration. I will now
send it. The gardener came for the first time yesterday. He has put in
the peas & covered them over with sticks. He was quite docile about the
lime. Everything else shall be done as you say. Adieu with the utmost
love.

You received the 200 f. & 100 f. notes?

I have your Thursday’s letter today dearest so that it has come quick.
The Pol. Ec. was put into the post 21 Feb. being Tuesday, instead of
Monday, the day I wrote2—the reason being that Parker did not send it
till I was just leaving the I.H. at near five oclock, & as I had no
other copy I wished to read it quietly at home before sending it. It
certainly dear was very wrong to read it without making that sentence
illegible,3 for it was wrong to run any risk of that kind—the risk
happily was small, as they were not likely to take the trouble of
looking into letters or packets addressed to unsuspected persons, nor if
they did were they likely to see that sentence, nor if they saw it to
make the receiver answerable for a sentence in a printed paper forming
part of an English book. Still it was a piece of criminal rashness which
might have done mischief though it probably has not. Did it arrive with
a penny stamp, attached half to the cover & half to the blank page, so
as to be a sort of cachet? If it did not, however, it would not prove it
to have been opened, as the stamp might come off. It was another piece
of thoughtlessness not to say that I had no other copy. It is, however,
probable, though not certain, that I could get another from Parker & I
would have applied to him for one now if you had said that you would not
send yours until you receive this; but as you will probably have sent it
after receiving my next letter, & it is therefore probably on its way, I
will wait to see. I quite agree with you about the inexpediency of
adding anything like practical advice, or anything at all which alters
the character of the chapter—the working men ought to see that it was
not written for them—any attempt to mingle the two characters would be
sure to be a failure & is not the way in which we should do the Edition:
current; Page: [177] thing even if we had plenty of time & were
together. This morning has come from Chapman4 a proposal for reprinting
the article Enfranchisement of Women5 or as he vulgarly calls it the
article on Woman. How very vulgar all his notes are. I am glad however
that it is your permission he asks. I hope the lady friend6 is not H.
Martineau. Mrs Gaskell7 perhaps? you will tell me what to say. I do not
remember my darling, what I wrote that could make you uneasy about my
health—but Tuesday’s letter will have told you that in Clark’s opinion I
am better; & I am certainly better since I saw Clark, for since I took
his tonic dinner pill (nux vomica) I have ceased to have the daily
slight indigestion, in the form of acidity, which I used to have before.
I have little now which shews stomach derangement except a white tongue,
& sensations of dryness in the tongue & throat; and both these symptoms
vary very much in degree. The cough is just at present better than it
has been lately but not better than it has often been. I find no
progressive improvement but I quite as much wish not to find it, as to
find it. The expectoration is more marked than the cough as is to be
expected since there is as we know a general tendency in me to excess of
that mucous secretion—there is so much of it that there is generally no
choice but between spitting it up & swallowing it. As to the time of our
meeting I have not much additional to say. It is now much colder here,
to the sensations at least, than when I last wrote; with north east wind
& fog, & I fear it is likely to be very cold in France, but all this may
change by the time you think of moving. With respect to the carriage,
since so little would be got for it, what do you think of leaving it en
remise with the Univers man at Lyons or with somebody at Châlon? If we
go abroad next winter either for a permanency or for the season, which
we are pretty sure to do, (apart from the possibility of your not
crossing this year at all) it will be agreeable & even a saving to have
the carriage which we know & like to take us to the South, & we are
almost sure to go by that railway. The man might be paid two or three
months in advance or six if necessary. I only throw this out as a
suggestion.—On Wednesday the directors & ex directors meet to do
execution on themselves.8 The 15 they have to select out of 29, with the
addition of three nominees of Govt, will form the new Court of Directors
from the 12th of April. Only three have declined being reelected, & two
of those three would have had a good chance. I have not seen Sykes
again—being out by rotation he does not come to the I.H. often.—On
Saturday I completely Edition: current; Page: [178] finished the arrear
of work here, so that I have done in two months the work of 5½. It is
true I have generally remained till near five o’clock & have worked two
Sundays at home—likewise that I never remember such light mails as they
have been of late. I have also by no means got the two months work off
my hands, as great part of it still wants my help to push it through the
subsequent stages. Still you see how easily they could get their work
done giving me any amount of leave of absence. True I have had no waste
of time with Ellice & Oliphant,9 as I can do what I please with
them—they generally read & pass on what I write & I have not even to see
them—while with Hogg10 half my time was spent in explaining, defending,
& altering so as to spoil it as little as I could. I have fairly set to
at another essay, on the subject you suggested.11 I wrote several hours
at it yesterday, after turning it over mentally many days before—but I
cannot work at it here yet, as there is another mail in today—luckily a
light one. Wright & Sharpers12 are paid. Adieu my sweetest & dearest.

I have not waited till now to make myself acquainted with the Report2
which you have done me the favour of sending to me, and to hail the plan
of throwing open the civil service to competition as one of the greatest
improvements in public affairs ever proposed by a government. If the
examination be so contrived as to be a real test of mental superiority,
it is difficult to set limits to the effect which will be produced in
raising the character not only of the public service but of Society
itself. I shall be most happy to express this opinion in any way in
which you think it can be of the smallest use towards helping forward so
noble a scheme, but as the successful working of the plan will depend
principally on details into which very properly your Report does not
enter, I should be unable without some time for consideration, to write
Edition: current; Page: [179] anything which could have a chance of
being of any service in the way of suggestion.3

I am sorry to say you are mistaken in supposing that anything bearing
the remotest resemblance to what you propose, exists at the I.H. It will
exist in the India Civil Service by the Act of last year.4

I have received your Sunday’s letter today darling, the first almost
that has been directed in your own dear handwriting—I hail it as a good
augury. I do not think darling that you need be uneasy about my cough.
It is not what anyone would call much—it is even very little were not
the mucous secretion so much more than in proportion to it—the principal
inconvenience of it is that it is a hindrance to much talking, or
reading aloud. I do not think it ever permanently gets worse. I may very
likely have it a long while, perhaps always, & without its turning to
consumption, for I am more & more convinced that consumption is a
constitutional & not a local disease, at all events “doctored into a
consumption” I will not be. I have been coming to much the same
conclusion as yours about going to Clark. I never meant to continue
indefinitely consulting him—I have his opinion now that tonics are the
thing for my stomach & I can manage those myself. I should not go to him
any more at all for the sake of anything he can prescribe, but because I
feel confidence in his knowledge of the signs of chest disease, & while
there seems any liability to consumption it is good to find out now &
then whether one is drifting towards it or away from it. All you say
about conduct in relation to him I most certainly agree in. About the
time of our meeting you, dearest, are the best judge. I mentioned in one
of my letters that I think the double going to Paris might be managed if
really best. Unless you are mistaken about the notes which is very
unlikely, a 200 fr. note has been stolen—I have sent in all 1200 fr. The
last 500 fr. I sent in two letters: the first, containing a 200 fr. note
you acknowledged—in the very next letter after that, I enclosed another
200 fr. & a 100 fr. of which it would appear that you received only the
100, yet I feel sure that I mentioned both in the letter following, but
it does not become me to feel sure of anything, especially after I have
found Edition: current; Page: [180] the will which I thought I had given
to you,2 & found it in my desk at the I.H. with the Bramahlock,3 which I
thought I had effectually searched & in which I thought it had never
been. It is vexatious if the note is stolen—curious too that they did
not take both notes. In any case I shall get another & send it. About
the P[olitical] E[conomy] I shall write immediately to Parker for
another copy. I do not intend to say anything in praise of the English
associations but solely to state the fact that they are now very
numerous & increasing—perhaps stating how many, according to a list
which F[urnivall] gave me. Whatever I do write I will send you & it will
cause no or but little delay as the thing can go to press meanwhile &
alterations be made when it is in proof. The two inclosures I now send
are very unlike that & one another. Powell’s4 note is rather
embarrassing especially as I have not the key of the outhouse. I see two
large holes, one of them going right under the wall & connecting the two
premises. Kate says she never saw a rat till Monday when she saw one
after Powell’s ratcatcher had driven them or made them, as he says,
“retreat” to our side & established there, probably, the populous colony
he complains of. You will tell me what is to be done. I wrote a note &
made Haji leave it, in these words “Mr J. S. Mill is obliged to Mr
Powell for his information & will have his side of the garden wall
examined”: that seemed safe & uncommitting. The other note is from
Trevelyan & is an appeal that I ought to respond to, but it will be
difficult, & without you impossible, to write the opinion he asks for,
so as to be fit to print. But he ought to be helped, for the scheme is
the greatest thing yet proposed in the way of real reform & his report
is as I said before,5 almost as if we had written it. I wish it were
possible to delay even answering his note till I could send the draft to
you & receive it back but I fear that would not do. As for news in the
first place the income tax is to be doubled, for half a year only at
present, but with every prospect of the same in the next half year &
until the war ends.6 Secondly the election of directors has been made, &
is generally good.7 They have only retained one (Astell) whom they
decidedly should have rejected, & Edition: current; Page: [181] only
rejected one (Cotton) whom they decidedly should have elected. Sykes &
Eastwick, those I cared most about of the doubtful ones, are elected.
Hogg has got in—the rejection of him was too much to hope for—but he has
not been able to keep in his son in law. Bayley, Mangles, Prinsep,
Shepherd, Ellice, Oliphant, were sure. The remaining five are Willock,
Macnaghten, Leslie Melville, Mills & Martin Smith, the last two elected
mainly because they are of the two great banking houses, but both rather
useful directors. Two other bankers, Masterman the city member, &
Muspratt are turned out—neither of them any loss—also Major Moore, & two
named Dent & Whiteman, all of them some loss. The rest of the rejected
are null or superannuated. I am now afraid lest Hogg should try for the
deputy chair but I hope Mangles will, & will beat him. The gardener has
put in the crops & dug all the middle of the garden & is today cutting
the wall fruit trees—after today I shall not have him till I hear from
you—but the week after next, I think he should dig the borders &
flowerbeds. I wish I could send you some tea—& rain to lay the dust.
Here it is now mild again & very pleasant. Addio con sommo amore.

My darling love I have just received your Tuesday’s letter, so I write
now for the last time to Hyères, dear Hyères—it will always feel like a
home to me, though it is not a place of which we should choose to make
our permanent home. What you say of the dust & what we know of gnats,
shew what all that coast must be except for a very few months of winter.
That is one of the difficulties in our living abroad when part of the
motive is a good winter climate—that the same place would be sure to be
insupportable in summer, so that we require to have the means of
frequent change & also could have no fixed home—as we could have at
Paris or Bonn or Heidelberg if health had not to be considered. It is
wise to take plenty of time for the journey & I should think the 18th
not at all too early if as I suppose, Easter, with L[ily] begins with
Palm Sunday. And there will probably be no reason now against travelling
on account of weather—here it is quite the temperature of advanced
spring—very pleasant but from its suddenness not agreeing well with me,
if Clark is right. You would not suppose from my last letter that
Edition: current; Page: [182] before I wrote again I should have gone
again to Clark—but a new symptom is a reason for going, & mine was,
night perspirations the last two nights—last night every time I dropped
asleep, & this in spite of taking off bedclothes. This being one of the
great indications of consumption (though also of other ailments) it was
well to find out what it meant. Clark thought it was chiefly from the
sudden change of weather & said that almost everybody is complaining of
night perspirations, the queen among others. Whatever he may say, it is
clear to me that no weather would produce any such effect on me if there
were not a strong predisposition to it. He prescribed a different tonic,
dispensing with vinegar & water—which I shall do or not as I like
myself. I was inclined to prescribe walking, & to use the fine weather
for that purpose on Sundays according to your frequent prescription of
more walking which I certainly want, for the pains I consulted Bird
about have all returned. Clark however recommends less instead of more
exertion while this debility lasts, on that too I shall use my own
judgment. I shall perhaps not go to Clark any more at all, unless I find
myself getting worse. I shall write to Avignon darling & I am sorry on
Lily’s account that the post office is a great way from the inns, & in a
very out of the way corner. The inn seemed to me an excellent one—the
best I found in the whole journey—Europe I think it was—I know it was
not the Palais Royal though that also is said to be good. I will send
the Examiner Poste Restante Avignon. You will not care much about it,
but it may just as well go. Lily will like the cathedral & the tombs of
the popes. I inclose now a 200 fr. note. I hope the other may be found
but do not expect it. I inclosed in my Thursday’s letter Powell’s note
about the rats—since then they have made their presence on our side of
the wall very palpable—Kate shewed me this morning that they had in the
night bored a passage under the door between the coal place & the
scullery—& she says they now make a great uproar in the outhouse, of
which I have not the key. As they never shewed themselves before no
doubt Powell’s operations have driven them out of his place into ours. I
do not know what it is best or even possible to do but to leave things
as they are till we meet. How delightful that that will be soon—how much
I shall enjoy hearing from you on the journey—you will tell me at what
places to write to you. Now from my whole heart I pray that you may have
in every sense of the word, the best of all possible journies. If you
are as well as when we travelled from Nice to Hyères I feel no doubt of
its doing you not only no harm but good. How I shall like to think of
you going over the same ground as I did & staying at the same inns—but
you will go I suppose by Aix & not through Toulon or Marseilles. The
country will be much prettier than as I saw it—bleak & frozen in the
south & covered with snow in the north. I have not yet any answer from
Parker to my application for another copy of the chapter. What a
rambling scambling letter. Adieu my adored.

If my dearest one got the short letter I wrote yesterday to Marseilles,2
she knows that I am pained to think of her being uneasy about my health
& that I do not think there is cause to. I have been three nights now
without perspiration except a very little the night before last, though
I did not adopt Clark’s sponging with vinegar & water. I did take his
tonic (much the same as your quinine draught) but not so often as he
said. On Sunday the day was so fine & tempting that I thought I would
try walking so after working till near one at the new essay3 I started
for Eltham & found out the palace4—the approach to it & the ground just
about it are most excessively pretty. I returned by a field path which
joins the high road not far from Lee Lane & so completed the circuit in
the most exquisite day possible in England, wanting only the Nice
blueness & purity of the sky though it was equally cloudless—as it has
been, day & night, though with a south wind, for a week past, till today
when the rain has at last come. I was not at all tired & felt better for
the walk & I shall certainly if weather permits use the remaining
Sundays till we meet, or part of them, in walking, provided I have
worked hard enough in the week to have earned a holiday. I still think
the cough is better, nor have I much sign of stomach derangement except
the white & dry tongue—the dryness I suspect has something to do with
the too great mucous secretion lower down. The pains in the limbs &c.
are also better—for them, & all stomach symptoms I am convinced walking
is the best remedy. I do not think I mentioned the pains to Clark, or my
having consulted Coulson & Bird, but it would perhaps as you say be
right to do so. If C. thinks I require change of circumstances &
especially treatment for chronic indigestion, the chances are that he
would recommend a German watering place in the summer, which would not
answer our purpose nearly so well as a winter abroad & would probably be
incompatible with it unless we give up England this autumn. I do not
think he thinks my lungs even threatened—it was only congestion he found
on either side & very little of that. I have written at so much length
to my dear one about my health not because I am thinking or feeling
about it but because she is. To speak of pleasanter things, I need
hardly say how heartily I feel all you say about the civil service plan5
& the contempt I feel for the little feeling shewn for it, not to speak
of actual Edition: current; Page: [184] hostility. I give the ministers
infinite credit for it—that is if they really adopt the whole plan, for
as their bill is not yet brought in6 (it is not as you seem to think,
part of the Reform Bill) we do not yet know how far they will really go;
but the least they can do consistently with their speeches, will be such
a sacrifice of the power of jobbing as hardly a politician who ever
lived, ever yet made to the sense of right, without any public demand—it
stamps them as quite remarkable men for their class & country—Of course
all the jobbers are loud against them, especially newspaper editors who
all now look out for places. Yet I so share your misgiving that they
cannot know how great a thing they are doing, that I am really afraid to
say all I feel about it till they are fully committed, lest it should do
more harm than good. This was my answer to Trevelyan . . . [Here he
quotes Letter 141].

Trevelyan’s answer: “You have done us a great service by the expression
of your decided approbation of our plan for the reform of the English
Civil Establishments; & as it is well known that you do not form your
opinions lightly, I do not wish to trouble you to enter upon the details
of the subject at present. If you can suggest any improvement in the
more advanced stages, we shall hope to hear from you again.” This looks
as if he desired support more than criticism, but it is useful as it
opens a channel by which, without obtrusiveness, we may write anything
we like in the way of comment on the bill hereafter & be sure of its
being read by the government. They have already quoted me in favour of
the plan—last night a discussion was raised about it by that true
Irishman Lord Monteagle in the H. of Lords, who attacked it,7 but it was
defended with real spirit & vigour by two Cabinet Ministers, Lord
Granville8 & the D. of Argyle9 the former of whom mentioned as approving
of it, along with Stephen10 & some others, “Mr J. Mill of the India
House who is an able administrator as well as a philosophic writer”,
that is the Times report.11 It is evident they are always glad to have
me to quote, & we must give them plenty to quote for. By the bye, the
writer Edition: current; Page: [185] of one of the leading articles in
today’s Morning Post12 had evidently come hot from reading the Logic, &
I am sorry to say did it no credit as a pupil for it was an article
against the Jew bill.13—I find a good deal of difficulty in adding much
to the chapter of the P. Econ.14 without altering its character, which
must be maintained, in the main, as it is, as something written of but
not to the working classes. I think I agree in all your remarks & have
adopted them almost all—but I do not see the possibility of bringing in
the first two pages (from the preceding chapter)15—I see no place which
they would fit. Not having your copy, I do not know what sentence you
would omit from page 330.16 I do not see how to bring in anything about
short hours bills well; does it seem necessary to do so here?—& I have
not yet succeeded in bringing in your remark on page 346.17 I have
translated (with some omissions) all the French.18 I give on the next
page all the additions I have made.19 If I make any more I will send
them. I shall keep it back from Furnivall for a few days—if he is not
urgent, till I hear from you.—While I am writing, in comes a German
socialist20 with an introduction from Courcelle Seneuil shewing that he
had not received my letter,21 & that he has changed his address. This is
a bore, as it necessitates writing to him again. He also says he sent a
copy of the Translation of the Pol. Ec.22 but it has not arrived. I must
ask at Delizy’s for it. I found the other day to my consternation that
among bookseller’s catalogues & other printed things which I found on
arrival & had thrown by unopened, I had overlooked an application from
the Commissioners for enquiring into the law of partnership23 asking if
I still retained my opinions on limited liability & sending a long list
of elaborately framed questions to be filled up with answers. I wrote
apologizing for the delay, saying I was still of the same opinion &
referring them to my evidence24 as containing all I had to say, excusing
myself therefore from answering the questions (some of which would have
given me a Edition: current; Page: [186] great deal of trouble to answer
& would not have been worth it). Yesterday I had their reply saying that
my opinions would be taken into consideration (I suppose the official
form). By the time my darling receives this she will have had three (or
four?) day’s journey25 & will be able to judge how she is able to bear
it. I have been trying to make out what her stopping places will be but
cannot do so satisfactorily. I suppose she will rest a little at the old
city of the popes especially if the inn is as good as it seemed to me.26
How I long to hear from her on the journey, but I shall have two or
three darling letters from the dear old place first. I shall always love
Hyères because we have been there together as I feel us here all this
time, & she has got better there. Adieu—à tous les dieux.

Additional note, in brackets, to p. 33127

[Mr Fitzroy’s Act for the better protection of women & children against
assaults, is a well meant though inadequate attempt to remove the first
reproach. The second is more flagrant than ever, another Reform Bill
having been presented this year, which largely extends the franchise
among many classes of men, but leaves all women in their existing state
of political as well as social servitude.]

Page 332 near the bottom.28 “The rich in their turn are regarded as a
mere prey & pasture for the poor & are the subject of demands &
expectations wholly indefinite, increasing in extent with every
concession made to them. The total absence of regard for justice or
fairness in the relations between the two, is at the least as marked on
the side of the employed as on that of the employers. We look in vain
among the working classes for the just pride which will choose to give
good work for good wages: for the most part their sole endeavour is to
receive as much, & return as little in the shape of service, as
possible.”

Page 346, continuation of note.29 “One of the most discreditable
indications of a low moral condition, given of late by the English
working classes, is the opposition to piece work. Dislike to piecework,
except under mistaken notions, must be dislike to justice and fairness;
or desire to cheat, by not giving work in proportion to the pay.
Piecework is the perfection of contract; & contract, in all work, & in
the most minute detail—the principle of so much pay for so much service
carried to the utmost extremity—is the system, of all others, in the
present state of society, most favorable to the worker, though most
unfavorable to the non-worker who wishes to be paid for being idle.”

Edition: current; Page: [187]
Note to p. 347.30 “According to the latest accounts which have reached
us (March 1854) seven of these associations are all which are now left.
But Cooperative stores (associations pour la consommation) have greatly
developed themselves, especially in the S. of France, & are at least not
forbidden (we know not whether discouraged) by the Government.”

Note to p. 348.31 “Though this beneficent movement has been so fatally
checked in the country in which it originated, it is rapidly spreading
in those other countries which have acquired, & still retain, any
political freedom. It forms already an important feature in the social
improvement which is proceeding at a most rapid pace in Piedmont: & in
England on the 15th of Feb. of the present year 1854 there had been
registered under the Ind[ustrial] & Prov[ident] Societies Act, 33
associations, 17 of which are Industrial Societies, the remainder being
associations for cooperative consumption only. This does not include
Scotland where also these assns are rapidly multiplying. The Societies
which have registered under this new Act are only a portion of the
whole. A list dated in June 1852 gives 41 assns for productive industry
in E. & Sc. besides a very much greater number of flour mill societies &
cooperative stores.”

Your Thursday’s letter my own darling love, has just come. As you expect
to be at Lyons on the 24th or 25th or at least wish the letter to be
sure of being there at that time, I do not like to write later than
today. I hope you got my short letter to Marseilles & my long one to
Avignon. They were written in the expectation of your not being there so
soon as you now say—but still they would be, I think, in time. I sent
the letter to Marseilles on the 13th, & that to Avignon on the 14th,
having written my last letter to Hyères (which inclosed 200 fr.) on the
11th. You will have seen by my Avignon letter that Trevelyan does not
want, at least for the present, anything more from me than he has got,
namely a warm expression of approval with a readiness to write at
greater length in defence & commendation of the plan—& also that they
have already cited my approval in Parliament. However Trevelyan’s
Edition: current; Page: [188] second note, of which I sent you a copy,
leaves a complete opening for sending as you say a review of the report.
I fear from the strong feeling my darling shews on the matter that she
will be disappointed, but even if she had been here I do not think we
could have kept him without any answer to his note till the complete
review was ready, & if so the first answer however short must have
expressed the warm approbation mine did.—My letter to Avignon also
contained copies of all the new matter of any importance in the Chapter
of the Pol. Ec. & asked what was the sentence in page 330 that you had
marked to come out—but the chapter itself has arrived since & there is
no sentence marked in that page. I suppose the dear one altered her mind
& rubbed out the marks. I still hold to keeping it back from Furnivall
till I hear your opinion of the additional matter which will be in a few
days now. I am so sorry the few words I wrote to Powell2 vexed her—I was
much annoyed at having to write or do anything in such a matter without
having time to consult her for I know I always miss the proper thing &
above all the proper tone. I shall now do at once what my dearest one
recommends, that is her last recommendation. I shall make Marshall send
to pick the lock of the outhouse, & shall write to Powell exactly as she
says, & then send for his ratcatcher. The clock that is broken is the
one in the kitchen & I shall get Kate to ask Verney’s man to send some
one as you suggest & I will take care that the gardener only hoes the
flowerbeds. Russell has today brought in his bill for the reform of the
University of Oxford:3 it will if carried make what will be thought a
great change & in every thing which it touches the change will be for
the better—but nothing will make a Church of England university a good
place of education, except comparatively. The bill for the civil service
is not yet brought in4—but I quite expect that it will go the full
length of the report, that is, to make the competition for the first
admission into a public office open to every young man between certain
ages, without any previous nomination.—It is not proposed that promotion
in the offices, or the admission of persons not already in the service
to any of the higher situations, should go by competition—& indeed there
would be much difficulty in managing that—for instance I hardly know
what examination would shew the fittest person for an office like mine
at the I.H. Seniority however is no longer to be the ground of promotion
to offices requiring talent, & there is an attempt to make merit the
sole ground of promotion—the thing most relied on however being that as
the clerks &c will no longer be protégés of the heads of offices or of
their political or other friends there will be much less motive to favor
them for other Edition: current; Page: [189] reasons than merit than
there now is. This is the very day she leaves Hyères, the blessed one. I
hope (& feel sure) it is a very different day there from here, where it
is most gloomily raining, though the morning was fine. The last two days
have been bright & much colder with northerly winds, but today the wind
is again south. I am truly happy that she is coming nearer. I look
forward with the greatest interest to hearing from her on the route & am
sorry I cannot write again till I write to Paris. Writing to her is the
next greatest pleasure to hearing from her. Since I wrote last the cough
& expectoration have been worse, then better again. There is very little
cough, the expectoration is much the more prominent of the two. There is
now however, I certainly think, less of that in quantity—but there was
again a little blood this morning. I feel much less than my usual
strength these two or three days, probably from some temporary cause
(though I am taking quinine) not weaker however than I have several
times felt when nothing seriously ailed me. Clark says I do not lose
flesh, & that is also my own opinion.—I wrote another letter to
Courcelle Seneuil telling him about the first5 & saying over again much
more briefly what it said. Adieu my own—no words can tell how precious
one.

I wrote to my precious one at Lyons on Saturday 18th foolishly thinking
that it would be too late to write today—but Lyons is so much nearer
than Hyères especially counting the railway, that I shall be quite safe
in writing today: & it is the more necessary I should do so as I
stupidly said nothing on Saturday about so important & interesting a
matter as Chapman’s proposal.2 Because the letter in which you spoke of
it was not the last letter but the one before, I fancied I had answered
it already, & only on thinking yesterday discovered that I had not. I
sent to Chapman the letter you drafted, exactly as it was, only choosing
the phrases I preferred where you gave the choice of two. I think that
to refuse was best, on the whole, for I should not like any more than
you that that paper should be supposed to be the best we could do, or
the real expression of our mind on the subject. This is not supposed of
a mere review article written on a special occasion as that was, but
would Edition: current; Page: [190] perhaps be so if the same thing were
put out, years after, under our own auspices as a pamphlet. I only wish
the better thing we have promised to write were already written instead
of being in prospect.3 In any case the article will of course be in any
collection4 or rather selection of articles which we may either publish
in our life, or leave for publication afterwards, & whichever we do it
shall be preceded by a preface which will shew that much of all my later
articles, & all the best of that one, were, as they were, my Darling’s.
That creature Dickens, whose last story, Bleak House,5 I found
accidentally at the London Library the other day & took home & read—much
the worst of his things, & the only one of them I altogether dislike—has
the vulgar impudence in this thing to ridicule rights of women. It is
done too in the very vulgarest way—just the stile in which vulgar men
used to ridicule “learned ladies” as neglecting their children &
household &c.6 I wrote a good spell at the new Essay7 yesterday, & hope
to get a good deal done to it this week. But I have not yet got to the
part of the subject which you so beautifully sketched, having begun with
examining the more commonplace view of the subject, the supposed
necessity of religion for social purposes as a sanction for morality. I
regard the whole of what I am writing or shall write as mere raw
material, in what manner & into what to be worked up to be decided
between us—& I am much bent upon getting as much of this sort written as
possible—but above all I am anxious about the Life, which must be the
first thing we go over when we are together. I did not get a walk
yesterday as I hoped to have done—instead of the delightful warm
sunshine of last Sunday it was a violent cold east wind with frequent
heavy showers. If it had been fine I think a walk would have done me
good, though I do not feel strong enough to attempt a long one. I do not
expect to get any more good from Clark, but have a very great
inclination to see Ramadge—though not unless you darling approve. I wish
you could see his book.8 I wrote to you what I thought of it—& seeing
him does not necessarily imply following his advice. Though his book is
specially on consumption, it shews much experience in, & I should think
understanding of, chest complaints in general. Be sure my angel when you
write to tell me how you are in every respect. You have not told me
lately. How I long to see you & be with you, my beloved.

Dear Sir

I am sorry to have kept these sheets2 so long, and to return them now
with so few additions and improvements. But after much turning over the
subject in my mind, I find that to say the things I wished to say, in
such a manner as to be of any use, would alter the whole plan and
character of the chapter, which being written of but not to the working
classes, had better be read by them with that understanding, and is
unfit to form a good foundation for a direct appeal to the working
classes themselves. I have therefore made only the alterations which I
think indispensable—and I shall be happy if, such as it is, its
republication should do any of the good you hope from it.

I write this my own darling, because from her Dijon letter received
today I am afraid she will be disappointed if she does not find a Poste
Restante letter at Paris. I had not intended to write till I heard from
her where she would be staying at Paris—as I cannot help thinking that
Poste Restante letters at that great J. J. Rousseau office must be very
uncertain in the delivery & though I have much to say, both great &
small, it would be particularly disagreeable either that you should not
get it or that any one else should. The letter to Marseilles being
written with considerable expectation of what did in fact happen,
contained nothing which it mattered that any one should see & therefore
I have not written for it. I fear you will have enquired at Paris for
this letter before it has arrived—& as I shall so soon hear from you of
a safer place to write to I will postpone everything that it Edition:
current; Page: [192] would take long to write. You cannot think darling,
or rather you can very well think, how much I enjoyed your dear letters
on the journey & above all the pleasure it gave me to know that you had
stood the journey so well, as is proved by your having got on so fast.
That you have recovered so much strength is unspeakably delightful. If I
could be at ease respecting your life & health whatever happens, I
should have the greatest joy I am capable of. As I shall perhaps hear
from you tomorrow I will cut this short here saying only the utmost
love.

I do not know how far you take interest in passing events. The time is
very near when the new arrangements of the India Act2 will come into
operation. For my part, except the throwing open the civil service to
competition, all the changes appear to me to be for the worse. It is the
most faulty piece of work these ministers3 have turned out—whom

Dear Chadwick

I have read your paper2 carefully twice through & have annotated it in
pencil, sometimes suggesting alterations in the expression, at other
times Edition: current; Page: [193] only indicating where they seem to
be required. Your suggestions are likely to be very useful—but I think
you undervalue what can be done by a general examination. I do not find
in Trevelyan’s report3 that it is proposed to confine the examination to
Oxford & Cambridge acquirements. All depends on having the examinations
such as to afford a real test of mental capacity & good intellectual
habits—then the list of eligibles being made out on that principle, each
office might select from the list according to some test for the special
acquirements it particularly needs—or, when special acquirements & those
only are needed, as in some of the cases you mention, it might be
allowed to take these from anywhere; & not solely from the list.

Everything depends on having a really good kind of general examination.

I need not say I shall be glad to see you.

I did write to Paris poste restante my own darling—I had not intended to
do so because I thought it so very probable that at that great J. J.
Rousseau place you would never get it—but as I found by your letter from
Dijon that you were expecting one, I wrote on Wedy the 29th, directed
Mad. J. S. Mill, saying however very little because I avoided saying
anything which I should regret the miscarriage of. I have been anxiously
hoping for another letter all the week & fearing lest there should be a
worse reason for its not coming than there was. I am so happy that you
have accomplished the journey with so little fatigue or disagreeable.
The bleeding of the nose is rather a favourable circumstance than
otherwise, since it shews that even when the vessels are overfull, they
tend to discharge themselves otherwise than through the lungs. A propos
I had a visit lately from a rather elderly American, a retired judge of
the Supreme Court, Carleton by name,2 who called on me on account of the
Logic & of my father’s Analysis (the P.E. he did not seem to have heard
Edition: current; Page: [194] of) & seemed chiefly interested in the
doctrine of liberty & necessity, thinking I had conceded too much to the
free will side, & I had to explain to him that though I object to the
word necessity I am entirely with the doctrine meant by it & am so
understood by everybody except him & am attacked for it. On my asking
him the usual questions about what he does here, how long he meant to
stay &c, he told me that he had been long going about Europe for health,
that for 18 years he had been subject to hemorrhage from the lungs,
coming on at uncertain times, that the medical men say his lungs are
tuberculated, but that he has had all that time & has still very
tolerable health. You may imagine that this gave me great pleasure to
hear. The only thing that I could find he did was to take cod liver oil,
& he told me wonders about what Dr Williams,3 one of the great
authorities as you know, says of the success of the oil in the
Consumption Hospital, that a great majority recover or are greatly
improved in health: he told me the numbers, but I have forgotten them. I
have tried since to get Dr Williams’ paper on the subject, but I find it
is in a medical journal & I cannot discover in what number.4 It is a
great pity my own darling that cod liver oil does not agree with you,
but I have the strongest hopes that you will do very well without it. I
have but a poor account to give of myself: the cough it is true is
gone—I do not now cough once in a week. But the expectoration continues
& is of a worse kind—it is dislodged by a mere hem, & brought up by a
mere action of the throat without coughing. I have more fever, & am
weaker, much, than I was a month ago. I do not however think that I am
now losing strength, or if I lose one day I gain another. Yesterday (a
complete summer day as most now are) I took a longer walk than the
Eltham one,5 in the direction of Bromley—a very pretty walk it was—was
out two hours walking fast (always the best for me) & was not the least
tired, nor should I have been so I believe if I had gone twice as far. I
felt as if I could do anything, while today again I feel quite weak. But
the worst is that we have lost our mainstay, so far as my health is
concerned—reliance on the sincerity of Clark’s assurances. You may
perhaps remember that the first time I went to him I had a suspicion
that he did not tell me all he thought—but his more strenuous assurances
the second time removed my suspicion: now however it is not a suspicion
but a certainty—& the consequence is that I cannot trust anything he
says that is favourable. However, time will shew, & soon, what we have
to expect. If I could but be sure of your life & health whatever
happens, I should care little for anything Edition: current; Page: [195]
else.—My darling can judge how interested & pleased I was with all those
nice letters she wrote on the journey. When I got her approval of the
alterations in the chapter, I inserted a saving clause about piece work6
& sent the whole to Furnivall who promises a proof shortly. I have
completed an essay on the usefulness of religion7—such a one as I can
write though very far inferior to what she could. My poor mother I am
afraid is not in a good way—as to health I mean. In her usual letter
about receiving her pension she said: “I have been a sufferer for nearly
three months—I have only been out of doors twice” &c “I have suffered &
am still suffering great pain. I supposed the pain in my back was
rheumatism, but it is not—it proceeds from the stomach, from which I
suffer intense pain as well as from the back. Mr Quain8 has been
attending me during the time, & he & Sir Jas Clark have had a
consultation & I am taking what they prescribe—I can do no more.” And
again in answer to my answer—“I am just the same, but it is not
rheumatism that I am suffering from, but my liver. I thought it was odd
that my stomach should be so much affected from rheumatism. Sir J. Clark
is coming here at the end of the week to have another examination &
consultation. I cannot write much as I am so very weak.” This looks very
ill I fear—very like some organic disease. Mrs King9 she says is a
little better & is probably coming to England. I told her what you said
a propos of Mrs King’s illness. She wrote “I hope Mrs Mill is still
going on well.” There is a kind of bathos in dropping down from such
serious matters into trifles, but as trifling things must be done even
when serious ones are doing, so they may be written about. The event
proved you to be quite right about the Powell affair:10 In answer to my
note he sent the ratcatcher’s address & offered to send him, but I made
no answer & wrote to the man myself. Meanwhile he came again to Powell’s
& after finding one other rat, came on our premises unasked & Powell
also—a piece of great impudence on P’s part—but Kate very rightly would
not allow them to do anything without orders from me. The ratcatcher
came the next day in consequence of my note to him & searched all he
thought necessary but without finding a single rat—so that it is plain
there were none, but the one which he drove from Powell’s & which
afterwards returned there & was caught. I had two notes from P.
subsequent to the one I sent you but did not answer either of these. It
is of no use transcribing them here. Adieu my darling—keep up your
spirits. I will write again as soon as I hear from you & happily it does
not take long now.

Your dearest kindest letter came today my own beloved, & first touching
Clark—I should not my darling have used such a word as certainty about
his not having told me his real opinion, if I had no reason for knowing
it but a surmise of my own grounded on my notion of my symptoms. But
what there is to say on this subject as well as on my health generally
had better be said than written, if I am to have the happiness of seeing
her almost immediately. About my going, I see no reason against it in
the state of my general health but an unlucky complication has occurred
in the shape of a boil on the chest, nearly under the left shoulder,
which it seems is of a bad kind, approaching to carbuncle, & might be
dangerous if the proper treatment of it were intermitted or if I were to
go away from medical advice—therefore it seems necessary to wait the
uncertain but probably small number of days necessary for getting rid of
this, before I venture to leave—& the choice is between waiting that
time, or my darling’s crossing without me. I cannot at all judge which
is best as I do not know how capable she is of crossing. She alone can
judge—but I am most anxious that she should not come if she is really
dreading it much. If you decide, darling, to wait a few days till I am
better able to come, I will write to you all I know about my health &
all that I am doing with regard to it. But you must not think my angel
that I am in low spirits—it is true I have a much worse opinion of my
health than I had, but that is not being in low spirits nor am I at all
so. I know & think nothing now that I did not know & think three weeks
ago, but you did not think my letters to Lyons shewed low spirits. I do
not at all like the idea of Lily’s losing the semaine sainte at
Paris.—Do not think I am triste my own love or that it is the least
necessary on my account that you should come directly.—I am feeling
provoked by something in the H. of Commons last night. A creature named
Bowyer2 has obtained leave to bring in a bill to abolish actions for
damages in case of breach of the marriage contract & to make it a
criminal offence instead—in order as he says to be like all the
Continental countries—& Fitzroy3 (Palmerston4 was absent) though he
guarded himself & the Govt from being understood to concur, yet was
rather favourable in tone than the contrary. It is mixed up with things
ad captandum such as making the Edition: current; Page: [197] wife a
defendant as well as the man that she may be heard in her own behalf &
the two men not allowed as they are now to blacken her character
unopposed. But we see how touching these subjects brings bad novelties
as well as good. The Post attacks Bowyer for it,5 contemptuously enough,
of course not on the right grounds, though as good as could be expected
from ordinary conservatives—& bids him instead of this nonsense, take up
the recommendations of the Divorce Commission to make divorce easier.6—I
want my angel to tell me what should be the next essay written. I have
done all I can for the subject she last gave me. What exquisite weather.
I do hope hers is equally fine. Adieu for the present, darling.

My dear Mother

I received on Saturday another of Mary’s2 vulgar and insolent letters.
The impertinence appears the only motive for writing them and I cannot
waste my time in answering any more of them. In this she affects to
think that I wish to see her. Will you tell her, that neither I nor my
wife will keep up any acquaintance with her whatever.

I hope you are gaining strength and will soon be quite well again. When
you are able to write will you let me know how you are. I need not say
that we shall always be glad to see you.

My own blessed darling, I should not have written to you in a way which
was sure to make you anxious & uncomfortable, if it were not that
writing the whole truth would I know make you much more so. Even now I
would much Edition: current; Page: [198] rather that what I have to tell
could have been postponed till you had accomplished that crossing but
any more reticence now would probably alarm you as much as telling all.
The “all” then is that it is Clark’s own confession which made me say
that he had been insincere with me—about three weeks ago, soon after I
wrote to Avignon, he admitted to me that there is organic disease of the
lungs & that he had known this all along. My dearest angel, almost all
the pain this was to me either at the time or since, was the thought of
the pain it would give you. He added many things by way of
encouragement—that it would not necessarily shorten my life—that only a
small part of the summit of both lungs was affected—that the stethoscope
did not shew any progress of the disease since he first examined the
chest two months before—that from the age at which the attack came & the
gradual manner I had a very good chance for its becoming chronic &c &c.
to all which I attach just as much importance & no more, as my own
judgment would give to it if he had said nothing. I waited a week & then
went to him again when I found that he could do absolutely nothing for
me, except recommend cod liver oil, which I have taken ever since.
Finding this I went to Ramadge,2 & had a long conversation with him,
which ended in my determining to try his treatment. If my precious one
had been here I should not have done so unless she approved but even if
I had written to ask her, it would have been useless unless she had read
his book. He told me who some of the people were whose cases are
mentioned in the book—persons of all ranks & classes, some of them of
families whom I know—Colonel Astell,3 son of one India Director4 &
brother of another5—a grandson6 of David Ricardo—a son of Burroughes7
the member for Norfolk—the family of Law8 the recorder of London, three
of whom had died of consumption before he was consulted; four others all
had the disease & he cured them all. He shewed me numbers of letters
from people whom he had restored not merely to health but to strength &
fitness for all active pursuits though many of them far advanced in
consumption; some had been patients of Clark, Chambers,9 Watson10 &c.
Wakley11 it seems Edition: current; Page: [199] believes in him &
recommends patients to him. Altogether I find it impossible to doubt
that he has effected many very remarkable cures: & his theory seems to
me very rational. He says, all medical men have examined the lungs of
people who have died of consumption, but very few have done what he has
done all his life, examined carefully the lungs of persons who have died
of other than pulmonary diseases—& this shewed to him by a large
experience, 1st the immense number of persons who have lived the
ordinary time having tubercles in their lungs, or the marks of having
had them formerly. 2nd, that these are always persons in whom the part
of the lungs which remains sound is more than ordinarily voluminous. 3rd
that they have generally had some conformation or some morbid affection
which has impeded the free exit of air from the lungs & therefore by
partially imprisoning the air has distended the lungs & enlarged the
chest. Then it occurred to him to try if this could be imitated
artificially, & he found that by the use of the inhaling tube which he
invented the dimensions even of the chest itself were often greatly
increased & by the expansion of the lungs cavities actually formed were
closed up, & the further deposition of tuberculous matter stopped, on
the same principle in which tubercles are never found in the muscles of
voluntary motion & on which Clark accounts in his book12 for tubercles
being always deposited first & most in the upper lobes, because these
are the least expanded by the act of respiration. His paradox about
cough is not so much of a paradox when understood. Laennec13 & Louis,14
the two greatest authorities on lung disease, both strenuously maintain
(as I know not from Ramadge but from my own reading) that cough not
arising from consumption never does nor can lead to it; but they allow &
so does Ramadge that it may call it from a latent state into an
active—he merely says that the tubercles must have preexisted—that a bad
inflammatory cough often accelerates their softening & seems to cause
the disease—but that in itself the thickening of the membrane of the air
passages by catarrh is a counteractive & often a preservative against
consumption & he shews striking facts in support of this. So there being
nothing absurd in his theory, & his array of actual cures in very bad
cases being extremely striking, I thought there was ground for hope
though not for faith. He spoke with great confidence of curing me—said
that he seldom had so favourable a case or one in which there was so
small an amount of disease & now when I have been following his
instructions for a fortnight he thinks or professes to think that I am
decidedly better & shall not only be cured but soon. I need hardly say
that this is so much vain wind to me & will be so until I see it
verified. But I Edition: current; Page: [200] think he is a good
physician—a good prescriber. Though the inhaler is his sheet anchor, he
does a great many other things to check the disease & support the system
until the inhaler has time to act: he gives stomachics, tonics & slight
sedatives, & fights against the hectic fever by applying a single leech
now & then. I have done this four times & if it has done anything it has
done good, for I have not grown at all weaker in the last ten days.
Before that, I seemed to get weaker daily—but Ramadge said that this was
partly from the liver, that I was in a sort of semi-jaundiced state &
indeed my yellowness shewed it—now this he has corrected, not by mercury
which he thinks the death warrant of a consumptive patient (though Clark
gives it without scruple) as it hastens the softening of tubercles in
great numbers at once. R. has prescribed taraxacum & certainly to all
appearance he has made my digestion better than it has been for a long
time—unless it is the cod liver oil which has done it. R. thinks nothing
of that—it seems to me that a little acidity which I still sometimes
have is connected with the cod liver oil. As to the pulmonary disease,
R. asked to see the expectoration, which Clark never did—& having seen
it, says it contains tuberculous matter, as indeed is very evident to
myself. So that as there is softening going on, I must expect, as he
says, to be feverish & weak but this will not continue if the formation
of fresh tubercle is stopped, which he expects will be the effect of the
inhalation. He reckons it a very favourable sign that there is so little
constitutional disturbance when there is softening & expectoration of
tuberculous matter taking place. As for the boil I told you of, I shewed
it to him when it was only beginning & he thought it an ordinary
boil—then again three days after when it had grown large & ugly & he
said at once it was a carbuncle & very dangerous unless taken in time.
He at once opened it, told me how to poultice it, & it is now rapidly
getting well. He did not think at first but does think now that this
boil is partly a tuberculous deposit. I tell you all this, darling, at
so much length, that you may not think I am risking anything by
following Ramadge’s treatment—In all minor things I am persuaded he does
me good—while Clark did nothing & thought he could do nothing but leave
me to nature. Of the chances of his curing the disease as he so
confidently predicts I can no more judge than I could at first. There
are no signs of my being better except my not being worse—but I could
not expect any while there is softening going on—that he does not
pretend that he can arrest. Whether he is right will soon appear however
as he predicts great improvement in another fortnight. The man has a
very quiet manner & has not, to my thinking, the air either of what
vulgar people call an enthusiast, or a quack. But he has a way of
evading anything one says to which he cannot give a satisfactory
answer—& then he hardly admits that his plan can fail if properly tried,
& persevered in. I am inclined to think that he does not generally know
of the failures, as those in whose case the plan fails give over
consulting Edition: current; Page: [201] him & he loses sight of them.
But it evidently often succeeds—every time I have been to him he has
shewn me more letters received that morning, always containing more or
less evidence of success. I think it was right to try him & I hope you
will think so too.—I do not, darling, feel at all unable to come over to
her—I could do most of what R. recommends there as well as here—but if
she is fit & able to cross there seems no sufficient object in it—if she
was not I would go over directly. I sent a note at once to Haji about
the cheque book but he instead of writing himself, got a cheque book &
brought it to me—so I inclose two blank cheques—but would it not be
better that I should send French notes as before? This long letter is
all facts & no feelings—but you will know what the feelings are—the
utmost love & wish to live solely for your dear sake & for our objects.
I am not the least depressed in spirits, probably because I have hardly
any of the sensation of ill health. I wish I could be sure that you
would suffer no more than I do. Bless her!

My precious! my beloved! what a joy it is to read such a letter & how
relieved I feel by her knowing the worst of this business—though that is
a selfish feeling too when it causes her so much pain. I am most anxious
my darling to know how you are—& that you should be a great deal better
before you venture that odious crossing. You will soon, darling, I know,
feel calm again, for what is there that can happen to us in such a world
as this that is worth being disturbed about when one is prepared for
it?—except intense physical pain, but that there is no fear of in this
case. I am sometimes surprised at my own perfect tranquillity when I
consider how much reason I have to wish to live, but I am in my best
spirits, & what I wrote even in the week after Clark’s announcement
before I had seen Ramadge, is written with as much spirit & I had as
much pleasure in writing it as anything I ever wrote. It is the greatest
pleasure to me that you think as you do about Ramadge & his plans, even
on my short & imperfect explanation—though I could not doubt that what
struck one of us as being good would seem so to the other on sufficient
explanation. I think it is clear that his notions are right & that his
treatment at least works in the right direction: whether with sufficient
efficacy to stop the disease, is the only doubt. I have hitherto done
all he Edition: current; Page: [202] recommended. (I breathe through his
tube three times a day for half an hour each time—that seems very little
does it not? but he thinks it enough) with one exception—he always urges
me to get another more complex & expensive apparatus to use in the
evenings, which combines with the principle of the tube—the inhalation
of the vapour of herbs—camomile, marsh mallow & others—but I have not
done this because it evidently is not essential to his plans—nor do I
see well the good it can do—he says it is strengthening & soothing. If
you advise, however, I will try it. It has long been known that many
people live to be old with tubercles but R. says nobody before him had
the least idea how many. He thinks half the people who go about have had
tubercles. I myself have had them before without knowing it & recovered,
for the incident which produced the éclaircissement with Clark was my
coughing up a chalky concretion which I at once knew must be the saline
part of an old tubercle, which had been cured by absorption. As for
Clark’s not asking to see the expectoration—he evidently had made up his
mind as to the case from the first day—was convinced that though nature
might save me, art could not—& preferred to say nothing which might
render me more inquisitive & put him to the cost of additional
falsehoods. I continue not at all weaker—though varying from day to day.
Yesterday I took a walk nearly twice as long as last Sunday—& though I
did not feel quite as vigorous when I went out as I did the former time,
I am sure I am the better for the walk. It was a splendid & very hot day
& I returned just tired enough to make sitting down a rest. I am
stronger & better today after it than I was last Monday. Clark
recommended as much exercise in the open air as I could take without
fatigue. R. also recommends exercise in the open air, cautioning me
however against fatigue. I had no idea what pretty hilly country one
soon gets into in the direction of Bromley. I go to & from the I.H. as
usual & I think it good for me rather than the contrary. I go in the
usual 2d class which are close & give me the same command of window as
the first class & the only precaution I use is to go backward. The boil
seems extirpated & the place has only to heal. R. thinks as you do that
it was a favorable circumstance as to the pulmonary disease. I now
always breakfast at home & go out to eat something in the middle of the
day—I find this agrees better with my stomach. I send the important
pages of the April time bill2 & also the Examiner which, to its
disgrace, supports the creature Bowyer.3 The papers today announce that
the ministers have appointed a Commission to draw up regulations for the
competitive examination for the India civil service—of the four
Commissioners,4 three are acquaintances—& Edition: current; Page: [203]
as one of those is Lord Ashburton5 I suppose I shall be applied to for
an opinion.6 The others are Macaulay, John Lefevre,7 & Jowett,8 an
Oxford liberal & great auxiliary of Trevelyan. I do not know that there
is anything more to tell at present my precious, but only my fondest
love.

I have your note this morning my own darling love. Pray my darling do
not attempt the crossing till you feel better—much better. I am going on
here with everything that can be done & your presence is not at all
necessary, pleasant as it will be. I saw Ramadge again yesterday. If one
could but trust what those people say, when they wish to give
encouragement, I am doing very well; for he says the sounds of
respiration indicate a marked improvement & that he is certain of a
perfect & rapid cure. But he wishes so much to think so, & to persuade
me of it, that I do not feel that what he says can be relied on. I am
quite certain however that I am not now growing weaker, but, if
anything, a little less weak, & I think too that I have a little less of
the hectic fever, but not sufficiently so to build any decisive
inference on. You are no doubt aware that it is not uncommon for these
symptoms to abate when the first crop of tubercles have softened & been
discharged—the patient then gains flesh & strength & there is an
interval before any more tubercles soften & so there is an ebbing &
flowing of the disease, but each time an additional portion of the lungs
is made useless, so that at last one does not get better, but dies
because one has spent one’s capital—this however is often an affair of
several years—witness George2—Clark says it was astonishing that he
lived, for he had a large cavity in his lungs already before he went to
Madeira. But Ramadge is persuaded that by his treatment the deposition
of fresh tubercles may be prevented: & though successive liquefactions
of old Edition: current; Page: [204] ones at intervals from one another,
often happen to his patients, he maintains that his treatment closes up
the cavities if any which are left by their discharge—and I am quite
satisfied that he does very often effect this, though it must no doubt
(though he does not admit it) be very uncertain whether he can do so in
any individual case. In any case however I feel sure that his is as you
say the best mode to assist nature—& I cannot but think that my not
getting weaker for nearly a fortnight while a considerable quantity of
softening is going on, & not having more general derangement of health
than I have, if it is not owing to his treatment is at least a
favourable indication of the chances which nature holds out.—I am sorry
to say darling I had two notes this morning from Clara & Mary both
saying that my mother is very ill—one says that Clark & the other
medical man Quain call her disease enlargement of the liver, the other
tumour in the liver & that they think very seriously of it though not
expecting immediate danger. I need not send the notes as you will see
them so soon & now darling adieu as you will not care to hear about any
minor matters at present—bless you my own perfect & perfectly loved one.

My wife has continued in extremely delicate health ever since the
illness at Nice4 in which evidently the lungs were much concerned.
Though she does not recover any strength she has had no return of the
attack.5 I have only lately lost the cough I had at Nice but the cause
of it still continues. I am under a careful & minute system of medical
treatment which I hope in the course of the summer will produce a change
for the better. If you shd be in England this year we hope we shall see

TO THE SECRETARY OF THE NEOPHYTE WRITERS’ SOCIETY1

B[lackheath] P[ark]

April 23. 1854

Sir,—

I have received your letter of 11th of April, in which you do me the
honor to request that I will become a member of the Honorary Council of
an association termed the N[eophyte] W[riters’] Society.

So far as I am able to collect the objects of the Society from the
somewhat vague description given of them in the Prospectus, I am led to
believe that it is not established to promote any opinions in
particular; that its members are bound together only by the fact of
being writers, not by the purposes for which they write; that their
publications will admit conflicting opinions with equal readiness; &
that the mutual criticism which is invited will have for its object the
improvement of the writers merely as writers, & not the promotion, by
means of writing, of any valuable object.

Now I set no value whatever on writing for its own sake & have much less
respect for the literary craftsman than for the manual labourer except
so far as he uses his powers in promoting what I consider true & just. I
have on most of the subjects interesting to mankind, opinions to which I
attach importance & which I earnestly desire to diffuse; but I am not
desirous of aiding the diffusion of opinions contrary to my own; & with
respect to the mere faculty of expression independently of what is to be
expressed, it does not appear to me to require any encouragement. There
is already an abundance, not to say superabundance, of writers who are
able to express in an effective manner the mischievous commonplaces
which they have got to say. I would gladly give any aid in my power
towards improving their opinions; but I have no fear that any opinions
they have will not be sufficiently well expressed; nor in any way should
I be disposed to give any assistance in sharpening weapons when I know
not in what cause they will be used.

For these reasons I cannot consent that my name should be added to the
list of writers you send me.

I have the honor to be

I have as you requested written a longer letter on the plan for the

the Edition: current; Page: [206] Exchequer.2 I have been much
disgusted, less at the direct attacks on the plan, frivolous &
interested as they are, than at the cold reception of it by those who
ought to know better. It is an instance, along with the rejection of the
Scotch Education Bill3 & many others, how much the present Government is
in advance of the popular mind on most important subjects.

My dear Sir—

I am sorry that a part of what I felt bound to say (in a letter signed
with my name)2 respecting the scheme of examinations circulated with
your report, should seem to you likely to be injurious. But I hope you
will not ascribe it to amour propre when I say, that I should much
prefer withdrawing the letter to the omission of that passage.3 In
substance it is simply an assertion of what I understand to be the
avowed principle of the present Government, religious equality, a
principle now very generally professed, but usually with a mental
reservation of certain exceptions to it. I hold that there ought to be
no exceptions & when a rule is proposed which would amount to exclusion
from the public service on religious grounds, it is Edition: current;
Page: [207] a matter of conscience & duty with me not to express
approbation of the plan, without expressing in an equally decided manner
how entirely I disapprove of such an appendage to it. Even without the
proposed rule, there will be much danger lest in carrying the plan into
operation the so called religious element should be allowed to assume
such a predominance as to be practically a cause of exclusion: but when
I see a religious test actually proposed, I must be excused for saying,
that the advocacy of those whom it would exclude should either be
dispensed with altogether, or allowed to be given under a protest
against the exclusion.

My own darling love, I write a day sooner than we expected as I find
that the mail leaves here tomorrow instead of Tuesday—a bad arrangement
since it must make two sets of mail steamers necessary when one set
would suffice. I had an excellent passage, except that we did not arrive
till 11 o’clock, being 10½ hours. The tide was against us all the way &
the wind south. I felt so sick whenever I attempted to get up, that I
did not go on deck—but as this boat is made in the American fashion with
the cabin on deck (the ladies’ cabin is below as usual—contrary to the
usual practice of giving to women what is thought the best) I could see
out of the cabin windows. It was a dull threatening morning. I saw the
French coast to the left, a long low headland apparently a good way off,
& Alderney very near on the other side—looking a bare green rising
ground, not at all bold, & less in size than the part of the I. of Wight
between Ryde & St Helen’s. We went outside Jersey, coasting the west
side & then round to the south—parts of this were very rocky & fine on
the sea beach & in the sea, but the island looked poor. The water was so
low when we arrived that although there are two fine high stone piers,
we had to land in small boats. I had been told of many inns & could not
discover which was best—This was one of them & as it seemed to have a
view I came here—but it is a poor inn, not very clean, at most passable.
The vivres however are good. I have just dined at the table d’hote which
is a real table d’hote, the landlord presiding. The cookery is all
English—all things seem earlier than in England, new potatoes, peas, &
Edition: current; Page: [209] the gooseberries quite large. The town is
poorly situated, on the side of a harbour ugly as all harbours are
(except Dieppe) au fond of a larger bay than I should have thought
existed here. It is much more an English than a French town—I have heard
nobody but boys in the streets speak French—& two thirds of the names
over the shops are English—but then it is true half the shops have no
names at all. It is quite like an English country town & the roads about
are full of English second rate villas with a few first rate. The town
is large—said to have 33,000 inhabitants, the whole island having only
60,000. I see nothing tempting either in the town or the neighbourhood—I
have walked a great deal about the place & found some plants. Tomorrow I
shall try to get conveyance to the chief show places of the island. As
far as I can yet see it is generally bare of trees, though one or two
well wooded ravines intersect it from the head of the bay on which the
town stands. One cannot help comparing it with the Isle of Wight to
which it seems quite infinitely inferior. The chief feature of it seems
to be shady lanes. I have got some notion of prices from an old soldier
who has been gardener to several of the Colonels of engineers here &
from a Mr Williams at the table d’hote who seemed to be looked on as
something of an authority. Beef & mutton are 8d, best butter 10½d, the
pound (of butter) equal to 18 oz English. The butter at the inn is
tolerable & intensely yellow. Tea & coffee are brought from the
warehouses in England not having paid duty, so the price must be the
same as in England minus the duty. Bread about the same as in England. I
suppose house rent is low. Had a beautiful afternoon for my walk & it is
now a fine evening—I shall walk again after putting in this letter. I am
as well darling as I could expect to be, & in tolerably good cue for
walking—perhaps by & by I shall be so for writing—but as yet I feel as
if I should not wish to write a thing except letters to my dearest one.
I already seem to have been an age parted from her—but it will be all
for the best if it does me any good. I never have been out of spirits
since my illness but at the prospect of leaving her & now I begin
looking forward to the reunion—bless her, ever blessed one.

is supposed that it will go to St Malo tomorrow morning. In the meantime
I have lost what would have been a very rough & disagreeable passage but
it does not matter, as I have not at all exhausted this place, which
gains very much on better acquaintance. Yesterday & today began with
driving showers, but turned to beautifully fine afterwards though now in
the evening it is raining again. I was advised yesterday to go by an
omnibus which makes the tour of the island stopping a while at the
principal show places—but it turned out that the omnibuses had not yet
started for the season, & as nobody wanted to go except four people from
this inn, the omnibus owner sent a carriage instead. I felt very odd
with my three companions, a middle aged man from Manchester & two young
men. The middle aged man was very ignorant, the young men less so, one
of them knew something of chemistry, the other of geology & they all
liked walking. We went across to the north coast & saw the greater part
of it, walking a good deal; & I had a six miles walk in the evening
besides; to a tower on an old barrow planted with trees, from which the
whole island is visible. Today I was kept dangling after the steamer
till one (walking about however) but from one till ½ past 4 I went out,
a most beautiful excursion, half an hour by omnibus round the bay, the
same back, the other 2½ hours the prettiest walk in the island. The
character of the island is table land very much intersected by deep
green hollows with meadow at the bottom & wood up the sides—but no very
fine trees—a coast very much indented & abounding in promontories which
reminded me of the Riviera, wanting the mountain heights. I have made a
good many excellent captures of plants. The experiment seems to answer
thus far, for my strength is satisfactory & my health (as usual)
improved by the much walking—the strength is encouraging for the
recovery of flesh: for if the nerves are improved for one purpose they
are likely to be so for another. But I have been & still am annoyed with
pain under the right shoulder blade & between the shoulders. I have
written to Clark to ask him if I should put on a blister. I applied a
strong mustard poultice last night but from the awkwardness of the place
could not do it myself, but found a chemist who came at night, made it &
put it on—his name is Trueman & he is a true man for he gave me two
ounces more of mustard & only charged a shilling altogether. I do not
think this place can be cheaper than Devonshire except in taxed
articles, tea, wine &c. I was asked in the market 3 sh. for a pair of
fowls, a pair of ducks or a goose—none of them particularly fine. The 8d
a pound for beef, mutton & veal is the Jersey pound of 17½ English
ounces. Trueman says he pays £60 rent for his house in a street—but says
a good ten roomed house in the outskirts may be had at £30. There are no
taxes except a small one for making roads. The judges & other public
officers are all unpaid, & the military are paid by England. There are
many & various Edition: current; Page: [211] shops, some very large &
showy—& a great many booksellers chiefly for French books, with which
they seem as well furnished as any French provincial town. They are
sending quantities of new potatoes to London, in the barrels in which
they have just imported flour from America. The people seem all strong,
healthy & well off—the French they talk to one another seems a sort of
patois which I cannot understand. I have taken a sort of liking to the
place & even do not dislike this inn. I was set against it at first by
being offered a bedroom with a horribly dirty counterpane & one or two
other small things, but the room I have & the place generally are quite
clean & pleasant. This delay will throw all the plans one day later for
writing & will make me a day longer in getting her precious first
letter. I meant to have had another walk this evening but it has come on
a pouring rain. The temperature & air are soft & mild as I remember
South Devonshire. Adieu my darling—my own precious love.

My dearest dearest love, I arrived here today, having started at 10 &
had a smooth & easy enough passage of about five hours in the most
pouring wet day there has been this year—so far is the weather from
promising any improvement. As it was low water when we arrived, we could
not approach the pier, but were taken on shore in boats & had then to
walk at least half a mile over rocks & seaweed. It rained so violently
when we arrived that I made up my mind not to risk getting wet, but to
remain on board till the steamer could get in—but fortunately the rain
abated before the last boat was gone & I was able to land. I did not go
to the France where we went before but to another near it called Hotel
de la Paix, also praised by Murray, & to which almost every passenger
seemed to go. It appears good as far as I can judge. I have just
returned from the custom house where the whole bevy of passengers, women
& all, went in person, the commissioner system not, apparently, being
organized here as at the more frequented ports. I walked round the
ramparts before dinner (& was caught in the rain doing so) & even in
this wretched weather the view was fine. But I can make no plans for
tomorrow on account of the weather. The steamers to Dinan are not
running Edition: current; Page: [212] now, & the diligences as usual are
too early or too late. I employed the five hours of steamboat partly in
conning over the subject of justice for the essay2—& partly in hearing
the talk of the passengers, all quite commonplace people & yet one heard
now & then the same remarks which would be made by superior people, e.g.
that the English abroad all speak ill of one another & get up scandal
against each other—saying “Ah we know why he lives abroad, he is obliged
on account of his creditors” &c &c. The Jersey people seem to be spoken
of, even by Jersey people, in the way Yorkshire people are spoken of—one
would think they were “far north” instead of far south. From what I
heard it seems that Australia is crammed with Jersey people—people of
family as well as poor people. The emigration ships from Liverpool have
agents in Jersey, & placards all about, & there is a ship of 1400 tons
going from Jersey to Adelaide direct in a few weeks as one of the
passengers said who is going by her with the remainder of his family to
join part of it who are already there. I could not learn even the name
of a single refugee at Jersey except Victor Hugo whose letter about that
Guernsey murderer3 had drawn attention to him—the people seem to think
him a half mad oddity. There are several newspapers in Jersey both
French & English but they seem to be worth little. At the inn (all the
inns being boarding houses) they reckoned me as a boarder because I took
my meals in the public room, & they charged for board & lodging five
shillings a day, which would be cheap anywhere else especially as there
was no stinting in quantity or quality—I did not expect to find
attendance put in the bill, but so it was, & comparatively dear, being
at the rate of 15 pence a day. My back & shoulder are a little better
than yesterday (Mr Truman applied a second mustard poultice) but they
are still troublesome. I am afraid it is the slight inflammation which
so often occurs in this disease & eventuates as the Yankees say in
adhesion. However, if the weather would but improve I should get on well
enough, & should have perhaps some chance of stopping the great & rapid
wasting of flesh which has been going on for the last two months & which
if not stopped would soon make me incapable of any bodily exertion
whatever. But I do not despair of its being stopped, at least for a
time, by this journey. I long to get to St. Brieuc & to hear from her
though it will be only a day or so later than our parting. If your
health goes well I wish to live—otherwise I am indifferent to it. I find
the post does not go till 4 tomorrow afternoon, so I shall add a line
tomorrow morning. Edition: current; Page: [213] Thursday 15th. Another
wretched day of rain making it impossible to go anywhere. I have gone to
the cathedral & about the town, got weighed, tried unsuccessfully to
match my scissors &c and when I have taken this to the post shall have
to sit down & write till 4 o’clock when I have taken a coupé place to
Dinan—but if this weather lasts Dinan will be triste enough. It will not
be time lost, for when I cannot go out I can write—but it delays the
object of the journey. I seem today to be almost the only person in the
inn—the other arrivals having all gone on. If it had been fine I should
either have found some other way to Dinan earlier or made an excursion
to Cancale in the forenoon. If it is fine tomorrow I may stay a day at
Dinan, otherwise I shall go on to St. Brieuc for the letter. Adieu my
own most dearly beloved angel.

Ah darling! I arrived here this evening & she knows very well what was
the first thing I did & what the delight was of reading her precious
writing. Though I am here two days later than we reckoned on, it only
arrived here yesterday—& has the Calais postmark of the 14th which I do
not understand. Probably it did not get to London in time for Monday’s
post. It seems to have come here from Calais in one day, which is
important to know. But how could my darling think of not opening the
letter, & all letters? It is odd enough, I was thinking today in the
diligence that as nothing had been said about it, it was just possible
you might not open. As the seal was red, no doubt the news there was not
the worst news but it was of course a note caused by my announcement of
going away. However she will read it now & send the contents. She can
always best judge whether to send letters or tell me their contents. I
expect few letters of which the contents will be worth eightpence, but
still less worth a sentence of your writing. I am going on well—not
inconvenienced by any weakness except in the arms, which get fatigued by
holding an umbrella even if not up. The pain in my shoulder does not
trouble me so much. The excursion would be pleasant enough if it were
fine weather. Yesterday only cleared up a little (but not completely)
while I was en route, en banquette, to Dinan. Today it was cloudy, but
without rain, & I hoped it was clearing, but it has begun to mizzle
again since I have been here. I had a walk at Dinan of near two hours
besides going much about the town, walked much up hills & from relays on
the road Edition: current; Page: [214] here (per coupé) & have had a
country walk in the dusk since arriving. I now see what Brittany is
like, a table land, looking much wooded at a distance, all cut up by
inclosures but much of it not cultivated & so neither wild nor
civilized—dull generally but fine whenever one comes to the ravines cut
deep into it by rivers. So the plan is to halt in some of the best
ravines long enough to explore them. Morlaix appears to be one of the
best & there seem to be so many good excursions to be made from it that
though you will have probably written to Brest, yet if you get this in
time to write on Monday the letter will find me still at Morlaix which I
do not expect to leave before Thursday morning. I am still three days
from Morlaix as my plan is to go only to Guingamp tomorrow & to Lannion
next day, so not reaching Morlaix till Monday evening. Do not however
darling write to Brest after Wednesday as I do not expect to make any
stay there. As you will now know that I am getting on well, it is
possible I may not write again till I get to Morlaix so you will not be
uneasy if you do not hear again for three days. One sees how cheap
living must be here by the cheapness of the inns. At the inn at St Malo,
one of the two best, & with pretensions to be the best, the table d’hôte
was 2½ francs, breakfast with eggs 1 fr. tea the same; they got me a
real petit diner, potage, cutlets, & potatoes for 2 fr. & charged for
attendance ten sous. At Dinan, in one of the inns praised by Murray, I
had tea (my own) & with the accessories, & café au lait with eggs in the
morning, the whole charge was 3 fr. Of course I shall never think of
giving more than ten sous for service except perhaps at Brest—& I have
no doubt they will be perfectly contented. The people say living would
be still cheaper if they did not export so much to the Channel Islands &
to England. About this town they grow quantities of onions, said to be
for England. After I sent my letter to you from St Malo, the rainy day
gave me a long spell at the Essay on Justice2 & if the weather is as bad
as it threatens, we shall at least have the consolation of getting on
with that. I began it in preference to the other subject because the
thoughts had partly shaped themselves for it in my head. Among things I
forgot, one was to remind her, a week before the 1st of July, to send on
to the London Library a list of all books we have, including the lost
book “A Cruize in the Mozambique Channel”.3 I am very glad my dear one
was not troubled with Ley.4 How I wish I could wish away from her all
other troubles. As this will not go till tomorrow I shall keep it open &
if I add nothing she will know that I am well, that nothing is changed &
that I am going to Guingamp per banquette at 12 oclock. I shall go in
the banquette whenever I can as it is more open air & the coupé fevered
me a little today though I had the window open. Adieu angel mine.

Edition: current; Page: [215]
June 17. On further thoughts my beloved you had better not write to
Morlaix but to Brest, as I shall go from one to the other in a day,
probably Thursday. It is a fine morning, darling, & promises well. I
shall take this to the post before breakfast & walk after.

Bless her.

What a darling letter my own love—& how very much it makes me wish that
I may get better when I know how great a pleasure it would be to my own
sweetest one. Hitherto there is nothing particular to be said on either
side of that question. Except the day of crossing & the day at St Malo I
have had very tolerable weather—There has been only about one smart
shower each day, & it has always been so timed that it has put me to no
inconvenience. I have done everything exactly as I said in my last
letter that I meant to—& have been so much out walking whenever I have
not been travelling or eating that I really have had no time to write
any more of the Essay except for an hour at Guingamp. These Breton towns
are mostly pretty, quiet & cheerful, the houses mostly of square blocks
of granite not stuccoed & therefore looking well, & slated upright roofs
which give dignity. The valleys or rather narrow rocky ravines in which
they all stand are excessively pretty, & pleasant to explore. This town
of Morlaix however is the first fine thing I have come to—like a Swiss
town or rather like one’s original idea of one, got from drawings—the
rocks rising precipitous behind the tall houses. The town is on both
sides of a very un-Swiss because canalized & harbourized river, with
quays as broad & in some places as handsome as those at Rouen. I have
walked this evening down the ravine to where the river spreads out as it
approaches the sea—about 3 miles below the town. There are diligences
here, & generally good ones, from everywhere to everywhere, & they go
full 7 miles an hour going 20 miles journeys with the same three
horses—but there has never been anybody in them except commis voyageurs
going their rounds—the people whom the fine gentlemen that write the
Times correspondence are so fond of abusing, but I must say from talking
with them in diligences & at tables d’hôte I generally find them both
sensible & right feeling—& today I got talking republicanism with one of
Edition: current; Page: [216] them. By the bye at the table d’hôte here
today where all except me seemed to be commis voyageurs I thought I
never was at table with so many really nice looking men. I travelled
from Guingamp to Lannion with a rather pleasant & well informed
Englishman2—who or what I do not know, but he turned out to be in
Brittany on the same errand as I, & had been staying some weeks at St
Pol de Léon from which he was making a tour in Brittany. He had been he
told me for a whole year confined to two or three rooms & hardly able to
walk across one of them—expected by everybody to die of consumption
which he still has, but all his symptoms are gone & he reckons himself
quite well—though much thinner than I am he walks 20 miles with ease.
This is encouraging but it appears to be another of the wonderful
effects of cod liver oil which he has been taking for a year. I wish
darling you could take it—would you not give it a trial again with
quinine, as I took it at first? I really cannot think it was that which
gave you the illness. This man broke two blood vessels at 17 & has been
consumptive ever since—I suppose he is now about 30. He is coming to
Morlaix this evening & he & I are going tomorrow on a very promising
excursion into the interior—the day after I shall go with him to St Pol
where there is said to be the finest cathedral in Brittany—I meant to go
there & return here but as he tells me there is a diligence from St Pol
to Brest direct twice a week, Thursday being one of the days, I shall go
on by that. I suppose two days will be enough for Brest, one of them
passed in going to the French Land’s End, Cape Finisterre, so on the
25th or 26th I shall get to Quimper—do not write there later than the
22d or the 23d if put in in London: if too late for that, up to Saturday
24th (in London) will be in time for Lorient. What a really cheap
country this is. At the market of St Brieuc I saw what seemed to me most
delicate mutton, too large to be lamb but otherwise like it; & this was
8 sous the pound—veal the same—a tenth more than an English pound—less
than half the Jersey price. At Lannion this morning most beautiful lamb
was the same price, veal the same & beef the same, which at St Brieuc
was 2 sous more. Bread however free trade has made as cheap in England
as anywhere—At St Brieuc the officially fixed price of the best quality
was 11 sous the kilo or about 5d the 2 lb loaf & I do not suppose we are
paying more than that at Blackheath. At Guingamp the table d’hôte was 2
fr. & my petit diner the price of a déjeuner, 1½ fr. At Lannion, an
excellent inn, my bedroom excellent & well & much furnished, I had (my
own) tea with an omlet at night, eggs in the morning, & the whole bill
was 4 fr. The bedrooms are always 1 fr. though sometimes equal to those
charged 3 fr. for elsewhere. I have got few plants yet in France—the
botanizing at Vire & Dinan in 18443 Edition: current; Page: [217] seems
to have exhausted this part of the country. Thanks for the Spectator my
treasure. x x x x x x

I arrived here, my precious love a day later than I expected when I
wrote from Morlaix, as the excursion into the interior, it turned out,
could not be comfortably done in one day. I have received your letter
No. 3 of the 16th—I am afraid you would not get mine from St Brieuc in
time to prevent your sending No. 4 to Quimper, unless the day extra
passed at Jersey had induced you to delay writing one day beyond the
time we fixed. But I hoped to have found another letter here, written
after you received that from St Brieuc. Perhaps it will come tomorrow
morning. I propose staying two days here, one to be passed in going to
Cape Finisterre. I hope to get to Quimper from here in one day but
perhaps I may be obliged to take two & I shall probably stay there a day
for the sake of going to the other promontory, the Bec du Raz, so I
shall be at Lorient on either the 29th or 30th but as I shall not stay
there, it will hardly do for my dear one to write there after receiving
this. If she writes the same day or the next, direct Auray, Morbihan,
the place from which the Druidical antiquities are to be seen; if the
day after, to Vannes; afterwards to Nantes. This journey has been as
pleasant I think as it would have been, without you, if I had been well.
I have had no interruption from weather since St Malo & the weather
having each day improved a little, yesterday became sunny & today hot.
The excursion from Morlaix was into the central country of Brittany, to
the mines of Huelgoat & the cascade of Saint Herbot, or rather into the
fine woody ravines containing them. The country was very like the finer
& wilder parts of England, & the waterfalls somewhat like our Swallow
fall.2 I went there as I said I was going to, with an Englishman who it
seems is a barrister & is named Pope.3 He turned out a pleasant person
to meet, as though he does not seem to me to have any talent, he is
better informed than common Englishmen—knows a good deal of French
history for example, especially that of the Revolution & seems either to
have already got or to be quite ready to receive all our opinions. I
tried him on religion, where I found him quite what we think right—on
politics, on which he was somewhat more than a radical—on the Edition:
current; Page: [218] equality of women which he seemed not to have quite
dared to think of himself but seemed to adopt it at once—& to be ready
for all reasonable socialism—he boggled a little at limiting the power
of bequest which I was glad of, as it shewed that the other agreements
were not mere following a lead taken. He was therefore worth talking to
& I think he will have taken away a good many ideas from me. I shall
probably see him again at Nantes as he is to be there about the same
time with me. He had evidently travelled very little & I enjoyed his
unaffected pleasure in the scenery. I went with him to St Pol de Léon, a
pretty cheerful little place called poor & melancholy by Murray,
possessing splendid sea views & a really fine cathedral, a good deal
like Caen, besides another church with a tower which is very high &
rather fine. I came on here next day (yesterday) stopping half way for a
walk & to see a church at a place called Folgoat [sic]4 which is one of
the sights of Brittany. I have not seen much of Brest yet, but it seems
a fine town as well as a fine bay. As to health I have seldom felt
better than these last days—the fever I had for two days at Guingamp
having gone off. I have not felt quite so strong as at Jersey & the
whole of the first week & I seem to myself to be still losing flesh;
which however the weighing does not confirm, for I have been weighed
here this morning & found to weigh 65 to 66 kilos instead of 65 as at St
Malo. It was a more accurate instrument here & therefore I do not rely
on the indication as shewing any real increase of weight but at least I
cannot be losing much & it seems to shew that the journey is doing me
good. Clark, from whom I have a letter in answer to mine, warns me not
to walk so much as he thinks I am inclined to but I must be the best
judge of that. I am always out of doors, & walking when not travelling.
I have seen no English paper except one number of the Globe, but have
now & then seen a French paper which has kept me au courant of what
little news there was. From that I saw that there had been a debate on
the ballot & that Palmerston had made the speech against it5 but that
was all. I reckon on leaving our opinion on that question to form part
of the volume of essays, but I am more anxious to get on with other
things first, since what is already written6 (when detached from the
political pamphlet that was to have been) will in case of the worst
suffice, being the essentials of what we have to say, & perhaps might
serve to float the volume as the opinion on the ballot would be liked by
the powerful classes, and being from a radical would be sure to be
quoted by their writers, while they would detest most of the other
opinions. I have written nothing since Guingamp & if there are no wet
days, may not write much for the present, but if I do, it will be today
as I have no long excursion to make. You do not tell me how you are.
Perhaps I shall Edition: current; Page: [219] have another darling
letter tomorrow. The board & lodging (my usual three meals with their
tea) at the best inn (a good one) at Morlaix was just 5 francs a day. At
the inn at St Pol a person may board for 40 fr. a month—if they even
charge the bedroom per night at their usual price, one franc, it is
still less than £34 a year. This is the place for real cheap living.

I have just arrived here my dearest angel & found your letters of the
17th & 19th & also one from Colman.2 It is a comfort that my poor mother
suffered Edition: current; Page: [220] no pain—& since it was to be, I
am glad that I was not in England when it happened, since what I must
have done & gone through would have been very painful & wearing & would
have done no good to anyone. It is on every account fortunate that
another executor has been appointed. There is a matter connected with
the subject which I several times intended speaking to you about, but
each time forgot. Unless my memory deceives me, the property my mother
inherited from her mother3 was not left to her out & out, but was
settled equally on her children. If so, a seventh part of it, being
something between £400 & 500, will come to me, & I do not think we ought
to take it—what do you think?4 Considering how they have behaved,5 it is
a matter of pride more than of anything else—but I have a very strong
feeling about it. Supposing this decided there is the further question,
whether simply to refuse, by which the share will fall to be divided
equally among them, or to give it up to Mrs King6 who wants it most or
to Jane who alone of them all has behaved decently well? I have copied
on the other side Colman’s letter & my answer. I wish I could have had
your approval of the last before sending it. The applying to Haji
instead of to you was exactly like them, though probably it was rather
from ill breeding, not knowing it was an affront, than that they
intended one. As for me I am more feverish & fatigued than I was, but
perhaps both will go off. My first day at Brest, Saturday, was sunny &
hot, but Sunday there was a sea fog which made my view from Cape
Finisterre very limited, & it rained all the way back. Today there has
been much wind & several smart showers but the evening is fine. This is
a pretty country town, with a cathedral larger but hardly so fine as St
Pol. I liked Brest—especially the harbour which is a great inland sea,
communicating by a narrow passage with the sea without. I heard most
beautiful military music both in the morning & evening. Your last letter
Edition: current; Page: [221] appears by the postmark to have been four
days in coming. I have nothing to alter in the directions for writing
which I gave in my letter from Brest. I have always asked for letters up
to the last moment. No second letter to Brest had come when I left & I
now hope you did not write there a second time. If you did however they
will probably forward it. Do darling tell me how you are. If you get
worse I do not wish to get better. Adieu my own darling. Your letter of
the 19th is No. the fifth but is marked 4.

I arrived here this morning my precious angel & got your dear letter—it
grieves me that she has been so unwell. I hope she went to Brighton as
she intended & was better for it. My darling it quite reconciles me to
my own chances the moment I think she is getting worse, but I would far
rather be afraid of having to leave her than to lose her. I hope this is
only temporary & that she is better again by this time. I feared she was
unwell, but from a wrong cause, her not sending this letter to Brest, if
she had I should have received it on Saturday but I believe I asked her
not to write to Brest later than Tuesday. This letter has the London
postmark of 21st, Paris & Nantes of 22nd so you see, letters get to
Nantes the very next day, being the whole way by railroad. So Nantes
will be safe to write to until you hear from me from Nantes. I wish I
had seen a full report of Palmerston’s speech2—what was given of it in
the Spectator did not at all account for your high opinion of it,
certainly only the commonplaces I have been familiar with all my
life—while the speeches for the ballot were below even the commonplaces.
The ballot has sunk to far inferior men, the Brights3 &c. When it was in
my father’s hands or even Grote’s4 such trash was not spoken as that the
suffrage is a right &c &c. But Palmerston’s saying that a person who
will not sacrifice something for his opinion is not fit to have a vote
seems to me to involve the same fallacy. It is not for his own sake that
one wishes him to have a vote. It is we who suffer because those who
would vote with us are afraid Edition: current; Page: [222] to do so. As
for the suffrage being a trust, it has always been so said by the Whig &
Tory opponents of the ballot & used to be agreed in by its radical
supporters. I have not seen a single new argument respecting the ballot
for many years except one or two of yours. I do not feel in the way you
do the desirableness of writing an article for the Ed[inburgh] on it.
There will be plenty of people to say all that is to be said against the
ballot—all it wants from us is the authority of an ancient radical &
that it will have by what is already written & fit to be published as it
is5—but I now feel so strongly the necessity of giving the little time
we are sure of to writing things which nobody could write but ourselves,
that I do not like turning aside to anything else. I do not find the
essay on Justice goes on well. I wrote a good long piece of it at
Quimper, but it is too metaphysical, & not what is most wanted but I
must finish it now in that vein & then strike into another. Quimper &
Quimperlé are two of the prettiest towns I have seen. All the towns in
Brittany are prettily situated, being in vallies & by clear streams, &
about each of these there are evidently enough of pretty walks for a
week’s exploring. The weather however (which up to Brest was much better
than yours seems to have been) has been very bad since—today is the
first day not rainy since Monday—today is bright & fine but it is the
fineness of a confirmed wet summer which I now fear we are going to
have. But I have managed to get some good walking every day besides the
travelling which was always with an open front either the banquette of a
diligence, the cabriolet of the courier or a cabriolet voiture. I am
also now, I think, in as good walking condition as I was at first, which
for several days I certainly was not—whether accidentally or because I
had overdone, & exceeded my strength. I think the day I partially rested
at Quimper did me good. I did not go to the Bec du Raz & the Baie des
Trépassés as it was too far & bad weather, but went to the nearer
Peninsula of Penmarch instead, a fine rocky coast, & I got some plants.
Next day I went to Quimperlé but it rained nearly all the way—it cleared
however in the evening & I had a walk. This town is uninteresting: but
not as Murray pretends, dirty—on the contrary it is extremely clean: but
Murray’s information is almost always either false or behind hand.
However the inn here, recommended by him, is one of the best I have come
to. I have had a nice walk, even a pretty one, though the country is
uninteresting compared with most of the other places. Though I do not
now expect letters before Nantes I shall ask for them at Auray & Vannes.
Adieu & a thousand loves & blessings.

[P.S.] I suppose H’s letter6 had nothing worth telling now when the end
is come.

I arrived here darling this afternoon from Vannes & found her two
letters. To begin with what I feel most about—surely dearest love it is
full time to have some advice about the swelling in the side? either to
see Tuson2 in the way you thought of doing or to send for South3—it
would be so advantageous in case of any sudden illness to have some
competent person near who knew something of the previous state of your
health—& I cannot think my darling angel that it can be safe to let this
pain in the side grow worse—I have no doubt it is something not
necessarily connected with the general state of the health & capable of
being treated & cured separately—though tending while it continues, to
make all other illness worse. Then about the things required by bad
health which you say you are small luxuries—let us have them, that is,
you have them darling, at least up to our income. We are now living much
within it—& we are not likely to lose more than £300 a year for the
Directors are not likely in the circumstances to give less pension than
the highest they can give by law, which in my case would be, I am almost
sure, three fourths of the salary. I suppose we can decide tolerably
well now what mode of life to lay our plans for. I suppose we may
resolve to go abroad for the winter—for my own part I now feel pretty
confident of being alive then, & not so much worse as to make it
impossible or useless for me to go—& though if we are alive we may
probably come to England next spring, I suppose we shall never again
live in England permanently, so we can judge well enough what we can
afford, & have everything desirable which is consistent with it. About
that matter of my mother’s inheritance,4 of course as your feeling is so
directly contrary, mine is wrong, & I give it up entirely—but it was not
the vanity of “acting on the supposition of being a man of fortune”—it
was something totally different—it was wishing that they should not be
able to say that I had taken away anything from their resources. However
that is ended, & I need say no more about it.—You do not mention my
letter from Brest, but I suppose you received it. I cannot imagine why
that from Morlaix took so long. You must have by this time received the
one from Lorient. Since that time there have been four beautiful days, &
I hoped the Edition: current; Page: [224] fine weather had come, but
alas, it rained much last night & a few showers this morning: it has
however been fine since. I staid one night at Auray & two at Vannes, &
saw the Druidical antiquities partly from one & partly from the other—a
Frenchman at the table d’hote at Auray advised me to go from Vannes to
the places which are best gone to in a boat, for the sake of going
through the inland sea called Morbihan & its multitude of isles—& I am
very glad I did so, for the panorama of them as seen from two islands on
which I landed was quite unlike anything else in Brittany, & as is
always the case with these things, what one sees by the way is much
better worth seeing than the things themselves. I spent all yesterday on
the water except a three hours walk about Locmariaker between going &
returning—it was lucky I had the fine weather when it was so much
wanted, for distant views & water scenery. It was most beautiful &
enjoyable. I meant to write to her from Vannes, but did not get back
till after post time & thought it better to write from here. I had some
very nice walking too at Auray & much of it. That part however of
Brittany is in general much tamer than those I had seen before. The
northern part is as I described, table land intersected by deep ravines
containing clear streams. The corner by Quimper & Quimperlé is much
prettier, being all hills & deep valleys, with little or no table land.
The rest, from Lorient to Nantes, comparatively flat & tame, though very
pretty in parts as at Auray where the river, fine when the tide is up,
flows among wooded though not high hills. The south coast also is not
nearly so cheap for travelling as the north—whether for living I do not
know, for they say prices have been raised in all the further end of
Brittany by provisioning the Brest fleet—but at Quimper as well as Brest
the table d’hôte was 3 francs & nowhere since has it been less than 2½ &
they ask, for all but their worst bedrooms, 1½ francs. However at
Lorient veal & mutton were only 9 sous & beef 10. Butter (good all
through Brittany) they asked in the market 13 sous for a pound of.
There, as at Brest, I am told the best meat is 15 sous, but I have not
asked at the market yet. Murray is as ridiculously wrong as usual about
the fineness of this town. The quais which are the only thing pretending
to be fine are infinitely below Rouen—the best part about equal to the
worst of Lyons & no fine buildings, for the cathedral, though of a
stately height & with fine columns, wants length & is altogether poor
externally. It is quite funny to see how the travelling English who
inform Murray, copy the ways of thinking & judging of Frenchmen. I
expected to find Brittany very bare & wild instead of which it is the
best wooded part of all France, remarkably like England in general
appearance, intensely green, with decidedly less of heathy ground than
any part of the south of England, & what there is, not looking wild
because cut up into inclosed patches. Murray is quite poetical about the
stones at Carnac which he says are on a blasted heath, as dreary as
Macbeth’s—now the heath is a cheerful piece of greenery close to a large
village & there are oats growing between Edition: current; Page: [225]
some of the rows of stones. Brittany however must be much altered—the
most splendid roads cut it in all directions & the marks of recent
cutting down of hills & terracing the slopes of roads by changing their
direction are perpetual. As for my health, I am still feverish, for the
last 24 hours more so than usual—but my strength has come back & I can
walk as well or better than before I set out. I do not expect to find
that I have lost any flesh since Brest. I shall get myself weighed
tomorrow. I think the excursion has done me good, though there has not
been time for it to do much. I do not know whether to prolong it or not.
I found a letter here from Clark advising me to stay a few weeks
longer—I shall not do that, but I feel rather inclined, as I am so near,
to employ a week in seeing something of La Vendée—this however I shall
not do unless I hear that you are better & that you advise it. Letters
will come here very quickly, & en attendant I shall go to Pornic, the
sea bathing place we have often wished to see—the letter (however short)
which I hope to find at the post office here when I come back, will
decide me whether to take the additional week or return at once, by
Angers & Saumur, then crossing the country to the Rouen railroad &
taking the steamboat from Dieppe. Adieu my own precious darling angel.

You will be surprised, darling, at my writing again directly, but I
cannot tell you too soon what you will be glad to hear. I was weighed
this morning & found to weigh 67 kilos. The difference between this & 65
at St Malo, 65 to 66 by the more accurate instrument at Brest, is more
than can be accounted for by any inaccuracies & is the surest proof that
the excursion has done me good. Even if I have gained much less than
four pounds in three weeks, it is very encouraging & makes me think I
may have still two or three years of life in me. If so, much may be done
in the time. I have been going about this town all the morning,
pleasantly enough, as every French town contains much interesting & is
at any rate agreeable. I spent a very pleasant hour in the picture
gallery in which there are some good pictures, & old copies of many
more. The town itself improves on further knowledge; I had not seen the
best of the quais, which is below the main body of the town, & opposite
the shipping, but it is not equal to Rouen or near it. Beef & veal here
are 12 sous the pound, mutton 14—the first place where I have found
mutton the dearest. Tomorrow at ½ past 7 I shall start by the steamboat
Edition: current; Page: [226] for Paimboeuf & from there to Pornic. I
have heard nothing of my St Pol acquaintance.2 I want to order mourning,
a coat & trousers, from Carbery, & would write to him but I do not know
where to tell him to send the things: Will she darling either tell me
what she thinks, or order them—perhaps Lily would write a note in my
name. Thanks darling for the Spectator which this time is better than
usual & now adieu with a thousand loves & blessings.

I have just returned from Pornic my own precious one & have found here
her two letters. All the letters she mentions have come safe & in their
right order though several had been lying some time in the post offices
before I received them. I am glad she is going to see Tuson—I am very
anxious & do not much like prolonging my absence when I do not hear that
you are better—however on the whole I think it is best that I should
make the excursion I projected into La Vendée as I am so evidently
benefiting by the journey. The two days which I spent at Pornic I have
been quite remarkably well & stronger for walking than I have been at
all since I began to lose strength; as well as very little feverish.
Today I am rather more feverish again but that is a symptom which has
always varied very much up & down. Pornic is such a pretty, funny little
place—about the size of Rottingdean, & in much the same situation,
except in being at the head of a little cove—the height of the place
above the sea much the same but the actual cliff (or rocky escarpment
rather, for one can in most places get down it) only about half that
height—but the place & its paths & drives over the sea are very pretty &
at present very quiet & the whole place is fragrant with Spanish broom
which they plant everywhere. I looked at three or four of the houses or
lodgings to let—they are all very clean & with a little additional
furniture we could inhabit some of them—the general demand seems to be
500 francs for the season, or 200 the month—very dear therefore—but the
best I saw would take less & the next best asked less (130 fr. the
month). There are some good (or at least better) looking ones out of the
town in good situations. The sea view is very fine with the long narrow
island of Noirmoutier six leagues off, closing up a considerable
Edition: current; Page: [227] part of it. There is another watering
place, le Croisic, apparently more pretentious, but this is further off,
on the coast of Brittany, towards Vannes, & I have not seen it. I went
down the Loire in the steamboat to the very mouth of the mouth, at Saint
Nazaire but the country on both sides is flat & uninteresting. I do not
know how far I shall go into La Vendée as it will depend on how I like
it, but in any case it will be convenient to return through Nantes, so
darling write there up to the 12th inclusive. I hope she has not written
to Rouen as that will be so long to wait. The weather has generally been
very pleasant—sunny & warm, with a few very short showers every day—it
seems to be much worse with you—three wet summers in succession—a thing
that has not happened since 1828/29/30 & of those only 1829 was as bad
as these have been. I have not only gained some good but probably
escaped some harm by being away at a time when I could probably have
walked little. On returning from Pornic I found here my consumptive
acquaintance Mr Pope & he is going into La Vendée with me. I do not know
whether much can be made of him but he seems to me the sort of person
for whom chiefly we write & I should like to send him the Pol. Economy.
At present I do not believe he ever heard of it or has the least idea
who I am, except that he now knows my name. About the ballot, it is
quite true that few speak or write against it but persons of Whig or
Tory tendencies—but one of Sydney Smith’s most popular things,2 sold at
railway stations &c is an attack on it & there are & will be plenty of
speakers against it & plenty of articles in all the newspapers—the daily
ones I mean—except the D. News & perhaps the Advertiser. On
reconsideration darling, direct aux Sables d’Olonne, Vendée, up to the
11th & Nantes to the 13th inclusive. Adieu with all possible love.

[P.S.] De Morgan3 can I think wait.

My last letter, my precious one, was I believe wrong numbered; it was
dated Nantes July 9. It was really No. 12 & this is No. 13. I have got
thus Edition: current; Page: [228] far very pleasantly, & am evidently
benefiting more & more—my increase of feverishness has quite gone off;
these last days I have had very little fever & though I cannot perceive
by the eye any increase of flesh, I shall probably find some increase of
weight when I am next weighed. Another sign of improvement is that there
is certainly some enlargement of the chest. I had not measured for some
time, & I now find a very visible difference. I am stronger & more
capable for walking purposes than I have yet been. So you see darling
the journey has answered its purpose as far as I am concerned. I am
anxious for news of her but I probably shall arrive at Les Sables soon
after her letter. This country is on the whole inferior to Brittany but
has some very pretty places & the weather has been extremely
accommodating, being fine at all walking times & raining chiefly at
night, or if by day, during the times when it is of no consequence.
Having a not disagreeable companion in this excursion makes a variety,
an additional change from travelling alone; though the change to
travelling alone will be quite as pleasing a variety when it comes, for
the man2 has very little in him though perfectly well disposed to
receive. We went on Sunday to Clisson, an exceedingly pretty rural
valley with a fine old castle & two shew pleasure grounds which would be
very pretty indeed if they were kept as they would be in England; Monday
to Mortagne, Tuesday to Les Herbiers & today here, having at each place
two long walks & a good stroll besides. There are hardly any towns &
very few large villages—the country is bosky & green, the best of it
like Brittany, & therefore like England, the greater part like
Warwickshire, & the tamer inland counties—a large fine ruined castle of
which one never heard, at every village with almost no exception—the
towns & villages all new, having been all destroyed in the Vendean war3
either by the royalists or the republicans—but nothing whatever to make
one like the idea of living here. All that Murray says of the country
either was never true or has ceased to be so; it is more uniformly
highly cultivated than any part of England which I know of, & the lanes
he talks about are simply English lanes, very like those in Sussex—but
the whole country both in matter & spirit must be extremely changed by
the fine roads which now pierce it as the French happily say in all
directions. The crops are splendid & the people from all accounts better
off than in most parts of France—a labourer earning about £24 a year &
his food. The eatables are not so good as in Brittany—there I never once
met with any but very good butter even in the smallest places—here it is
seldom good & I have never yet found it very good. This town, the only
one of any size in La Vendée, except Les Sables, was built by Napoleon4
as a means of coercing the Vendeans & is a very inactive dead looking
though not uncheerful Edition: current; Page: [229] place—unluckily not
in a beautiful situation. We have now got into the Plain of La Vendée,
having left the hilly part of Les Herbiers—the last point, the Mont des
Alouettes, where the Duchess of Berry5 built a chapel, commands a view
almost from Nantes to the very opposite extremity of La Vendée & the
weather was most splendid for it. We liked it so much that we walked up
to it again in the evening. We go tomorrow to La Rochelle which will be
the extreme point of my peregrinations & shall then make a round to Les
Sables & from there to Nantes. My darling will be safe in writing to
Nantes up to the 15th. I shall write again from Les Sables if not
sooner. Adieu my own precious with a thousand thousand loves.

My own dearest love, I had not the slightest expectation of writing to
you from this place or of coming here at all—my plan was to go north
from La Rochelle by the roundabout way of Niort & Fontenay—but it
appeared that the only ways to get from La Rochelle to Niort today
(except by voiture which was too dear even for two) was at 7 in the
morning inside a diligence or at 5 in the evening—the first was
undesirable on all accounts & as the people at the Messageries said
there was a diligence from Rochefort to Niort at the same hour in the
afternoon, it seemed as well, having staid all yesterday at La Rochelle,
to take this place on the way to Niort—but on coming here it appeared
there is no diligence till 5 tomorrow morning. This is the first
contretemps that has happened to me in the whole journey—but I shall not
lose a day by it though I may be obliged to shorten my walk either at
Niort or Fontenay. I shall in any case be at Les Sables on Monday
evening. I did not care at all for seeing Rochefort but without Niort &
Fontenay one has not seen La Vendée & I had laid my plans so as have a
splendid walk at each. You may know by my taking it so leisurely that
the journey continues to do me good, indeed it seems to do me more &
more. I was weighed at La Rochelle & had gained two pounds more, making
six pounds since St Malo—it shews how much weight I must have lost
before, as these six pounds make not the smallest perceptible difference
to the eye. Edition: current; Page: [230] I have gained still more in
strength: yesterday at Rochelle I was out from eight in the morning till
nine at night literally with only the exceptions of breakfast & dinner—&
walking all the time except an occasional sitting on a bank. La Rochelle
is a very nice town, very clean & quiet, with arcades along almost all
the streets like Suza and Bologna—the baths are by the seaside a little
way out of the town, in a very prettily planted garden & shrubbery along
the seaside something like the Villa Reale at Naples, but short in
comparison. The military band plays there twice a week in the evening &
we happened to hit upon it by accident at the very time. The garden was
full of French people—I saw no others—very gay & smart, though not
looking like our idea of ladies or gentlemen. The whole place is very
pretty; there is a reading room & concert room at the baths, everything
in short except baths themselves. I went in to see the kind of
thing—they were little oblong tin cuvettes, smaller & less good looking
than those at Pornic, which were very like our bath at home but smaller.
There are people passing & repassing to the baths all day, sometimes in
private carriages, & it is evident that the place is very much used as a
watering place by well off French people—who seem by the bye when they
go there to take all their children with them. It is odd they nowhere in
France contrive to have baths fit to use. Dirty however the baths did
not seem, & still less at Pornic, where the people evidently pique
themselves on their propreté. La Rochelle is hardly pretty enough to
wish to live there, though the sea views are very fine: but it might be
pleasant to visit. Meat, the first quality of all kinds, was at the
market 12 sous: butter, tolerable but not equal to Brittany, 15. This
place, Rochefort, is a quite modern town, built by Louis XIV & very neat
& pretty of the kind but no pretty country near. It is now & has for
some days been splendid weather—not too hot because tempered by a fine
sea wind. All the corn seems fit to cut & some is already cut. I am
impatient to get to Les Sables for her letter, & nothing but the great
good it is doing me would have induced me thus to prolong the
excursion—this contretemps about the coaches therefore bores me. Bless
you my precious precious life.

My dearest angel, as I found no letters at Les Sables I came on at once
here & found your letter dated the 12th which tells me of another to
Rouen Edition: current; Page: [231] & seems to tell of another here, for
it says “I told you in my last that I had written to Rouen”—the last I
received before this, was dated the 6th & said not that you had but that
you would write next to Rouen. I hope darling that your memory,
generally so accurate, has confounded these two things—for otherwise a
letter has been lost—the very civil man at the post office here made a
great search for it but without effect. I suppose the letter at Rouen
will tell me what I most wanted to hear viz. what Tuson said. I found
here a note from Colman inclosing the note of my mother, which he
mentioned before. It is dated 27th March & runs thus—“I did not mention
the furniture in my will which you were so kind as to leave for my use,
but as some of it is a great deal worn, I hope you will take the best of
it, & do as I should have done if I had considered it my own, give the
rest to your two unmarried sisters, Clara & Harriet. Your plate is taken
care of & will be restored to you by your sisters. God bless you my dear
son—I sincerely hope that you & Mrs Mill will enjoy many many years of
uninterrupted happiness.” I remember, before, she could not or would not
understand that the furniture was given to her out & out, though it was
repeatedly impressed on her. Colman says, “I inclose your mother’s
letter which was opened agreeably to your permission. With regard to the
furniture C[lara] & H[arriet] wish me to say that as they mean to give
up housekeeping, they have no wish to receive from you that share of the
furniture to which your mother refers in her letter, & as they intend
leaving the house as soon as possible they would be obliged by your
letting them know what you wish done with it & where you wish your plate
to be sent. I have written to Mr Wotton2 my cotrustee to arrange if
possible to transfer the funds left by Mrs Burrow’s3 will on Monday
next, & should you be able to send it I should be glad of a line by that
time to say whether you wish a transfer made or the amount sold only, &
if the latter into whose hands you wish it paid. If I don’t hear from
you we shall adopt the usual course.” The last matter therefore has by
this time settled itself—as to the first, it is most unnecessary &
absurd that we should have to write or do anything about it at all. Of
course we can only say that the furniture was my mother’s & must be
dealt with as such—but I cannot write the note without a consultation so
unless you think it can wait for my return (as I shall be at home now in
little more than a week), perhaps darling you will write to Rouen what
you think should be said & in what manner, both about that & the plate.
A letter will be in time if it leaves London on the 22nd—It is most
unlucky that there should have been such atrocious weather in England.
In this journey I have hardly lost an hour by weather though there has
been a good deal of rain—but four days ago the weather set in intensely
hot & bright, & one day even reminded Edition: current; Page: [232] me
of those days at Tours. I have therefore not been able to walk quite so
much as before, especially such long walks, though I have walked a good
deal & am not at all weakened by it. My strength is most satisfactory
but this is not weather to gain flesh in. A good deal of the
feverishness has come back but I could not expect less in such hot
weather. Thanks darling for what she says about Mr Pope, but I do not
think he is at all of a calibre to be a permanent acquaintance. I
thought more of him at first than I do now from finding his opinions or
sentiments so good on the great subjects & such an apparent willingness
to receive, & from finding that he was a little up in French history,
had read some poets &c I fancied him well informed, but I am now chiefly
pleased with the proof he seems to afford that right opinions are very
widely scattered through England, when they have reached so very little
educated & so little clever or rather so dull a man as he seems to me to
be. I will give him a general invitation to call at the I.H. & I can
hardly do less after passing so many days in travelling with him—& if he
comes we can aviser about anything further. Since I wrote from Rochefort
I have seen Niort, an ugly & Fontenay a pretty place—also a fine
cathedral at Luçon—Les Sables is on a splendid bay, reminding one of
Sandown, but with a still finer beach & a magnificent swell of the sea
in waves parallel to the shore, breaking into surf half a mile’s length
at a time. There is nothing else good there; the town is the meanest
French town I ever saw, hardly a house with more than one story to it, &
the streets or rather lanes the worst paved I shd think in France. The
town forms a narrow ridge between the bay & a large harbour, much too
large for the place as the entrance is getting itself filled up by sand
& ships cannot enter. There are plenty of bathing machines, but the hot
baths! oh! The principal establishment has just four, in little closets
on the beach. Adieu my own most precious. I go tomorrow by railway to
Angers.

I have just arrived here my own darling & have received the three
letters you addressed here containing the entire history of that
horrible abscess. As it has turned out I am perhaps fortunate in having
received them all together, as I should have been very anxious, which
now I hope there is no cause to be, but on the contrary a permanent evil
got rid of (I did not perceive the bull). It confirms your old
impressions, for you have often thought there had been inflammation & an
abscess is I believe proof positive of chronic inflammation which also
it carries off. How very fortunate you saw Tuson when you did. I have
not written since Nantes & have come here in less time than I intended,
owing to the tropical heat, as the Paris papers very truly call it,
which makes it almost impossible & not altogether desirable to walk
much. I meant to have had country walks; & long ones, at all the places.
At most I have only been able to walk about the towns. The first day I
halted at Areines for a few hours & had a 3½ hours walk in the hot sun
(with my umbrella up however) & did not feel tired, or the worse for
it—but I could not have done so any other day. At Saumur I walked in the
evening to the druidical remains which are much finer than any I saw in
Brittany, but none (except Gavr Innis on the island) are really fine
like Stonehenge because, like all things in France, they are the reverse
of solitary. I had generally to set out too early in the mornings to
have an early walk, & in the evenings even after dark it is most sultry.
This morning however at Vernon where I went on purpose, I was out at
half past five till about half past seven & afterwards passed some of
the hot hours in the shady woods of Louis Philippe’s2 chateau—an
evidently nice house, with grounds & woods which we could make pretty.
Notwithstanding the scorching heat & intense sun, I like the Seine as
much as ever but the Loire is a thorough humbug—though a fine river, for
the Seine after it looks like a ditch—but it turns out that the part
from Blois to Tours which I always supposed the dull introduction to
something very beautiful beyond, is the only pretty part there is, or at
least much Edition: current; Page: [234] the best. From Angers almost to
Saumur is an absolute plain. There seems some prettyish country behind
Saumur towards the south, but not visible from the river. The finest
things I have seen are the cathedrals. Angers is more curious than fine,
Evreux fine, Le Mans magnificent, but Chartres deserves all & more than
all that has ever been said of it—I only know Amiens & St Ouen that can
be compared with it, & till I have seen them again I do not know if even
they are equal to it. I shall see St Ouen this evening or tomorrow & the
other nice old places & shall have plenty of time to do the little
commissions she gave me the pleasure of. I shall get weighed again
tomorrow but shall not be surprised if I find I have lost flesh in this
very hot weather. I have not lost strength, which is very satisfactory.
However seeing the heat which as is natural grows every day greater, I
see no use in continuing the journey & shall therefore return home at
once. I almost fear you may not get this before my return. I shall go to
Dieppe tomorrow afternoon (Tuesday) & the steamer I find leaves at two
on Wednesday morning & also at 8.45 on Wednesday evening. At present I
think I shall go by the former, in which case I shall have the happiness
of being with her some time on Wednesday—if not, early on Thursday. I
have been absent six weeks last Saturday, exceeding the longest term we
thought of, but it has done enough good to be well worth it. I shall
write the letter to Colman3 exactly according to your pencil which seems
to me perfectly right—about the plate, there is nothing at all curious
or which was presented to my father, & to us it would only be worth its
value as old silver—I will therefore as you suggest tell him to deal
with it as with the furniture. About Mr Pope, he & I exchanged cards
when we separated the first time, & my card had no address on it—I meant
to have written India House but forgot. When I left him at Nantes I said
I should be glad to see him when he comes to England & that he would
find me or hear of me at the I.H. but he asked me to write to tell him
how I am when I get to England & I said I would—I meant to write last
thing from Dieppe in order that the writing might be like a continuance
of only travelling acquaintanceship, but I shall now, I think, not write
till I see my precious love & have discussed that & many other things.
On the Loire the inns continue cheap though not so cheap as in Britany
but the moment one is in Normandy dearness begins. At Saumur the best
meat was said to be 11 sous. I got a dish of fine currants for a sou.
The best inn at Nantes, an excellent one, is very moderate for a large
town. Thanks darling for the Spec. With all possible love.

[P.S.] If she only wrote three to Nantes I got them all—but instead of
June 26, July 6 & 12 I got June 29, July 4 & 12.

Sir—

Having just returned from the Continent I find your note. I very much
wish that it were in my power to refer you or anyone to a book or set of
books fitted to form a course of instruction in moral philosophy. None
such to my knowledge, exist. In my opinion ethics as a branch of
philosophy is still to be created. There are writers on the subject from
whom valuable thoughts may be gathered, & others (particularly Bentham)2
who have thrown some though not sufficient light on the mode of
systematizing it. But on the whole every one’s ideas of morals must
result from the action of his own intellect, upon the materials supplied
by life, & by the writers in all languages who have understood life
best. The part of psychology which corresponds to morals is one of the
most imperfect parts of that most Edition: current; Page: [236]
imperfect science. Its most important portion, the laws of the formation
of character, have never yet been treated otherwise than superficially.
Some idea of the little which has been done may be gathered from parts
of Hartley on Man3 & from my father’s article “Education”4 in the Suppl
to the Enc. Britannica; but I do not recommend even these for any other
purpose than that of furnishing suggestions & stimulus to your own
thoughts.

TO BARBOT DE CHÉMENT1

East India House

7th August 1854

Monsieur,—

Votre lettre est arrivée à mon adresse pendant que j’étais en voyage et
ce n’est qu’aujourdhui que je suis à même d’y répondre.

Vous me demandez les noms des personnes connues, scientifiques ou
politiques de ce pays-ci, qui adhèrent à la doctrine de M. Comte, et
vous me faites l’honneur de me demander, en outre, mon propre jugement
sur cette doctrine.

Il y a en effet en Angleterre un certain nombre d’individus qui ont
connaissance des écrits de M. Comte2 et qui en font, à plusieurs égards,
un grand cas. Mais je ne connais ici personne qui accepte l’ensemble de
ses doctrines ni que l’on puisse regarder comme son disciple;3 à
commencer par moi, qui Edition: current; Page: [237] ai suivi sa
carrière dès ses premières publications, et qui ai plus fait peut-être
que tous les autres pour répandre son nom et sa réputation.4

J’admets en général la partie logique de ses doctrines, ou en d’autres
mots, tout ce qui se rapporte à la méthode et à la philosophie des
sciences.

Tout en y trouvant quelques lacunes que je m’efforce de remplir à ma
manière je reconnais que personne, hors Aristote et Bacon, n’autant fait
pour perfectionner la théorie des procédés scientifiques.

J’admets en grande partie la critique de ses devanciers, et les bases
générales de la théorie historique du développement humain, sauf les
divergences de détail. Quant à la religion, qui, comme vous le savez
sans doute, pour lui comme pour tout libre penseur est un grand obstacle
auprès du commun de mes compatriotes, c’est là sans contredit que mes
opinions sont le plus près de celles de M. Comte. Je suis parfaitement
d’accord avec lui sur la partie negative de la question, et dans la
partie affirmative, je soutiens comme lui que l’idée de l’ensemble de
l’humanité, representée surtout par les esprits et les caractères
d’élite, passés, présents, et à venir, peut devenir, non seulement pour
des personnes exceptionelles mais pour tout le monde, l’objet d’un
sentiment capable de remplacer avec avantage toutes les religions
actuelles, soit pour les besoins de cœur, soit pour ceux de la vie
sociale. Cette vérité, d’autres l’ont sentie avant M. Comte, mais
personne que je sache ne l’a si nettement pesée ni si puissamment
soutenue.

Restent sa morale et sa politique, et là-dessus je dois avouer mon
dissentiment presque total. En me donnant comme positiviste autant que
personne au monde, je n’accepte en aucune façon la politique positive
comme M. Comte se la représente, ni quant aux anciennes doctrines qu’il
conserve; ni quant à ce qu’il y ajouta du sien. Je ne conçois comme lui
ni les conditions de l’ordre, ni par conséquent celles du progrès. Et ce
que je dis pour moi, je pourrais le dire pour tous ses lecteurs anglais
à moi connus. Je ne pense pas que les doctrines pratiques de M. Comte
aient fait ici le moindre chemin. Il n’est connu, estimé, ni même
combattu que comme philosophe. Dans les questions sociales il ne compte
même pas. Lui-même il n’ignore pas ce fait, et se plaint que ses
admirateurs anglais n’acceptent que sa philosophie et rejettent sa
politique.

Il me parait, donc, peu probable, Monsieur, que vos sentiments envers la
doctrine de M. Comte puissent rencontrer ici le genre de sympathie dont
vous témoignez le désir. Toutefois M. Comte commence à être assez
généralement Edition: current; Page: [238] connu comme chef d’école, et
dans le nombre de ses lecteurs il peut y en avoir quelques uns qui
acceptent ses doctrines plus intégralement qu’aucun de ceux qu’il m’est
arrivé de connaître.

Sir—

I have the honour of receiving your letter dated the 20th of July. As
the specimen of your translation of my Logic,2 which you mentioned your
intention of sending, did not accompany the letter, I have waited some
days for it; but as it has not yet arrived, I will no longer delay
expressing to you the pleasure it gives me to learn that a translation
of my book has been undertaken by one who has entered so thoroughly into
its spirit, as your letter shews you to have done. I am not acquainted
with the translation which has been made of the Inductive portion of the
book.3 I am glad to hear from you that it has been so successful; but
you have very rightly judged that, to give to the cultivators of
physical science the theory of their own operations, was but a small
part of the object of the book and that any success in that attempt
Edition: current; Page: [239] was chiefly valued by me as a necessary
means towards placing metaphysical & moral science on a basis of
analysed experience, in opposition to the theory of innate principles,
so unfortunately patronized by the philosophers of your country, & which
through their influence has become the prevailing philosophy throughout
Europe. I consider that school of philosophy as the greatest speculative
hindrance to the regeneration so urgently required, of man and society;
which can never be effected under the influence of a philosophy which
makes opinions their own proof, and feelings their own justification. It
is, besides, painful to see such a mass of cultivated intellect, and so
great an educational apparatus, as exist in your country, wasted in
manufacturing a false appearance of science out of purely subjective
impressions. To be thought capable of maintaining a contest against that
school even in Germany, is one of the highest compliments my book could
receive. Of the opportuneness of a translation, & its chances of
success, you must be a much better judge than I can be. Your letter is a
proof of your competency for translating the book & I shall be happy to
give whatever assistance my opinion can afford you on any of the minor
matters on which you express a desire to communicate with me.

principal de l’ouvrage tout entier, qui a été surtout destiné à répandre
sur la méthode des sciences morales, les lumières qu’on peut trouver
dans les procédés des sciences physiques. Je ne m’exagère pas la portée
de ce que j’ai fait, ni même de ce Edition: current; Page: [240] qui
peut se faire dans ce genre. Mais j’estime comme un grand honneur à mon
livre, d’avoir éveillé des sympathies et donné une impulsion

quelque chose pour donner aux cultivateurs de ces études, les plus
importantes et les moins avancées de toutes, une meilleure discipline

Sir—

Your letter of Jany 9th has reached me within these few days. I am glad
to hear of the various literary enterprises you have in hand or in
contemplation, as I feel assured from the character of your work on Pol.
Ec. that your speculations on any subject to which you have applied
yourself will contain (whether I agree with them or not) enough both of
knowledge & of originality & ingenuity to more than justify bringing
them before the world. I have made more use of your treatise2 than you
appear to have been informed of, having quoted largely from it,
especially from your discussion of the circumstances which influence the
“effective desire of accumulation”, a point which you appear to me to
have treated better than it had ever been treated before. I have already
published my opinion that nothing was wanting Edition: current; Page:
[241] to your book except favorable chances to have gained you the
reputation you desire, & which I hope you may acquire by other writings.

You could not however have addressed yourself to any person less capable
than myself of giving any useful assistance in bringing out your
speculations on the Hawaiian language. My own pursuits do not lie in the
direction of comparative philology nor have I any acquaintances in this
class of érudits (chiefly to be found in Germany) from some one of whom
you desire a recommendation & his name as editor. Nor do I think this
would easily be obtained for the preliminary pamphlet which you
contemplate, whatever might be the case with the completed work.3 Even
to get the pamphlet printed is more than I am able to undertake, not
only from pressing occupations, but because the state of my health
renders my residence in England, at the time when your MS could reach
me, extremely unlikely.

Dr. Arnott4 whom you mention as an old acquaintance is alive &
flourishing & may possibly have it more in his power to promote your
object than myself.

You ask me how your book became known to me. I first heard of it from
Mr. Senior5 who recommended it to me as a book of which he had a high
opinion, & after I had read it through his means I picked up a copy on a
stall.

I hope your health is quite reestablished.

I am Sir very faithfully yours

Sir

I beg to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your pamphlet “On Some
Fallacies of Political Economy”.2

I quite agree with you that many fallacies are engendered by the vague &
ambiguous use of the word Capital even among political economists. I do
not think however that anyone entitled to the name of a political
economist ever confounds capital with money, or with the right to
receive money; however Edition: current; Page: [242] often that gross
blunder may be committed by the writers of “city articles in the Times”,
writers ignorant of the very elements of the subject. The phrases which
you cite as examples appear to me to arise from a confusion of another
sort, viz. the employment of both these words, money & capital, to
express loanable capital, or capital seeking investment, a misuse of
terms extremely frequent, & leading to the notion that the causes which
influence the loan market & the rate of interest have something to do
with the quantity of the currency, than which in my opinion no notion
can be more erroneous.

My own definition of capital is the portion of wealth which is destined
to be employed for the purpose of production; & my difference with you
on this point is well summed up in one sentence of your pamphlet (p.
43), where you say it is absurd that what is not capital should merely
by the altered intentions of its owner, become capital, without any
change in itself. I hold on the contrary that whether any given portion
of wealth is capital or not, is solely a question of the intentions of
its owners: just as it is wholly a question of the intentions of the
owner whether a given bushel of wheat is seed or food.

I perceive that you are not aware that I have treated the subjects of
your pamphlet at much length in my Princ of P.E.3 to which therefore I
can refer you for a fuller exposition of my opinions.

I am Sir yours very faithfully

time to do it over again for a correspondent. I will therefore only say
in answer to your last point,2 that if it is the actual use & not the

then there is no food until somebody eats it & no seed until it is sown.

Monsieur

Je vous demande pardon de n’avoir pas pû répondre plus tôt à votre
lettre du 25 septembre. Puisque M. Macaulay2 ne m’a pas remis la
traduction anglaise de votre essai avec l’essai même, il est à craindre
qu’elle ne soit perdue. Mais en supposant qu’elle me fût parvenue, je ne
saurais vraiment à qui m’adresser pour la faire imprimer. Le public
anglais est tellement en arrière du mouvement intellectuel Européen, que
les hautes spéculations historico-sociales ne sont ni goûtées ni
comprises, et j’ai peur qu’il ne se trouverait guère de lecteurs pour
une esquisse historique de ces spéculations, surtout faite par un
étranger, habitué à s’adresser à un public beaucoup mieux préparé à tout
égard. Il est plus que probable qu’un libraire qui en entreprendrait la
publication, en serait pour ses frais, et les directeurs de Edition:
current; Page: [244] journaux et de revues ne voudraient pas insérer la
traduction d’un écrit qui a déjà paru autre part. Ayant si peu d’espoir
de succès, je vous demande la permission de ne pas m’occuper des
nombreuses démarches qu’exigerait la tentative. Si le traducteur, ou
tout autre de vos amis, croit avoir des chances de réussite, il n’a qu’à
reclamer le manuscrit auprès de M. Macaulay, pour en faire l’usage qu’il
jugera devoir être le plus utile.

Il est très probable que je passerai une partie de l’hiver prochain en

My dear Sir—

I have been unable to answer earlier your note of the 10th of last
month, having only found time to read the book3 you were so kind as to
send me during a few days passed at this place before going abroad for
the winter.4

Mr Ferrier has the rare merit in a conversationalist, of complete
fairness. He understands the opinions of all the opponents whom he
notices, as fully & states them as clearly & forcibly as his own. He has
a very telling mode of discussion. His fabric of speculation is so
effectively constructed, & imposing, that it almost ranks as a work of
art. It is the romance of logic.

I should be very happy if I could add that I believed it had done, what
the author is firmly persuaded it has—solved the problem which all
philosophers from the first origin of speculation have been vainly
hammering at. On the contrary, it is depressing to me to see a man of so
much capacity under what appears to me so deep a delusion. Truly the
main hindrance of philosophy is not its intrinsic difficulties, great as
they are, but the extreme rarity of men who can reason. It is enough to
make one despair of speculation when a man of so much talent & knowledge
as this book displays & who piques himself peculiarly on his reasoning
faculty commits nearly every fallacy set down in books of logic & this
at all the most critical points of his argument. He says that whoever
admits his first proposition must admit all Edition: current; Page:
[247] the rest. I do not admit his first propn:5 but even if I did, his
first great paralogism as it seems to me consists in thinking that his
second proposition6 follows7 from his first, & there is a similar or a
still greater logical blunder each time that he makes any really fresh
advance in his argument. The whole system is one great specimen of
reasoning in a circle. Unless each successive conclusion is presupposed
it is impossible to admit the premisses in the sense in which alone they
can support it. All this I am satisfied I could prove to you, book in
hand, in an hour’s conversation. Before I had finished the book I
understood his mode of proceeding so well that I could generally see
before-hand in what manner he was going to beg the next question. The
effect is most disheartening, for when a writer who can so well point
out the fallacies of others builds an entire system of philosophy on
paralogising, what confidence is it possible to feel in avoiding them, &
how vain seems all hope that one has done or can do anything to help
these subjects forward. The only thing which alleviates this
discouragement is the belief that the author was from the first on a
wrong tack—as all metaphysicians, in my opinion, will be until they
leave off revolving in the eternal round of Descartes & Spinoza (of the
former of whom this book continually reminds me), & cease to imagine
that philosophy can be founded on “necessary truths of reason” or indeed
that there are such things as necessary truths—any at least which can be
known to be necessary in the metaphysical sense of the word. Pray excuse
the seeming crudity with which I have expressed the opinion you asked
from me—it has not been crudely formed.

I am Dear Sir very truly yours

My own darling—

keep me so till I have a dear delight of a word to overjoy me about a
week Edition: current; Page: [248] hence. To tell the dear one what she
wishes to know—I felt no cold, to speak of—none at all till I had got
full half way. I had some sandwiches at Swindon as we intended & enjoyed
the supper when I got to what will be home when its sun shines upon it
again. The fine sunny day made the country look extremely pretty as far
as Bath & beyond. The train arrived exact to its time. I called at
Pope’s3 but found him not at home—not out of town however—so left my
card with a few words in pencil. I stopt en chemin at Deane’s4 to buy a
trowel, but they had never heard of such a thing as a trowel that folds
up! so I must do without. I found Mrs Lynes5 & her husband both
here—they had received the note & done everything right. The shoemaker
sent a man who put the strap in order quickly & effectually. After
emptying the red bag I locked it & put it in its old place under the
bed—& as there is now nothing in it (except Ross’s6 gloves) I have, in
case it should be wanted, put the (padlock) key in one of the table
drawers in my room. I forgot to return the big medical book to Dr Royle7
before we left & am rather afraid to leave that to the people here lest
they should make some mistake between that & the library parcel—if you
find it here darling when your darling self comes back, please return it
directed Dr Royle, India House.

As long as I was in sight of the same sea which she sees from her window
I did not feel separated—it gave me a pang when I lost sight of it—but I
am & shall be cheerful. This is hardly worth writing but perhaps she
would rather have it than none. I shall write very soon.

With every possible kind of the utmost love—

I am here darling at our old quarters in the Hotel du Loiret & shall not
get on any further tonight. I have had two days of little
misadventures—in the Edition: current; Page: [249] first place dismal
weather yesterday & today, though tonight it looks as if it might
perhaps clear for tomorrow—then a very rough passage which made me very
sea sick—I can almost say I knew for the first time what seasickness is,
having had violent pains in the abdomen along with the most excessive
sickness. When the boat stopt I was as you appear to be in the same
case—I could hardly totter up the steps & had besides a bad return of
sickness on the quay. However all this left me in the course of the
evening. The next thing is that the effetti must have been excessively
knocked about on the steamer—perhaps only by the extreme pitching of the
ship—but when they came to be opened at the douane, the large
portmanteau was found unlocked, having lost precisely what the smaller
one lost at Boulogne before—a very strange effect to come from knocking
about—however I miss nothing and do not suspect foul play. Not only was
the lid of the cod liver oil box split lengthwise but one of the bottles
was broken & had spilt a good deal of the oil—happily spoiling nothing
but the red leather cover of my writing book. When I opened the dressing
case the earthenware tray which it contains was also broken. I suppose
all this happened because the portmanteau though full was not tightly
pressed & squeezed down from overfullness as it usually is & therefore
could not stand the knocking about. No further harm happened to any of
the things on their land journey thus far, & I must go on as I can with
them. The necessity of getting the lock mended obliged me to stay this
morning at Paris which in any case it would have been disagreeable after
arriving at 12 o’clock to leave at 8.40, the latest train which would
have taken me to Poitiers today—so I waited for the 1 oclock train which
would have taken me to Tours tonight in the dark by a slow train but it
was pleasanter to stop here & take the express tomorrow at 11/9. I think
I shall stop at Libourne as it is a place I have not seen & so get to
Bordeaux by daylight the morning after. It may perhaps be fine by that
time. Even Paris looked its very worst—dark, soaked & uncomfortable. The
new street to the Hotel de Ville is now all but finished—the houses all
built & occupied except just by the Louvre where they have pulled down
all the houses between it & the Rue St Honoré & are rebuilding them. The
fine old Gothic tower of St Jacques la Boucherie will be the centre of a
place—they are restoring it as they are all the old monuments in France.
The oldest of the old, & blackest of the black, the Palais de Justice
now looks like a new building, to its great loss in my opinion. I went
to the Bedford which was comfortable but by no means cheap. I passed
your or rather our Hotel de France which was pleasant to see—as it is
pleasant to be in this inn where we have been. Yesterday in the railway
I was afraid that I was getting into that half mad state which always
makes me say that imprisonment would kill me—& which makes me conscious
that if I let myself dwell on the idea I could get into the state of
being unable to bear the impossibility of flying to the moon—it is a
part of human nature I never saw described but have long known by
Edition: current; Page: [250] experience—this time the occasion of it
was, not being able to get to you—when I reflected that for more than
six months I was to be where I could not possibly go to you in less than
many days, I felt as if I must instantly turn back & return to you. It
will require a good deal of management of myself to keep this sensation
out of my nerves. I hope next time I write to have something better to
tell than a heap of petits malheurs. I must not forget to say that Mrs
Lynes2 (who was very attentive) produced before I went her account of
the comestibles she had bought for me amounting to eighteen-pence
besides 3d postage on the Adelaide paper & said they were short of
money, so I paid her the 1/9 & also 1/8 to cover the parcels money—I
made up & directed the medical book to Dr Royle3 & left the library
books for her to make up & I thought one might be 8d & the other a
shilling but perhaps not so much. I told her to keep the account & give
it to you when you return. This letter is worth nothing anima mia but to
tell her that I have got safely thus far. I have got some books from a
library to read this evening & so get through this dull part of the
time. Adieu delight of my life.

My own precious one, I have no more disasters to tell of—it has been
very fine weather these two days, though rather cold. Snow fell in the
night at Orleans but it melted in the morning & I was not the least cold
during the journey in consequence of the nice mode of warming the first
class carriages. A man told me on the way to Dover that one English
railway, the Great Northern, has adopted this plan: I am sure it is an
ample reason for going by that way to the south in the winter half of
the year. The railway journey was pretty, especially near Poitiers &
there was an agreeable German, of Lubeck, in the carriage whom I had a
little talk with—also a young naval officer who had just got leave of
absence to see his relations at Angoulême while his ship the Austerlitz
is refitting at Cherbourg (having been damaged in the Baltic); his
extreme delight made him speak with enthusiasm of everything, especially
Hamburg which he seemed to think the most splendid place in the world.
He was taking a Russian sheepskin cloak to his vieux père. I Edition:
current; Page: [251] stopped at Libourne as I intended & had a walk
about it this morning—the best thing there is the bridge of the
Dordogne, the view from which is really fine. It was getting into
cheapness again—for a thé complet, breakfast with eggs & bed the charge
was 4 francs which with half a franc to the waiter was the whole
expense. There was ice in the streets & it is sharp today though not
sufficiently to be unpleasant. I came on to Bordeaux in a bright sun,
always in sight of one of the two fine rivers & have now been strolling
about Bordeaux for several hours—it is quite as pleasant & handsome a
town as I remember it—but I find it is more difficult to leave it than
to get to it, all the diligences being night ones. There is one to
Toulouse at 1 oclock in the day reaching Toulouse at 10 next morning but
by this they will not book to any place short of Toulouse! & they say
chance places are seldom to be had. I do not know if I shall close with
this or take my chance of a place part of the way & go on next day by a
different diligence. In any case this will not be till Wednesday for I
shall give tomorrow to La Teste. I have not gone to our old Hotel de
France but to the Hotel du Midi which is in a much better street & of
which I liked the advertisement. I have seen the cathedral & another
large church—neither of them very fine. The restoring is going on here
as it is every where else in France—to the great indignation of
Ruskin2—& I dare say the new figures of saints round the entrances &c &c
are not so good as the old were, but of that I am not much of a judge &
care very little about it—but what I can perceive is the extremely bad
effect produced by their restoring a part at a time, a single window
perhaps of a high tower—which looks bright & white in the midst of a
dark time stained building producing false unnatural & ugly lights &
shades & destroying the effect of the true. It is a very cheerful
looking town & not nearly so modern in appearance as I fancied it in
recollection. I have seen the large fine theatre outside & intend to see
it inside this evening. The air here is about half way between the
English air when one calls it particularly clear—as often in March—& the
real southern air—but it was charming after the damp weather although
much sharper than at Torquay—perhaps however there is now a north wind
at Torquay too. I do hope she will not feel it much at Highfield. I have
had the good luck to find here, when in search of a Tasso, all the four
poets in one volume,3 not too large to go in the pocket nor too small
print to read by ordinary light—it cost 7½ francs & is a very good
investment of the money. I stupidly left my little ivory memorandum
tablets at home & have not been able to find another here at an
admissible price. I feel the inconvenience of being without Edition:
current; Page: [252] it. This letter has hardly anything in it worth
sending but it is a pleasure to write it & it will be a pleasure to her
to hear that I am going on well. I shall have more to tell of perhaps
next time & then more & more afterwards—I dream almost every night that
I am with her or that she is travelling with me. Adieu my darling
darling more precious than ever love.

My darling one perhaps hardly expects to hear again so soon, but the
best time to write is when I have a spare half hour. I went to La Teste
yesterday in a middling day & had six hours consecutive walking there,
on the beach & in the pine forest. La Teste itself is a rather shabby
village but about a mile from it, is the watering place Arcachon by
name, really a tolerable turn out for a French watering place. It lies
along the coast, in one road or street which I thought I should never
get to the end of—nearly two miles it must be—the houses on one side
looking to the sea & on the other to a long ridge covered with pine
woods, almost close to the houses—it is empty now but the quantity of
hotels & lodging houses (mostly in the pavilion form) is immense—horses
& carriages to be had every where & some large architectural looking
private houses built or building—for the whole place looks quite new &
is rapidly spreading along the coast. The worst is that its sea is to
the north for it is not the real sea but an inlet or basin as broad as
the broadest parts of the Solent, or broader—but the real sea is soon
reached from it. After going a long way by the sea I returned by the
pine forest which seems to cover the whole line of coast here & in which
I was near losing myself. It is really fine—a succession of bold ridges
covered with a pine, not the stone pine but like very fine Scotch fir,
full of paths, & where you continually come out on points from which you
see across deep woody ravines to other bold woody hills. The underwood
where there is any, is tall broom & a sort of tree-like heath, inland,
but towards the sea it is arbutus in profuse quantity & splendid flower.
According to my recollections of Murray,2 this railway, he pretended,
went through the hills of Medoc but it is entirely false. Edition:
current; Page: [253] You get directly on the Grandes Landes, which until
near the sea are a dead flat & alternate between pine woods & open very
wet looking heaths on which I unexpectedly saw in two places, the men we
read about, clothed in sheep-skins & mounted on stilts. The day was
altogether as pleasant as was consistent with only moderately good
weather & a state, in myself, not at all enjoying—the causes of which
are probably in part physical, & the long walk of yesterday which has
evidently done me much good will I dare say partly remove them. As yet I
have not been able to enjoy anything much & yesterday as I was returning
in the railway carriage I felt that I must say to my darling that she
must not be surprised if she finds any day that I am on my way the very
shortest way home. Now I have said it I feel relieved & probably shall
be able to go on without. It is evident that the journey even now is
doing me good as to health—I was weighed this morning just as I was at
Torquay & the result (66½ kilos) shews an increase of more than 2 lbs
since, which is very much for the time exactly a week. It is a still
duller day today though not actually raining & I am not sorry that I
took my place right through to Toulouse though it will give me tonight
for travelling & the day tomorrow at Toulouse where I do not want to
stay. That makes it unlucky that we did not arrange for a letter at
Toulouse as I do long for the first word from her. I shall soon be in
the real south & I shall get her first letter at the moment of arriving
there. I went to the grand théâtre which is for operas & ballets—very
large & fine with gilding & painting, but the boxes all hanging like
separate balconies without any support under them which seems to me very
ugly. After one of the usual absurd & immoral little pieces there was a
ballet called Grenadilla3 which I quite expect will be to be seen in
London—all ballets are dull but some of the scenery & even the dancing
in this were prettier than usual & if it were not for the noise which
the French presume to call music it would be pleasant. There are seldom
any newspapers at the inns but local ones but I see from those that
things make little progress in the Crimea. I learnt from one this
morning qu’on voit en angleterre de nobles ladys confectionner de leurs
blanches mains des masses de plummpuddings [sic] pour les soldats de
Lord Raglan.4 When I put this letter in the post I shall ask if there
are any for me though I do not expect any & shall then go to a salon de
lecture for the first time to learn some verités de cette [force?] là.
Adieu my darling—I dare say I shall write from Toulouse tomorrow but
perhaps I may have the luck to be able to leave immediately. Adieu con
tutti gli amori et baci possibili.

I begin writing this evening my darling though I probably shall not
finish & send off the letter from this place. Instead of arriving at 10
in the morning the diligence brought me here sometime after dark—in a
most dismal day—it rained very much in the night & has been all today
like the worst November day (barring fog) in England—but (the
satisfactory circumstance is) not cold—I did not feel cold at all in the
coupé though it was not full—only one person besides me, who by the bye
had not much conversation though he professed to have travelled
immensely, as all the persons with whom I have conversed in this journey
have done. The German I told you of had seen Niagara, & was just
returning from South America, not having been at home for several years.
I am not at our old place which seems not to be known by its name
now—they call this where I am (the Hotel de l’Europe in the Place
Lafayette) Hotel Bibent now, saying that M. Bibent keeps it. I am very
comfortable here, luckily as I have caught a bad cold. I suppose the
immense chill, almost amounting to an ague fit, which I had at La Teste
soon after coming in from my long walk (much heated by quick walking,
not to be benighted in the forest) was not wholly as I thought at the
time, the effect of my complaint, but was the sign & consequence of
catching this cold. I am glad to find that I can get off tomorrow at ten
in the forenoon & to avoid night travelling. I shall go no further
tomorrow than Carcassonne. It is not far to Narbonne after that & the
change to a southern climate is somewhere about Carcassonne which
corresponds here to Valence in the Rhone Valley. I believe I passed in
the night through some pretty country about La Réole & Agen: there was
some very pretty this morning along the base of a line of hills by a
road raised somewhat above a broad valley or rather plain in which the
Garronne winds beautifully—how splendidly the southwest of France is
provided with rivers. All the affluents of the Garronne are large &
fine, the Dordogne, Tarn, Lot &c. The rest of the country which I saw
both near Bordeaux & here was dull & uninteresting enough, at least in
winter. I am beginning to think what I shall take in hand to write
during this journey—we were to have discussed that, but forgot to do it
& I am a good deal puzzled what to fix upon—it would be a pity to do
nothing all this long time & I expect to have plenty of evenings on my
hands especially when I become stationary anywhere. Perhaps my darling
will suggest something—she may conceive but I am sure she does not know
what a difference it makes in the Edition: current; Page: [255]
possibility of any verve in writing on a subject & even in the capacity
of writing about it at all, for it to have been of her dear suggesting.
I was constantly falling asleep for moments in the diligence & dreaming
directly of her—the dream mixing oddly with reality as for example, I
dreamt that I was seated by her in a carriage with four places with Lily
sitting facing us as usual & could not make out in my dream how we came
to be three when just before I was sure we had been only two in the
carriage—at other times dreaming of much finer scenery than I was
passing through. She will not lose anything by not getting this letter
directly. I hope I shall be able to tell her of bright skies before I
send it. As yet I have only had that once, the day I arrived at
Bordeaux.

Carcassonne. Dec. 15. I have just got here, my beauty, at about nine in
the evening. It has been another gloomy day, without actual rain, but
the roads everywhere soaking with wet. This line of road goes all the
way through a kind of valley which extends from one to the other sea but
for a long way after Toulouse the heights are very distant & tame. There
was nothing fine till (a little before dark) we reached Castelnaudary, a
town spread out on the top & sides of an eminence rising in the middle
of the valley in question which is here on the broad scale which French
scenery so often is—the town looks one way over what seems a vast valley
to some very high ground called the Montagnes Noires, forming the
termination of the Cevennes at this end, & the other way to some bolder
& nearer confused ridges which rise behind one another towards the
Pyrenees. In fine weather no doubt the Pyrenees can be seen. I dare say
there is fine country between that place & this but the night concealed
it. The people all look well off & so do the animals: all the way from
Bordeaux there is a splendid breed of cattle like those in the Pontine
marshes, & the geese are so enormous that they seem intended to be eaten
by beings superior to men. One sees however perfectly here what people
mean when they talk of the inferiority of French agriculture. There are
scarcely any ploughs, all is done by hand—digging or rather hoeing with
instruments like these

[lf0223-14-inlineimg01.png] or [lf0223-14-inlineimg02.png]

which it is quite painful to see them work with—accordingly the green
corn is hardly more advanced than it was a month ago in England & most
of the land is not yet prepared for seed at all—if it were not for their
mild winter they could not get their corn into the ground till spring.
It is very curious to look at the faces of a crowd in one of these
towns—a great many faces very beautiful—many quite idiotic—most of them
characteristic in some way & every now & then one (generally a woman) so
deeply tragic as hardly any English face is capable of being. Having so
much physiognomy as the French Edition: current; Page: [256] have no
wonder they are physiognomists. People seem to me to talk less about the
government than they did a year ago—they neither speak for nor against
it—& they do not talk half as much about the war2 as people in England
do. I was asked for my passport at Castelnaudary for the second time
after landing—the first being at the inn at Paris, & with apologies,
merely as they said to take down the name. Nowhere else have the inn
people asked my name & they have nowhere produced a book. I find I can
get on to Narbonne tomorrow in the middle of the day, which will give me
time for a walk here & to see the place. I have had no walk yet,
deserving the name, except the one at La Teste. By the bye in what I
said about the pine forests I did not mention the use they are put to.
Great numbers of trees have a large piece of bark sliced off near the
bottom, where the turpentine exudes & drying up becomes a large white
cake of considerable thickness. The woods belong to the government & are
advertised pin maritime à gommer mort, or à gommer vif, as it happens.
The landlord at Toulouse is the man who had the Hotel Bibent which last
still exists but is called Hotel de Paris. The Place du Capitole is all
remis à neuf—they were I think in 1849 pulling down the side opposite to
the Capitole—that is now a long Palais Royal like affair with arcades, &
the other two sides exactly like it, arcades excepted, looking bran new,
très magnifique, & of a desolating sameness. They have now named the Rue
& Place Lafayette, Rue & Place Louis Napoleon but I perceive the people
still use the old names. My cold is getting better. Goodbye darling—I
shall get her beautiful writing tomorrow which is next (though far
removed) to her beautiful self.

My precious love, after I had put my letter in the post at Narbonne I
walked about the town & in the neighbourhood in the most delightful
sunshine & temperature though with a great deal of wind: a man here
said, we have almost always du vent only rarely a calm (une bonace).
Nothing can be seen of the sea nor even of the lagunes (here called
étangs) which come close up to the town, & though there are heights &
ridges at no great distance there are no rocks visible except a sort of
mural line along the top of a long ridge which closes the view
southwest, through which there are gaps evidently Edition: current;
Page: [257] made by water washing the precipice away. As the country is
cultivated to the top of the heights there is no beauty at this season
except what the climate gives; it is all bare earth or scarcely visible
stubble, the olives being scattered & poor—nevertheless it was very
pleasant after the northern stay. These southern towns have mostly low
houses so that when seen from without they seem to crouch at the foot of
the lofty cathedral forming an apt image of middle age hierarchy. By the
bye the people in all this country are either most strenuous catholics
or their religion has received a great fillip from the cholera, for in
all the towns I have lately passed through, most of the houses, great or
small, are placarded with printed papers imploring the intercession of
Marie conçue sans péché & occasionally of St Roch, the latter usually
requested to preserve them from the cholera. I enjoyed the walk & even
got a few plants—all along the road, afterwards I passed among the dead
carcasses of so many fine plants that I would gladly have found living.
The hedges here are mostly of that grey coloured maritime-looking shrub
which is so much planted about Torquay—nice Torquay!2 how I have conned
over all its localities in the bit of England that is in our map of
France & which gives the outline of that coast really well. I soon found
there was little more to be seen of Narbonne & determined to omit
Perpignan on the principle of leaving something for another time—it
would come so well into a Pyrenean tour which we shall make perhaps some
day if we live & are strong enough. So I came on to Beziers by a
diligence which leaves at two & arrived at ½ past 4 & notwithstanding
the wind, made myself very comfortable in the banquette. There were
mountains at no great distance to the left all the way, which & the
passes through them were evidently very fine, but it was plain that most
abominable weather was going forward there, & now & then the tail of a
cloud from that quarter brushed over us & gave a few drops of
rain—looking back to Narbonne I more than suspected that the place was
having its first rain for a year past if the man told truth—another man
said, il ne pleut jamais ici, pour ainsi dire jamais. Beziers is a nice
town on a steep hill, with a nice new part & a nice old part. I went to
the theatre there, tempted by an opera, La Favorite,3 which was really
very well sung and acted—but the pit was the most boisterous assemblage
I ever was in—perhaps the day, Sunday, had something to do with that. I
had the theatre for nothing, as it cost me exactly what I should
otherwise have paid for fire, being one franc: at Narbonne they wanted
to make me pay 1½ franc. At Beziers the charge for dinner & bed, the
former a large table d’hôte, the bed as good as anywhere & the bedroom
very decent, was three Edition: current; Page: [258] francs. I have
found no such low charge anywhere else. I left at six this morning for
Montpellier & arrived there at two. The night had been splendid, the
stars even brighter I think than at Nice, & the early part of the day
was exquisite, but the mountains enveloped in rain & at last the clouds
gradually collected everywhere—it became as dull a day as in England,
except that even in dull days here there is a transparency in the air
which we never or very seldom see in England. When I got here it had
just begun to rain & promises to do so all the evening which is the
reason I am writing. I had meant to walk about till dark & chat with my
darling in the evening. There will be no letters yet but I shall ask for
them directly to familiarize messieurs du bureau with the idea. I am in
what is called the best hotel, Hotel Nevet, a large place in the best
situation in the town, & by good luck the landlady who pretends to speak
English, apologized (as her premier was full) for giving me a ground
floor room which suits me the best in the house, with a direct outlet to
the esplanade through a garden, very nicely furnished & comfortable, the
cost being two francs. I shall stay here several days, till I have seen
all the old places & all those I had not seen which are worth seeing & I
shall take the opportunity at the same time of recommencing the cod
liver oil which I suspended during the journey. I have several times
read a little of Tasso,4 to the benefit I hope of my Italian, for I do
not seem likely to derive any other pleasure or profit from it—it seems
to me the most prosaic of prose & I do not think that this is only from
not liking the subject of the Jerusalem, nor what is called romantic
poetry in general. Fortunately the same volume contains Dante who with
Filicaja5 & perhaps Alfieri6 seem to me as far as I know the only
Italian poets—but I shall try the Aminta7 which is perhaps better & I
suppose I must attempt a little of Petrarch especially if I go to
Vaucluse. I have a great respect for him as one of the principal
restorers of ancient & founders of modern literature but I cannot say
the little I have read of his writings or know of his life interests me
much. It now pours, & I shall probably get wet in going to the post but
I must do so as for aught I know it may save a day—letters however go
quick from here as it is almost all railway. A propos the Bordeaux &
Cette line was in sight all the way making rapid progress in all parts &
almost finished in some—also the Canal du Midi the great work of
Colbert8 which is made very ornamental by its windings & by a broad
Edition: current; Page: [259] towing path planted on both sides all the
way with trees—mostly planes, which are the staple as though they lose
their leaves in winter they do not in summer, as most of the deciduous
trees do here, thus failing when shade is wanted. But the plane has like
the Australian trees the bad habit of stripping itself of its bark &
exposing itself stark naked, or with a few fragments of clothing hanging
in rags about it. All the towns, this included, look at a distance just
like the grey limestone they are made of which also stands out of the
ground in blocks like the houses of some of the dwarfs in Tieck’s9 fairy
tales. Does not my treasure find my letters very rambling. I write
things just when & where they come into my head—how I long for the next
letter, but it would not be written I am afraid till yesterday—however
as I said it will come quick. Will my darling kiss her next letter just
in the middle of the first line of writing—the kiss will come safe & I
shall savourer it. Adieu darling

I have had but a poor specimen of this climate, my beauty—the first day
it rained heavily all the afternoon & evening—the second was brilliant
but there was such a violent north wind that I sometimes could hardly
stand against it & had to hold my hat on & walk stooping—& this morning
when I awoke it was snowing hard—& though the snow soon melted in most
places, on the promenades there was still some left late in the
afternoon. So you see, first it blew, then it snew & then it thew, &
perhaps tomorrow I may have to say then it friz. The people say that
there was no rain in November this year & it is just like our ill luck
last year that it should have come now. In spite of this I was on foot
yesterday from soon after daylight till dark, with the sole intermission
of breakfast. The country is not beautiful but peculiar—like no other I
ever saw—much as my recollections made it—but the rocky waste which
chiefly composed it formerly is in many places changed to vineyards &
olive grounds. The limestone of this country is hard, but moulders into
very tolerable soil & if people will take the trouble to dig out with
pickaxe & shovel the hard blocks they generally find soil enough hanging
about them to plant in & the stone itself does to build with & is burnt
into lime for mortar. I found many large spaces inclosed by walls
Edition: current; Page: [260] & containing houses & grounds where I only
remember garrigues (as they call these wastes) so multiplying the little
campagnes which dot the whole country round the town as at Nice or
Marseille. I walked out 12 kilometres on the road I best knew, being
that which leads to the chateau formerly of the Benthams2—but which has
ceased to be theirs these twenty years & more—I found my recollections
in no material point inaccurate. This road must be quite the finest
which leads out of Montpellier—it goes direct towards the foot of the
Pic St Loup the only mountain very conspicuous from the town & the
approaches to which lie over & among rocky heights & I came to several
views very like & fit for Salvator.3 The town itself is much the same
except that it is very much cleaner, better paved, & has many new
buildings—like all towns in these days it has evidently become
manufacturing & the outskirts are crowded with works of different sorts,
of which one effect is that the clearness of the sky is now much
tarnished by coal smoke—for the place having a railway right into the
heart of one of the chief coal basins of France has taken to burning a
great deal of coal (& sometimes also le cock as they pronounce it).
Hence the promenade du Peyrou on the top of the hill which the town
covers, still the finest promenade for situation & beauty I ever saw
(the water which supplies the town is brought to this promenade by an
aqueduct of two rows of arches spanning a great valley) now looks across
smoke towards the sea, & only on the side towards the mountains has its
beautiful clearness. I have not yet had weather to see the Pyrenees from
it, as can always be done when there is fine weather in that direction.
Today I have gone very little out of the town, the roads being sloppy
with the snow. If my own recollections did not confirm it, I should
think the people here were in a conspiracy to tell lies in defence of
their climate. They say it hardly ever snows (two people have told me
they saw snow here today for the first time) & that it sometimes does
not rain for 18 months but this it seems is the season of the high
winds. The wind yesterday though due north direct from the mountains &
so strong & though I was walking right against it was not, I am bound to
say, cold—& today it is warm but not so warm as it was at Torquay when I
was there. Tell me dearest when you write what weather you had at the
same time. Today I saw the picture gallery all new since I was here & I
should think the best to be found in any provincial town in France,
founded by a painter named Edition: current; Page: [261] Fabre,4 who
spent in collecting pictures all of his life which was not employed in
painting them, & gave them all to his native town, since which two other
people have given their galleries to add to it. They are mostly
originals, many of them of the best painters & some very fine. Either
the same or someone else also gave a large library to the town, which is
kept in the same building. On the whole the place must be pleasant,
having always had very good literary & scientific society & the usual
share of other—as somebody in Chamfort said of some place, la bonne
société y est comme partout, et la mauvaise y est excellente. Living
must be cheap—at a large butcher’s shop I was told that beef, mutton &
veal were severally 10, 11, & 14 sous the lb, best parts & best quality
(the woman asked more when she thought I was a buyer & when they
understood my object the man evidently made a conscience of telling me
the truth). For good sized fowls I was asked 15 sous—they must be still
cheaper at Toulouse (I wish I had asked) that country being said to be
the head quarters of fowldom, & I passed on the road repeatedly
waggonloads of hencoops full of them laden top heavy like hay waggons in
England, which a fellow traveller said were going from Toulouse to
Marseilles not for the fleet but for the ordinary supply of the town.
This seems as if in Provence as at Nice the peasants did not keep fowls
as profusely as they do elsewhere in France. For plump little turkeys
the woman who had the fowls asked 4½ francs but this was only her first
word. The meat I can positively say is excellent if I may judge from
this table d’hôte—which is by many degrees the best I ever dined at—all
the dishes of good quality, well cooked & in profusion & what is more
uncommon, the most perfect order, rapidity & polite attention in the
serving—though thirty or forty are always there, every one is
individually asked to take of every dish, the waiters having an immense
variety of civil formulas with which they offer it as a master of the
house would to his guests. The servants of all sorts are all pleasant
mannered people & the whole thing gives one a high idea of the old lady
who manages it. I have a very comfortable room, & the rest from
travelling is very pleasant & useful—not that I was physically overdone
but mentally. This evening when I have finished this letter I have my
plant papers to change & dry, my Italian to read (Aminta is not such
dull work, quite, as the Gerusalemme) & a novel to finish with. There is
here a nice library & salon littéraire where I get books & read the
papers—they always have Galignani & occasionally get the Post or
Chronicle. I was agreeably surprised at seeing the Post & not the Times.
Tomorrow I shall perhaps get another precious letter. I have asked each
Edition: current; Page: [262] day of the very civil people. Altogether I
like the place, but it is not beautiful enough nor quite a good enough
climate for one to wish to choose it as a place to live in. I wish
though that my darling had seen it with me & hope we shall come here
some day together. I will finish by saying that the cod liver oil I am
sure is an excellent thing for me, for I never had digested perfectly
since I left it off, & have from the very first day I resumed it—a
thousand loves & kisses to my own divine treasure.

You see dearest angel that I am here still, but I leave for Nîmes
tomorrow. I got her second letter yesterday morning on the way to the
railroad & it is quite painful to think of her being worried & put out
of spirits & the benefit of the change in great part lost by that most
unsuitable companionship—it is always so—when you are for any time with
the grand’mère2 your feelings & conscience are always revolted & nerves
set on edge. You have said the truest of words—always dupe de votre
cœur—you thought she felt declining & had the natural wish to give what
she would feel agreeable, but you are not physically fit for that now—&
why should you throw yourself away on one for whom Caroline is not only
good enough but pleasanter to her than you. Why did you do it & why did
I not try to dissuade you. If it was but to be soon over—but two months
are such a terrible length of time. I shall be as glad now to know you
safe at home as I was glad to think that you were in that nice
place—nice before but spoilt in idea now by that presence. I have not
much to tell—I should have written directly after reading her letter if
I had not known that she would in the meantime have received several of
mine which would shew that I was feeling more comfortable. I am getting
on very well & shall do well enough—different somehow from the summer
journey—I was then what people call much more out of spirits, that is I
thought badly of my prospects as to health which now I do not—but then I
was active & buoyant, mentally, & liked to talk to all sorts of
people—now I feel no disposition to it & generally am silent at tables
d’hôte & even with fellow travellers (after a few words have been said
to shew friendliness) unless they shew a desire to talk. This they
seldom do—the French are now a much more silent people than the English.
Among perhaps Edition: current; Page: [263] forty people at table there
will not be six who say anything & these generally only to their own
party & but little to them. I have seen hardly any English: at Béziers
there were two, but they aspired to being fast & I kept aloof from them.
There are three or four in this inn, & some of them are said to dine at
the table d’hôte but I do not distinguish them by sight or tongue—though
I do one or two Germans. As for my proceedings—I went yesterday by the
railway to Cette, which I found little worth seeing—a seaport is always
ugly & a small one worse than a large, because you cannot get away from
the port. But this sky makes everything look well. I walked back 29
kilometers (18 miles) & should not have been at all tired had it not
been again a day of violent wind (though otherwise very fine) & in the
whole distance I could never, for fear of losing my hat, walk for any
consecutive five minutes upright—I could only see the view by
occasionally looking up, with my hand firmly attached to my hat. This is
not pleasant—my neighbour yesterday at dinner told me there is always
wind here, & a waiter to whom I have just spoken thinks nothing of this
wind, & says it will be the same all January & February & much worse in
March—a nice place for consumption! but the wind is not cold, only
troublesome. The waiter said if there were only more rain here the pays
would be trop riche. Today par merveille there has been but little wind
(though we should call it anywhere else a fresh breeze) & a fine sky
though with many beautiful clouds. The mountains are loaded with masses
of cloud every day & all day & there must be torrents of rain there.
Today I have walked about & taken a moderately long walk out in the
garrigues. I like when a place is at all interesting to stay long enough
there to carry away a permanent image of it which I am sure is correct,
which one never does of a place one only passes through. This place if
it would but cease blowing, would gain on one extremely—I never saw
anything more lovely than the Peyrou & its view this evening just after
sunset, & from something different I suppose in the state of the air I
saw none of the smoke I mentioned before—everything was pure & the tone
that of the finest Poussin.3 At the gallery I had great pleasure in
seeing an exceedingly nice painting of Pau with the castle & mountains.
I shall stay I suppose two nights at Nimes, there is much to see there
but I shall see tomorrow the Arènes, Maison Carrée &c & next day go to
the Pont de Gard—on foot if possible. Adieu my precious—there is never a
day an hour or a minute when I am not wishing for her. There is no doubt
another letter on the way to Marseilles—there would perhaps be time for
still another there, but to make sure I will rather say, write to Genoa
the day she receives this if it is quite convenient. I will ask there if
I do not find two at Marseilles. Adieu again mio bene.

I wrote yesterday my darling & she will get this by the same post. I
write again to thank her for such a sweet note (No. 3) & to send a
letter I have just received from Pope.2 There seems to have been a
malentendu altogether. He means to go to the south of France in the very
worst months & asks me to tell him where. I do not know any place that
would suit him except Hyères or Pau (perhaps Cannes?) & I hate to send
him to either. I shall not write to him till I hear from you. Pisa, Rome
or Malta are the places for him but he evidently does not like going
alone to Italy on account of the language. Malta I had suggested to him
before. I am so happy that even in those most depressing & irritating
circumstances her health has still improved. Mille mille baci.

We thought of being at Florence today my dearest & I am only here—but
that was when I thought of leaving England sooner than the 8th. Last
Christmas Day we were together at Hyères, a day I shall never forget—now
I am not far from the same place but without the delight of my life. She
knows I wish her every good that can possibly be wished at this time & a
happy meeting in the warm weather six months hence unless I am happy
enough for it to be sooner by her coming to meet me. How unlike this day
to the last I spent here—about the same time of year: but it makes as
fine time now as it made villain time then. I little thought that the
place where I should first in this journey fully taste the pleasure of
existence would be Avignon—if I had not come here I should not have
known what a splendidly beautiful place it is. The Promenade des
Rochers, close to the Cathedral—in these southern towns they always
contrive to have a fine promenade in the finest situation—from this
promenade on the summit of the town there is a complete panorama all
round, commanding a fine Vega encircled on all sides by mountains with
the snowy Mont Ventoux the foremost of them & through this three great
rivers winding viz. the Rhone below the town & its two enormous and
widely diverging branches above this under the Edition: current; Page:
[265] splendidest of skies & suns & with the temperature of a fine day
at the beginning of October. I could have spent the whole day with
pleasure merely pacing the two long bridges across the two branches of
the Rhone. I arrived here from Nimes about 12 & walked about till nearly
dark which is not till after 5, for the winter days are longer & the
summer days shorter in these latitudes. It will be lovely going to
Vaucluse tomorrow. The most prominent object at Nimes is the Arènes,
about half the size of the Colosseum but much more perfect at least
externally—it forms the centre of a great place & my window looked out
on it—& it looked finer at night than in the day. Here too I had two
splendid days, with no more wind than was agreeable, though not quite
equal to this day at Avignon. The Maison Carrée is a very nice graceful
temple, Greek not Roman though of the Roman times, & in perfect
preservation. They have made the interior a picture gallery & museum &
there are some good pictures. There are in the town some other Roman
antiquities but only like the nameless ones one finds everywhere in the
Campagna—also an old Roman tower on the top of a hill, the ascent to
which is a nicely planted promenade & from the top of which is a
splendid view of the town & country. Nimes consists of boulevards with
shops & houses in the Paris stile encircling an old town somewhat like
the old part of Nice. For my part I am coming to like the modern parts
best. It is not the uncomfortable squalid oldness of the buildings that
makes the French towns so delightful—it is the infinitely varying
physiognomy, & that is as perfect in the boulevards of Paris & Nimes as
in the oldest recesses of either. I went yesterday to the Pont du
Gard—being 22 kilometres, it was too far to go & return on foot but a
cabriolet with a good horse only cost 10 francs. This day gave me a
picture for life. The Pont is an aqueduct of three tiers of arches
crossing a ravine at an immense height—almost perfectly preserved, even
to the conduit which conveyed the water & which I walked into & a good
way along though I could not quite stand upright. Against the lowest
tier of arches was built, 100 years ago, a bridge to carry a road across
but it is a bye road—the place is most retired & on the other side of
the Pont nothing is seen but the old stonework. Beyond is the loveliest
& wildest ravine winding among ilex & other bushes, along the middle of
which runs the purest of all crystal streams. I had a glorious walk up
the ravine to an old feudal chateau with high machicolated towers.
Everything looks so splendid under this sky, though today is the first
in which I have had perfect physical comfort—all the other bright days
there has been too much wind though they thought nothing of it at Nimes
& said it always blows there. The cathedrals in these towns are mere
common churches like that at Nice. The one at Montpellier has nothing
remarkable but a porch which from its height & the size of its two
pillars seems built by & for giants. I went into a church here & found a
man preaching with Edition: current; Page: [266] great vehemence a
metaphysical & philosophical sermon, shewing that science (of which he
really seemed to know something) can explain & understand very
little—wherefore incomprehensibility ought not to hinder us from
believing.—I sent her from Montpellier Pope’s letter. His plan now is
that I should not have him for any part of the time I might have liked
to have him, & should have him in Greece where I would much rather not,
since I shall there see more or less of people with whom he would be
merely in the way. I should have liked well enough to have him in Sicily
but you see he gives up that & I feel inclined to shirk him altogether
but do not know the best way. However I need only at present tell him
where to direct to me if he writes. I have no idea where to advise him
to go.

I shall go to Marseilles darling the day after tomorrow & shall write as
soon as I have been to the post office & fixed by what steamer to leave.
If this weather holds, the journey will be very pleasant. It evidently
rains or snows very much in the mountains, as is shewn by the muddiness
of the Rhone. I cannot make up my mind whether to call on Mr Pasquale
Villari or not at Florence & also whether to leave my card with Bulwer.2
Adieu my darling of darlings. The people were going about everywhere so
cheerful & gay this fine fête day.

I found her dear dear letter on arriving today my own cherished one.
What good her letters do me—this one has put me quite into spirits
because of her being so well (considering the circumstances) & because
she has fine weather & likes the place—she makes me like it again, the
dear one does, but I long for the time when she will go out & enjoy
it—how often I realize those nice walks & drives about there & I think I
like them quite as much as any place I have been in since, without
counting the fact of her being there, without which no place is
beautiful to me. One of those six hours Sunday walks is about as much as
I can really enjoy fully the beauty of when my darling is not with me.
However darling I am cheerful & doing very well & was this morning when
I weighed 68 kilos being 3 lbs more Edition: current; Page: [267] than
Bordeaux, 5 than Torquay & 8 than London. I have got up to the highest I
weighed in the summer excursion—all but a pound, the weight of the thick
waistcoat. A propos that waistcoat has worthily justified its own
existence—I have done many things that I could not have done but for the
complete protection it gave to my chest. I found on getting her[e] (what
I did not expect) that a steamer starts for Genoa tomorrow—so as I do
not expect any more letters here, I have arranged everything for going
by it. I am sorry to say it takes 24 hours & starts in the morning
instead of evening so my only hope for escaping sickness consists in the
calm weather which after so much wind is now delightful. The days have
continued splendid till this morning which was partially cloudy but
entirely cleared off towards afternoon. I have come to the Empereurs
because she went there—it is full of English—there were several English
officers in uniform at the table d’hôte—young men one very handsome &
all I should think very silly. Vaucluse is not like my expectations
except in those broad features that one cannot be mistaken in. Of course
a shew place is always prosaic, but instead of the villas which would
recommend it in England there is one of the ugly villages which look
like the worst part of the towns. Happily just above the village the
ravine takes a turn & there is a quarter of a mile tolerably clear but
there is nothing like seclusion as at the Pont du Gard. The source is at
the foot of a mountain apparently nearly the height of Snowdon, but with
scarcely a particle of green on it & knocked about in ledges & pillars &
other fantastic shapes & the water comes out, if it can be called coming
out, at the back of a precipice which reaches nearly the whole height of
the mountain. Here in a nook where the narrow rocky gorge suddenly ends,
is a pool about the size of a small pond on a common, but out of this
rushes a mountain river as large as the Adour at Bagnères & immediately
tumbles over a series of enormous blocks of rock for about the height of
the Swallow fall,2 with the most splendid noise & foam, after which in
the next furlong the water gushes out from at least 100 places in the
mountain & swells the stream till from its size & rapidity if it were in
England it would rank as one of our notable rivers. A thing I have not
seen mentioned, I think, in any description is that in the quiet pool
above the fall you constantly hear a deep hollow roaring as if there was
a great commotion of waters in the heart of the precipitous mountain—&
possibly there is, though more probably it is the effect of the loud
noise of the fall—reverberated from every part of the amphitheatre of
immensely high rocks which surrounds. Altogether it was very fine,
especially the water & one had to ignore the Café Pétrarque, the Hotel
Pétrarque et de Laure &c all of which happily were out of sight. It is
27 kilometres from Avignon & a cabriolet cost 12 francs. The bill for
the two days at Avignon including servants Edition: current; Page: [268]
was 21½ francs, about 8s.6d a day. The whole cost of this three weeks
journey is just about £20, from Boulogne, or counting from London £23:
rather different from the summer journey which cost less than £31 for
nearly seven weeks—but there has been much more railway & a greater
distance travelled besides tables d’hôte at 3½ fr. instead of 2 f. & 2½,
& bedrooms 2 f. instead of 1. so that I have done pretty well. I hope
darling to find another sweet letter at Genoa. Ah dearest I wish I could
tell her all my dreams—last night I had such a sweet dream—dear one had
come & was going the rest of the way with me. She sees I have taken just
about the time we thought in getting from England here. My beauty will
get this letter pretty quick especially as I shall put it in the post
tonight for there are two mails in the 24 hours from here. How much
pleasanter railway travelling is in these countries than any other. It
seems to suit every country better than England—it cuts up beauties of
detail but suits the scale of the objects here which are large & far
apart. In all the towns here the railway with its long lines of arches
is a really fine feature in the view. Addio con tutti i baci
possibili—ah dearest how I do love you.

I write my angel before having received her letter if letter there be,
for it has not arrived yet as it was impossible it should—& by
calculation it seems hardly possible that it could arrive today or
tonight so that it was a mistake asking her to write here, but I was so
very anxious to hear without those very long intervals that I took the
chance & I dare say the post office here will redirect to Pisa. I had a
horrible passage—the boat did not get off till half past one though it
required everybody to go on board at eleven—& it arrived here about half
past one yesterday—at first I did pretty well, remaining on deck in the
beautiful afternoon & evening & passing that fine coast on which I could
quite distinguish Hyères, at least its exact position. We passed close
to the islands, but it was very rough even then whenever we were not
under the shelter of the heights a strong north wind having set in early
in the morning. After dark I was wretchedly sick & had hardly any sleep
for sickness & all day after arriving here I felt so ill & miserable
that I could go nowhere & do nothing. I am terrified at the idea that
all this must be gone through again for Sicily & again for Greece—it
seems as if Edition: current; Page: [269] nothing that they can give in
my solitary condition can be worth it. Today however I am well again &
have gone about in the most exquisite cloudless day, without the
slightest cold though there is snow on the low mountains just outside
the town on the side next Chiavari. I am quite reconciled to Genoa which
looked so dismal in the abominable weather we had last year that my
impression of it was very disagreeable, but in this glorious weather it
looks splendid. I am at the Quattro Nazioni, where the people are very
attentive & I am very comfortable though it does not seem to be very
thriving. It appears that the only way here to have a bedroom with a
fireplace is to take a sitting room with it or to pay the same as if you
did. I have therefore a large cheerful sitting room au 3me with a
bedroom opening from it for which I pay three francs. By the bye the
Hotel des Empereurs was about the dearest inn I ever was in, in France:
3 fr. for the sort of bedroom which is 2 fr. everywhere else: table
d’hote 4 fr. & other things in proportion. There is a beautiful
promenade here planted with trees & a garden looking splendidly over the
eastern part of the town & the mountains adjoining it—made, as an
inscription shews since we were first here—& where do you think the
railway goes? Exactly in front of the hotels, between them & the terrace
wall, every train night & day passing close to your window—which cannot
be pleasant for those au premier I should think. I feel much more in
spirits again than I yesterday thought I should in the whole journey. I
have nearly arranged with a vetturino to go to Lucca in three days,
halting at Sestri & la Spezia, paying 40 francs which is more than I
like to pay but having tried several I do not think I shall be able to
do better. Among the disagreeables of that sea passage one is a bad cold
in my head which it has left—but I do not mind it, as these colds go off
without leaving any cough that lasts above a day or two. I see either
the French papers or Galignani sufficiently often to be tolerably au
courant but I seldom read those tiresome speeches even when I have an
opportunity. Why dear did you wish the Foreign Enlistment Bill to be
lost?2 It seems to have been a mistake because unpopular but no doubt
Lord Raglan wants more practised soldiers than they are able to send
him. I have not seen in the whole of my passage through France a single
indication great or small that the war is popular there. They talk of it
quite as they would of some foreign contest & generally I think do not
augur well of its success. Neither have I heard one word uttered in
favour of L. Napoleon. People say but little & I do not like to tempt
them to say much but they say quite enough to shew the most entire
hostility. I shall now take this to the post & perhaps see one or two of
the palaces. I seem much farther from my dear one than in France—any
place in France if it be ever so far off seems so much a Edition:
current; Page: [270] home to us. I do not get on well with the Italian
here not only from the badness of my Italian but of theirs, for it is a
horrible patois almost as unItalian as the Venetian but without its
softness. Adieu darling—love me always—a thousand dearest loves.

There was no letter by today’s post, darling, which came in about two. I
should wait here for one: only that I am not certain she will write
here. The post office promises to send it on to Pisa if it comes. I have
been on foot nearly all day & have commenced performing the first duty
of man when in Italy, that of seeing pictures. I have seen two of the
best palaces, the Brignole Sale & the Pallavicini, both full of fine
pictures, & also a church or two: there were plenty more to see, but too
many pictures the same day are more than do one any good—& at the best
this hurried seeing of picture galleries is a sort of feast of Tantalus.
If I could come each day to one, or even two or three of the finest
pictures I have seen today, & sit down before them until I got to feel
them really what a different thing it would be. As it is one only sees.
I dare say by the time I leave Italy I shall be able to give a tolerable
guess at the authorship of a picture, but perhaps I shall not have had
much enjoyment of them. I could not help seeing however what a gem
almost any one of these pictures would appear in any modern exhibition,
& what is much more in any private room—& again even the common unknown
pictures in the churches all shew how the great painters have created
certain types & a certain stile which makes even the commonest Italian
painting have a certain grandeur as well as grace in it—something which
is to Guercino2 & the Caracci3 what they are to Titian & Michael Angelo
& I see the same in the colossal statues in the churches. I have seen
also a great many of the finest Vandykes extant, for the great Genoese
families seem all to have had themselves painted by him—& a Rubens that
might almost be taken for a Raphael, it is so really beautiful. My
negociation with the vetturino is off for he has found other English &
they will not travel tomorrow because it is Sunday, & the next day is
fête (New Year) so he says he cannot go till Tuesday, and I have
bargained with another to take me to Spezia in two days & I shall
probably finish this letter there. Perhaps Edition: current; Page: [271]
it is as well so, for I may possibly stay there a day & go to Lerici or
Porto Venere. I wish dearest you could see this place in its beauty—I am
now quite charmed with it as I was the first time. This inn too is so
much better & the people pleasanter than where we were. A propos the
trains which pass the window are only the goods trains, which go to the
custom house for the convenience of loading there: I suppose it is the
great means of transporting foreign goods to Turin. I have been reading
a number of Italia e Popolo which has a vigorous attack on our friend
the Avenir of Nice for saying the Piedmontese ought not to hate the
French government.4 It is quite a pleasure to read any thing free spoken
again. I am strong & well today, to my almost surprise after the extreme
prostration of yesterday—but that no doubt was partly owing to having
eaten nothing for 36 hours.

Sestri. Dec. 31. The voiture plan is answering capitally & I am very
glad I did not go with those English people, for being with Italians
only I get on like a house on fire with my Italian. The vetturino had
managed to fill his vehicle with Italians of I know not exactly what
rank though certainly plus que modeste, who no doubt paid him very
little, for there is anything but prix fixe on these occasions—but none
of them were at all disagreeable & one pleasant man about 40 with whom I
got into conversation directly though he could speak nothing but Italian
& evidently was not an educated man but yet (what never happens in
England) spoke his own language clearly & correctly. I got on capitally
by referring often to the little dictionary & had the satisfaction of
giving him a breakfast or rather dinner which he would not have had
otherwise. A propos of the dictionary when I teazed Lily for it I did
not know it was the nice copy with her (my darling’s) name in it. I
thought it was a similar one that I had formerly & which I would much
rather have taken for such hard wear than this, though it is sweet to
have this. The voiture travelling does excellently in all ways—one makes
use of the whole day, does not get into the night, & by utilizing hills
& the midday stoppage one gets nearly all the good of a walking
tour—today besides a very long hill I walked from the stopping place,
Rapallo, nearly to Chiavari before I was overtaken. It quite agrees with
my recollections that this eastern Riviera is finer than the western:
there is more variety in the farms, there is not the interruption by
those plains & generally instead of going round the promontories, one
crosses them, which makes more variety: what it does resemble is the
last bit from Mentone to Nice, & it is Edition: current; Page: [272] not
at all finer than that. Indeed that mountain of La Turbia with its
appendages of Montalbano, Villafranca, St Jean, St Hospice & Monaco
comprise in themselves all the beauty of which this kind of scenery
seems susceptible & whoever has seen them thoroughly has seen the whole
Riviera, & I am much inclined to think, all that is really
characteristic in the scenery of Italy & Sicily altogether. Consequently
I should have been more excited by this if we had not been at Nice so
lately5—nevertheless I enjoyed it much, having the most perfect weather
yesterday & today while the sun was up not a moment of cold though many
of heat & this although the people here talk of the weather as cold—what
must it be usually on the last day of the year! & the foliage here is
just the same in winter as in summer. I saw shortly before sunset an
effect of light which I never imagined possible & should have declared
impossible I am afraid if I had seen it in a picture. The bay being very
calm & merely just rippled, the reflexion from the nearly horizontal sun
was projected not in the ordinary way but in a broad pillar of light as
well defined as a river or a great road, of the exact breadth of the
disk of the horizontal sun, extending in a perfect straight line or
avenue beginning at the horizon & ending at the shore & too dazzling in
every part to be looked at for more than a moment. In nearly the whole
distance whenever one turned back one saw the line of the other Riviera
backed by high snowy mountains, extending full half way to Nice (one man
said quite into France) & looking quite close. There is here at Sestri a
first rate inn but I think it will prove very dear. The only dear thing
in the bill at Genoa was the firewood, in excuse for which the man said
that wood is always dear there & is brought from Cività Vecchia. I
should rather suppose it is brought from Tuscany (though perhaps the
Tuscans want all their wood themselves) or perhaps from Corsica, the
préfet of which I see advertises his coupe de bois by affiches in the
streets of Genoa. There is great complaint of the distress of the people
here—my fellow traveller said everything had failed except olives—not
only the vines but all grain & that the propriétaires are dying of
hunger. A propos I have been reading of a great & rapidly extending
disease among silkworms, propagated by the eggs—it seems as if there was
a conspiracy among the powers of nature to thwart human industry—if it
once reaches the real necessaries of life the human race may starve. The
potato disease was a specimen & that was but one root: if it should
reach corn? I think that should be a signal for the universal &
simultaneous suicide of the whole human race, suggested by Novalis.6
What a number of sensible things are not done, faute de s’entendre! In
the meantime let us make what we can of what human life we have got,
which I am hardly doing by being Edition: current; Page: [273] away from
you. I think I should feel the whole thing worthier if I were writing
something—but I cannot make up my mind what to write. Nothing that is
not large will meet the circumstances. I have finished Aminta & am
toiling through the Gerusalemme but this evening for a change I added a
canto of Dante—what a difference! now I said, I am beginning to enjoy—I
shall take the occasion of reading Dante through though I have no
helps—luckily I read Sismondi over again last winter.7 This Genoa is
full of remembrances of those 16 volumes & by the bye was the most
turbulent, the worst governed & the least respectable of all those
republics, the frantic personal animosities of the factions of nobles
not only filling the place with perpetual bloodshed but making one or
the other party continually put the place under a foreign despot, either
France, Austria or Spain. There is no city in Italy except Naples for
whose antecedents I have so little respect—but still the occasional
freedom & constant demand for energy made them vigorous & successful
both in war & in commerce: it is curious now to think for how long a
period they were masters of Galata in Constantinople, & Caffa in the
Crimea. I ramble on darling because it is the only way of talking to
her. I shall not however close this letter tonight. I do not find any
plants now—the few I found in France were all of them last roses of
summer, not first ones of spring—but the hellebore is beginning to come
out to my great delectation. I brought a botanical relic or two from
Vaucluse & have tried to read a little of Petrarch but it will not do— i
begl’occhi of Laura m’ennuient. I must give her a specimen of my fellow
traveller—he was remonstrating with another for jumping out of the
carriage & falling down & after some other things he added E tanto più
facile di farsi male che di farsi bene.8 It reminded me of “toute chose
a ses inconvéniens”. Now darling I must go to bed for my fire is going
out.

Spezia 1st January. Every possible good that the new year can possibly
bring to the only person living who is worthy to live, & may she have
the happiest & the maniest New Years that the inexorable powers allow to
any of us poor living creatures. I have been travelling again from eight
to seven—all the first part to Borghetto was among what seemed the tops
of mountains exactly like those which we saw from the back of the house
at Nice but twenty times as many of them—sometimes quite inland,
sometimes seeing the sea or the fine coast far below—coming often to
snow which was lying in all the places where it had drifted, & which a
week ago, it seems, made this road impassable even to the post. In one
fine descent there Edition: current; Page: [274] was visible in front a
long high range of completely snowy mountains, like the Alps or
Pyrenees, being the Apennines, near Pontremoli I suppose. From Borghetto
I walked on for more than five hours & was in the very town of Spezia
before the carriage overtook me, though I had walked up several great
heights before. I saw by a rather dim moonlight that magnificent first
view of the Gulf of Spezia & walked down the winding descent of the
mountain to it through the olive groves. The inn seems a very good one &
the rooms only Genoa price—Sestri was a franc more & I think I shall
stay here tomorrow especially as this vetturino though very eager to
take me on to Lucca or Pisa cannot be talked into doing it for less than
35 francs. Here is one of the conveniences of a companion. Though as you
see by my walking I am strong enough, my digestion is far from good &
has not been so in this journey. I do not think it is the diet, because
I digested perfectly in the last journey & did not digest well at
Torquay. I am afraid the unlucky truth is that I cannot digest without
cod liver oil & that none but Allen’s agrees with me. Certainly the only
week of decent digestion I have had this December was when I was
drinking one of the bottles of that—I have to save it, been drinking
some since, bought at Avignon, but it does me no good, no more than the
two kinds I tried at Torquay. I have begun one of the three remaining
ones today & if I really thought I should see Pope, I certainly should
ask him to bring some more out with him.9 Meanwhile the case is coming
to pieces—it was not strong enough for so much jolting & tossing by sea
& land. The Italian has gone on glibly today & my progress surprises me.
There was among others a jovial young Franciscan who I am sure is no
hypocrite: you should have heard his merry laugh at my suggestion that
the electric telegraph would formerly have been thought un’ opra del
diavolo—Nothing like cold even in the mountains till after dark & not
much then. To shew you the care I am taking of my diet, I eat only some
soup at Borghetto, & here at night a roast chicken (what a small one!)
with boiled potatoes & no bread & no tea. I shall take to simple hot
milk in the mornings, because with that bread is not necessary, & I
shall try what bitters & quinine will do again. Here is a long letter my
beloved & it does not end quite so satisfactorily as the beginning but
there is no help. I am very sleepy from so much walking & must go to
bed. The Franciscan was a most ignorant fellow—he guessed the mountains
towards Nice to be those of Corsica. These last we ought to have seen
but could not as the day was less clear than the last three or four
though still very fine. There is a beautiful spring heath just beginning
to come into flower which will make the wilderness blossom like the
rose. Good night my dearest dearest love—I kiss her mentally with my
whole heart. The mysterious looking paper I inclose this in will do as
well as anything else for a cover.

Another day such as one comes to Italy for—a perfect climate, & beauty
which wants nothing but the dearest eyes in the world to see it. This
gulf I think is very nearly the most beautiful place I ever saw. I do
not wonder that Shelley came to it.2 A propos I met a boatman who told
me he had served Shelley: when I asked him to point out Lerici, he first
said that Byron had lived there three months & that he had served him,
then mentioned “altro celebre Inglese, il signor Shellì, ch’ha perduto
la vita.” If he did serve Shelley he must have been a mere boy at the
time. It was not in the gulf itself that the catastrophe happened. The
gulf they say here is always as it was today, quite smooth—it had less
ripple than the lake of Como which it somewhat resembles but is only
about half the length & near double the breadth (as I guess). The neat,
really pretty & pleasant town stands in a very small vega3 entirely shut
in by mountains & cannot feel any wind but the south: between it and the
gulf is an open garden & a promenade road planted with trees from which
on the eastern side of the gulf unfold before you three ranges, the
first only hills though (like all here) of the forms of mountains, a
range of dark mountains behind, & beyond that a lofty range of snowy
mountains of the sharpest & peakedest sort of which the part which can
be seen from the town is equal to any part of the Pyrenees or Alps that
I remember: the highest part, a magnificent peaked ridge, is called
Monte di San Pellegrino. I should delight to have this view from our
window. Perhaps Spezia would be too hot in summer to live in, but the
right place would be somewhere on the east [west written above east]4 of
the gulf, which has this especial view & only the morning sun while we
should see the sun in the afternoon on the mountains opposite. Lerici is
on the wrong side; Porto Venere on the right, in both senses. I staid at
the excellent inn till 11 to rest myself, then sauntered out on the
Porto Venere road, going round the seven beautiful coves, of the form of
harbours, which succeed one another & five of which are said to be deep
Edition: current; Page: [276] enough for ships of war: Napoleon intended
to make this the great military port of his empire; I am very glad he
did not. In going round these lesser gulfs almost every view of the
mountains & coast that is possible presented itself & at the end is a
strait separating the promontory from a high rocky & woody island
(merely the end of the promontory cut off). At one end of this strait
towards the outer sea (about 8 miles from Spezia) is Porto Venere a
little old town with immensely high dark ugly houses rising from the
very sea itself—with a fine church however in a high position & another
ruined church in the exact corner point commanding they say the whole
coast to France, but today there was a complete fog out at sea though
inland & in the gulf it was beautifully clear. The town is squalid & the
houses speak of former riches & present poverty—the people are now all
fishermen & the women & children look unhealthy. I often observe this in
the healthiest situations when the towns have that horrid look. Spezia
on the contrary is bright, clean & cheerful with dignity. I had been so
often offered a carriage in the tiniest places yesterday, that I thought
I should have found one here to go back with, but I could find only
boats & the sea & strait were so rough (though the gulf was quiet) that
I could not venture it but made the boat go to the nearest village in
the gulf some distance off & joined it there. This made the walk
decidedly too much after the much walking of yesterday & it taxed my
strength but it does not seem to have done me any harm & I am
considerably better today by having taken myself in hand by diet &
medicine. The climate at present is divine: one never for an instant
thinks of cold, except near daybreak or dusk. The nice rooms too
everywhere are a pleasure: all the inns on the great roads of Italy are
got up for the English who do this good at any rate that there are such
inns at all the stopping places as one only looks for in at least a
provincial capital. The name of the inn translated into English
generally hangs out, thus Cross Malte Hotel. } I copy exactly one I saw
yesterday: the French name is generally written along the front of the
house, & the Italian not at all. My voiturin has at last consented to
take me to Lucca for 25 fr. if he finds anyone else & for 30 fr. if he
does not but that is much more than enough: however I have agreed to it.
I think I shall go to the “Grand Hotel Universe” (as it calls itself in
an advertisement). Lucca is only half an hour of railway from Pisa so if
I stay more than a night at Lucca I shall run over & get my letters.
Spezia is a sea bathing place & the baths form a part of the handsome
pile of buildings composing this inn which from the sea looks like the
Hotel de Ville at least. All up these mountains wherever there are olive
grounds there are also houses & here & there on a projecting rock, a
church or a village. As there is so much wildness & grandeur in other
parts of the view this is pleasant.

Edition: current; Page: [277]
Pisa, Jan. 4. Here I am in the old town, the old inn & I really think in
the old room. It feels very strange. As soon as I had installed myself I
rushed to the post office & what was my disappointment to find it just
shut (at ½ past 2) not to open again till 5. You may be sure I was
punctual & I got her dear letters of the 25th & 28th both marked 5, but
not that of the 27th on the Popish affair5 so I went again & the much
enduring much bewildered man promised that he would have a thorough
search by tomorrow morning. My comfort is that the letter of the 28th
having the postmark of today (if I read it rightly) that of the 27th if
sent to Genoa could hardly have been sent on so as to arrive today. How
sweet & precious her letters are. I am so glad she thinks so well of
Torquay, it is exactly what I should expect from what I saw of the
place. The nuisance of England is the English: on every other account I
would rather live in England passing a winter now & then abroad than
live altogether anywhere else. The effect of the beauty here on me,
great as it is, makes me like the beauty of English country more than I
ever did before. There is such a profusion of beauty of detail in
English country when it is beautiful, & such a deficiency of it here &
on the Continent generally & I am convinced that a week’s summer tour
about Dartmoor would give me as much pleasure as a week about Spezia.
There is not much to tell about the journey these last two days. The
weather has been somewhat less pleasant, a good deal of frost both
nights, & clouds with occasional sunshine in the day: this evening the
sky is bright but the mountains seen from here are shrouded with clouds.
The road wound through the first range of hills I saw from Spezia, into
the valley of the Magra, a broad straight valley most of it stony &
barren from inundations, this we forded at the height of the wheels &
reached Sarzana the last Sardinian town. From this till near Lucca the
road was level, along the edge of a plain, having on the left the snowy
range I mentioned before, & when we had passed that, other less grand
often woody mountains. The regular road was through Carrara but there
have been troubles there & the place is en état de siège & it was
thought there would be delays & hindrances from the police so I
consented to the vetturino’s proposal to go by a bye road avoiding
Carrara: it was very likely humbug of the fellow who is a great cheat &
a most impudent rascal (not insolent, which is the way of these people).
I had to make a scene & call him a liar publicly to which he gave me
ample provocation. He pretended too that he would not go through Massa
for the same reason, but he did, & there was no obstruction. I slept at
Pietra Santa where also is an excellent but dear inn: however I got off
part of the charge. The road today was through the finest olive grounds,
but sometimes had on the right a Maremma in great part overflowed which
I was told was ricefields. We Edition: current; Page: [278] crossed one
of the ranges of hills & arrived at Lucca but I did not stay to see
anything—it is so easily seen from this place. I came on by the first
train & shall probably stay here some days, the more so as I have been
quite poorly these two days. Why my digestion has broken down so
suddenly I cannot conceive & when it was so excellent before. That was
the last thing I expected to happen on this journey. It has not been
good from the first barring London, but the increase of weight up to
Avignon shews that nothing was seriously amiss. I think that odious sea
has done it: but when my breakfast today was two cups of hot milk & even
that acidified in my stomach & my dinner was two wings & a leg of a
small fowl & two potatoes without bread or anything else whatever & even
that acidified & when besides I have the nameless sensations proceeding
from indigestion in a later stage of the process it is quite time to
look to it especially as this is doing me harm otherwise. The (very
slight) night perspirations I had for a short time in spring have come
back these two nights & I have suddenly a pain in my left shoulder which
troubles me at no other time but makes it impossible to lie on that
side, which as it is the side I chiefly lie on, takes away a great deal
of my sleep. I have lost strength too but not more than one always does
from indigestion. I am thinking of consulting one of the English
physicians here. I shall stay here till I feel really well & shall
probably not go to Florence at all as there will be no letters there & I
cannot bear to be so long without them—besides I begin to be very
doubtful of getting to Greece at all, if even to Sicily & if so there
will be ample time for Florence in spring. It is a great bore that
letters take a week coming from Torquay here & of course two days longer
to Rome. I shall be very comfortable in this room for which I am to pay
4 pauls, little more than 2 francs though it is au premier. It seemed
strange to come from the immensely high stone houses of Genoa & the
Riviera to a town of stuccoed houses of no great height. The climate
seems quite different from the Riviera—there is a moister look about the
air in spite of its clearness. I have been to the Duomo—the grassy
piazza that looked so pleasant looks now as if a fair had just been held
on it. The cathedral itself seems to me less fine outwardly & finer
within than I thought—though all the arches are round & the columns
Greek & the ornamented ceiling modern Italian it has almost a Gothic
effect. There are also many fine pictures especially five or six of
Andrea del Sarto6 whom I think quite next to Raphael. As they are in a
church I can go again & enjoy them. The Baptistery is shut up for
repairs: which I regret as I wished to go into it in remembrance of the
day we saw the bambino baptized there. I never saw so many beggars as
here & they are such wretched objects one wishes to give to them all—it
is quite impossible to see anything in peace for them. Some however are
exactly like the figures of the same kind of people in the pictures. One
hears much of Edition: current; Page: [279] Italian pictures & little of
Italian sculptures except M. Angelo’s but I see everywhere statues in
the churches which seem to me as fine in pose & features & finer in
expression than the Greek—in the cathedral at Sarzana there are some
apostles really glorious. This town has to my eye a very deserted look,
much more so than as I remember it—it is said that the political
jealousies & fears of the Grand Duke which have made him take away the
Law Faculty from the University and remove it to Siena,7 have done harm
to the place. I really think I am better this evening unless it is
writing to my darling that makes me feel so. As the post goes out late I
shall not lose any time by keeping this letter open till tomorrow when I
can give her the latest account of how I am. You must take all my
impressions of the places cum grano, for I am conscious of seeing
everything on its worst side & I feel that I cannot do any justice to
what the places would be to me if I were there in a home & with the one
who constitutes home. You will be quite safe in writing to Rome on the
13th: how much later I shall be able to say in my next letter.

Jan. 5. No return of perspiration last night my beloved one & the pain
in the shoulder sufficiently diminished to enable me to lie sometimes on
the left side. The pain extends now all down the left side of the back &
I should think is only rheumatic. I do not feel much the matter with me
today except weakness & if I continue as well all day I shall take one
of Clark’s alterative pills at night which I should think will quite
bring me round. I shall not go out much today. Luckily the day is not
very tempting—it began half foggy like a fine day in the heart of London
& is now very cloudy. I have got some French novels to fill up the time
with. The letter is not forthcoming at the post yet: if it went to Genoa
it will probably arrive this afternoon. How unlucky that I said anything
about writing to Genoa. I still feel inclined to get on to Rome without
going to Florence but I feel all my plans rendered uncertain by the bad
effect the sea appears to have on me. I will write very soon without
waiting to fill a long letter as I know she will be anxious. What a
comfort that her health gives me no new cause of anxiety: I shall have
to take care not to walk too much, which has not been necessary before.
The walking to & at Spezia would have been nothing remarkable when I was
at Blackheath or even at Montpellier but it is evident I was exhausted &
not fit for a long walk & after the long walk I was not fit for even the
moderate walk to Porto Venere—but she may depend on me for taking care
in future. I have had a severe lesson—adieu darling of my soul—

I am still here darling, wandering about the town for I am not yet
strong enough to take a long country walk & the short ones here are good
for nothing. Before I leave I shall walk through the Cascine2 to the
sea, & go to Lucca. I feel very much put out about my plans. It is
pretty clear that I shall recover from this attack under my own
treatment without going to a doctor, but it is discouraging to find that
there is so much difficulty in what never before had any, viz. keeping
myself in a condition to digest. The Popish letter3 has not yet made its
appearance. This place is pleasant more from recollections than anything
in itself. Today began as dull as any day in England; then the sun came
out & it is now warm, & like a fine early day in English spring.
Whatever people may say, Tuscany is not Italy. I have seen nearly
everything there is to see here. Today being a fête I heard the end of
the service at the Cathedral: the organ was beautifully played & the
music beautiful: but no singing, only the usual groaning noise in the
intervals of the organ. The cathedral is the only building which grows
on me. The Baptistery & the leaning tower seem to me child’s toys but I
now admire the cathedral without as well as within. Lily would have
liked to hear that service, looking into the choir with its gallery
above gallery, staircase above staircase like Piranesi,4 & every part
(which is not painted in fresco) fine marble or gilding—besides a
gigantic Christ in mosaic covering the circular roof of the apsis. You,
I think, would have felt with me here where the priests are powerful,
preponderance of detestation of the whole thing. I must say too that now
when things are no longer all delightful merely because Italian, I feel
sickened by the perpetual inscriptions in honor of those Medicean grand
dukes, who like all the Italian princes for the last three centuries
were as worthless vermin as ever crawled on the face of the earth. I
could look with some pleasure on the statue of Peter Leopold5 “forty
years after his death”—he was a philosopher like his brother Joseph 2d &
was the greatest reformer & Edition: current; Page: [281] legislator
that modern Europe had yet had, but even he, having become emperor of
Austria, began the war against the French Revolution & died soon after
exhausted by sensual excesses. This is a splendid place for the very
oldest church paintings—besides the almost effaced frescoes of the Campo
Santo, the Academy of Fine Arts is full of them, many, indeed most, very
fine in their way, & with much more ease & grace of execution than is
commonly said. But they have only one kind of expression. As the ideal
of those painters was exactly that of a Hindu or Buddhist ascetic,
entire absorption in thoughts of another world, these are not like
living creatures, & if one met them one could take them for nothing but
somnambulists. I think I see now in what the great merit of Giotto
consisted. His figures are alive & look as if they had relation to this
world. The others have generally even their eyes turned inward, or if
they now & then seem to be looking at something it is languidly as if
they were in haste to get back to their dream. If Giotto was the first
of the modern painters who reinvented life, he deserves all his
reputation. Perhaps however it was Cimabue.6 There is a Cimabue here but
it seems much below Giotto of whom there are multitudes (perhaps many of
them by his pupils)—the stile of Giotto is quite that of the modern
painters. The thing which has given me most pleasure of all I have seen
here is that the Government has not ventured to efface all the
remembrances of 1848.7 There is still in the Campo Santo the monument
with the names of those who died for Italy in that campaign—also the
chains taken by the Genoese from the Pisans in a naval victory & given
to the Florentines who kept them attached I think to the Cathedral were
given back to Pisa by the Florentines as an act of fraternity in 18488 &
were put up in the Campo Santo with an inscription containing their
whole history which still stands. Perhaps the Govt is not afraid of them
because like all other inscriptions here they are in Latin. But it is
plain that nothing but foreign force supports this government. Even the
custode of the Campo Santo and the wife of the custode of the Academy
who shewed me a splendid group of sculpture executed ten years ago by a
brother of Guerrazzi,9 were both of them quite evidently as strong
friends of the cause as they dared to shew.

I have been to the post office since the post came in—it has not brought
the missing letter.10 I have written to Genoa about it, but as it would
not do to delay writing to Pope any longer at the risk of his not
receiving the letter Edition: current; Page: [282] before the time when
he proposed going (the middle of January), six days at least being
required before it will reach him, I have written recommending Nice—&
saying about myself that the sea has made me so unwell as to make all my
beyond sea projects uncertain but that a letter will find me at Naples &
that when I know where to direct to him I shall be happy to let him know
my further plans. It is a bore having to write without receiving your
letter but luckily you mentioned Nice in that of the 28th & I think mine
to him is quite safe. I shall send this by the same post that my beloved
one may know I am getting better—I hope I shall be sufficiently well &
strong tomorrow to go to Lucca & see the town, the churches & pictures
there. A propos the railway carriages are of the nasty American kind
with a passage down the middle going through all the carriages (of the
same class, that is). At least the 2d & 3d classes are so—I did not see
the first. The 2d class is cheap enough—two pauls—less than a shilling.
& now good night my dearest darling angel.

I see Galignani pretty often—surely the mismanagement at Sebastopol11
must be very gross though the Times says so.

My dearest angel, I have got rid of my sensations of acidity & of nearly
all the other sensations of indigestion—& have no feelings of illness
left except those slight ones which always accompany the sort of
weakness which still remains. Though my tongue is not yet right, the
pain in my shoulder is gone, but I do not recover strength, & I do not
get rid of the night perspirations. They are not alarming—there is not
enough of them to be a cause of weakness & I am convinced they are only
an effect of it being accompanied as they were last spring with a
certain facility of being put in a perspiration in the daytime. I cannot
understand why I do not recover my strength as I am now able to digest
my usual breakfast of eggs tea & toast, & a small dinner of roast meat
or chicken & potatoes only. But it is much easier to lose strength than
to recover it when one has my disease. Today I resolved to try if I
could shake off the weakness & I therefore went to Lucca. (I should have
gone yesterday but the Sunday trains did not suit for coming back. The
Sundays Edition: current; Page: [283] & fêtes seem much observed here as
to work, though not I dare say as to play.) All I did at Lucca did not
amount to an hour’s strong walking but it was of course more in reality
as it was partly seeing churches &c. I do not think I am the worse for
it, but I felt fatigued all through, walked very slow & had to
constantly sit down. We shall see if I have perspiration again tonight:
if not, I shall leave tomorrow for Siena on the way to Rome: if yes I
shall leave, but for Florence, & see Clark’s man, Dr Wilson,2 as he may
not think it prudent for me to go so long a journey just yet. You see
darling I tell you everything at the risk of making you uncomfortable
but you will have the more confidence in what I tell, & it is doing as I
would be done by, for it is what I wish you to do to me—I am afraid you
do not always. Lucca is a quiet dull town, now no longer a residenz & I
dare say a very cheap place to live in, as well as convenient, being
close to Pisa, Leghorn & Florence by railway, & its Bagni (two or three
hours off) the best summer residence in Italy. It is of brick & stucco
surrounded by a red brick wall, on the top of which all round is a fine
broad carriage road, planted with a double avenue & the bastions at the
angles are lawns planted with groves. The view from every part of this
road is beautiful: on one side the town with its many high svelte square
church towers, marbled & columned, on the other the panorama of
mountains which surrounds the town on all sides, leaving only a very
small opening towards Pisa & a rather larger towards Florence. These
mountains are at a considerable distance from the town & begin by olive
covered hills mounting gradually on one (the north) side to many
summits. The cathedral is one of the finest in Italy. The immense height
gives these basilicas internally the effect of Gothic, but in this all
above the lowest line of arches of the nave is Gothic & of the highest &
gracefullest sort. In this & some of the other churches there are some
beautiful pictures, which gave me more pleasure than any I have seen in
this journey except the Andreas at Pisa.3 The best are by Fra
Bartolomeo,4 Ghirlandajo5 & Daniele da Volterra.6 I much prefer seeing
pictures in churches to the way one sees them in the private
galleries—malgré the presence & jabber of a custode whom I generally
take the first time of going, & was obliged to take at Lucca where they
have the odious way of keeping all their celebrated pictures covered up.
The custode of the Duomo at Lucca was quite a model of the genre by his
Edition: current; Page: [284] senility, (he was a regular Pantaloon) his
garrulity, superstition, & intense respect for all the powers that be.
Il m’en coûte not to go to Florence where there is such an enormous mass
of pictures & sculptures, but I shall not if I can help it. In any case
darling you can write to Rome as late as the 16th & I shall wait there
long enough to receive it. There is no use in stopping longer here
though I like the place & am in the pleasantest situation in it. I
notice a curious thing here—a list hung up of the persons who have
obtained exemption from paying the visits of ceremony customary at the
new year—this exemption is obtained by paying a florin (2½ pauls about
14 pence) to a certain charitable institution. This seems to me a very
droll practice, of paying a commutation in money for an obligation of
politeness & it shews how irrational a thing opinion is, when it
continues to impose formalities which it proves itself to consider
utterly unmeaning & inept. I wonder if this bizarrerie could have grown
up anywhere but in a catholic country where sins are tariffed at so
much, & prayers, penances & masses at so much & an account current kept
open with heaven. There is a convent here which is exactly a piece cut
out of the Alhambra. As for the climate, it is most satisfactory as to
mildness. They call the weather cold at present, & a bit of the city
moat which still remains (on the north side of the town & therefore
under the shade of the wall) was not only frozen over this morning but
much of the ice still remained this evening at sunset: but I had to
laugh at the idea of calling it cold. I never feel so. One needs a fire
in the house, but a little is enough. But as to clearness—I have had
here all weathers but rain—mostly sunshine & today cloudless, but never
so clear a day as any we had those ten days at Torquay. There has always
been much haze. I fancy Torquay would suit everybody whom this suits.
The fine days here do not seem finer than there but no doubt there are
many more of them: though according to Murray more rain falls at Pisa
than either at Leghorn, so near, or Florence, so much higher up in the
mountains. I was amused by two Italians in the railway chattering French
& English to one another. I suppose from the same motive as we talk
French at home.

I am in complete spirits my darling one—not only not uneasy but not the
least nervously depressed. There is nothing to regret but the loss of so
much time out of that which was to have produced improvement in health.
If it was to be it is better it should have been so near the beginning,
as there is plenty of time to make up for it. Addio mia divina—mia
adorata.

Mind she tells me whether she stays at Torquay beyond January. If not I
shall have in less than a fortnight to leave off directing my letters
there. Jan. 9. No perspiration last night darling & I hope I shall have
no more now. I shall be off for Siena today & keep Florence to console
me if I cannot get beyond sea. No news of the missing letter. Adieu. A
thousand loves.

My darling love, to begin with my health as what interests her most. I
have had no more return of perspirations & for the first time today my
stomach has felt something like the sensations of recovered health.
Encouraged by this I tried the experiment of eating a few grapes after
my modest dinner—the first grapes I have seen—there is not a grape at
Pisa & I fancied there were none in Italy. But the experiment
failed—they turned sour directly. You see in what a very delicate state
my stomach is—why, heaven knows, for I have done nothing to try it—&
that 24 hours seasickness should have so changed the whole condition of
the digestion is as strange as any other explanation one can give. I
have no doubt however that this acidity will be gone tomorrow, & my
strength also seems to be a little returning today—perhaps it will
return in time. One of my conjectures is that I have been having a
little softening of tubercle, as Ramadge thinks I have had before though
Clark thinks not—this would account for the sudden loss of strength & I
am inclined to the idea because of the increased quantity & worse
quality of the expectoration, which however is only as it has been
several times before. I think myself in full though slow convalescence &
I must endeavour not to get unwell again. I abused the Lucca railway,
but what shall I say of the Leghorn & Florence? The seats are
lengthwise—the passengers have their backs to the country—& there is a
back to back seat down the middle—the unfortunate occupants of which are
the only ones who can possibly see out, by peeping between their
opposite neighbours if the blinds are not drawn as they mostly are,
since they are drawn when the sun shines & there is no motive to undraw
them when it does not. Luckily there are seats along the two ends as
well as sides & I got a place on one of them. I looked into the first
class carriages & saw the occupants in the same comfortable manner
seated round the carriage with a table in the midst. Odd that the
Italians care so little about their beautiful country. The Siena line
which is a branch turning off at Empoli (an hour short of Florence) has
carriages of the usual English & French sort. The railway soon passed by
the last mountains of the mountainous country which extends from here to
Nice & entered a richly cultivated plain, with few mountains in sight &
those distant & low. Nothing was visible but very clean looking crops of
green corn in regular beds like a garden ground, divided into squares by
rows of mulberry trees with vines festooning from one to another. The
country from Empoli to Siena I did not see, as it was dark, there being
only two trains, early morning Edition: current; Page: [286] & evening.
Siena quite agrees with my recollection of it as a cold looking gloomy
town—not at all cold though to the sensations—in spite of the very
narrow streets, very high houses & almost entire absence of places (one
excepted) or any other openings from which to see more of the sun than
illuminates the top story. It must be a delightful town in a burning
sultry summer. Though it is all hill I had gone nearly all over it
before I could get the least bit of view out of it. When I did, I found
that the backs of many of the houses must have a country view, as it
lies on the twisted chine of a ridge (chine not in the I. of Wight
sense) into which two deep ravines full of olive grounds run up from the
country. I then caught a fine view or two of the town—the country of
which only a little can ever be seen at once, seems not fine for
Italy—it is more like a French view & we should call it fine there. The
cathedral however is magnificent. I could not have supposed that round
arched buildings could give me so much of the same feeling that Gothic
ones do. But when there is the same immense height, & when the same
infinite quantity of details subordinate to one coup d’oeil which gives
such a feeling of vastness in the northern Gothic is reproduced in
another way by the infinite quantity of figures (painted or statues)
colouring gilding &c to which the alternate black & white of the marble
within & without contributes, one is (at least I am) surprised to find
how it affects one. The peculiarity of this cathedral is that it is
paved with sculpture—historical pictures being chiselled in the common
pavement & that under the dome being a peculiar kind of mosaic, of white
& brown marble & black composition. I had no idea that the effect of
this could be so fine & I expect I shall find the common pavement of
cathedrals tame after it. The one piazza is like that at Brussels &
there is an hotel de ville as large & still more moyen âge than that,
though not so beautiful, with a tower as high as I ever saw (much larger
at top than bottom) but all brick & looking entirely made for the
warlike uses of the times of the signorìa & not also for ornament like
those in Belgium. I can imagine that the tocsin heard from that must be
awful. I saw all the pictures of note said to be in the town viz at the
cathedral, the hotel de ville & the church of the Dominicans—there may
be private galleries but Mrs Starke,2 now my only help, does not mention
any of those I saw. Some are celebrated but there are none of such as
interest me—except that some in the cathedral shew the effect that may
be produced by great vast frescoes in a fine church. I have been plagued
out of my life with vetturini & I was near having to go to Florence. One
rascal broke his appointment but I have closed with another to take me
in 2½ days to Viterbo from where there is a diligence to Rome Edition:
current; Page: [287] in one day: this is to cost me 8 scudi: there are
four other travellers I suppose Italians all. My hopes of seeing Sicily
have a little revived by learning from Mrs Starke that even in her time
it was quite practicable to go to Reggio on the straits of Messina by
land—the road excellent, vetturini to be had, only the inns bad. I shall
enquire about it fully at Naples, & at present my feeling is that way or
not at all. Hitherto I have not known what a bad inn is in Italy. This
one is the least good I have been at & this would be a good one in
France. If I can get a companion of the right sort we may take a servant
with us who can buy & cook provisions & so it may do. Thank heaven it
will not now be so very long before I have another letter—I hope
several. I dare say I shall have time to write on the road. Adieu my
sweetest most precious beloved one.

My blessed angel I begin this now but I dare say I shall finish it at
Rome. It grieves me to think that every fresh letter is longer before it
reaches her—but when I get to Rome that will no longer be the case, for
the present. To continue the bulletin of my health—those grapes were a
most unfortunate incident. They brought back all the dyspeptic symptoms
which I hoped I had got rid of—not quite so bad as before, however,
except the tongue, which is worse. By extreme prudence in diet I am I
hope conquering the dyspepsia again, but I cannot hope to get rid of it
while travelling—the inevitable irregularity as to hours & the
difficulty of finding in these little places anything that I dare eat,
are great impediments. What I chiefly fear is that though I shall get
rid of this state of the digestion I shall remain subject to it—if so my
prospects every way are much impaired & I should now think it a great
thing if I could be sure of coming back in as good health & strength as
I was from August to November. But at Rome I shall have quiet, good
food, a good climate & good medical advice if I need it.—My darling sees
by the date that I have come a different road from our former one—by
Chiusi (Porsenna’s2 capital, now a small town on the borders of Tuscany)
Città dela Pieve (city of the parsonage house) where I slept last night
& Orvieto Edition: current; Page: [288] to join the other road at or
near Viterbo. I have had to do with a rascal of a voiturier—really the
impudent knavery of these fellows disgusts one with Italian travelling.
These troubles are much less unpleasant when we are together, because
(not only I have her help, but) the feeling of being bored & worried for
her takes away the bore & worry—but when it is for myself only it is a
real torment. This rascal signed a written engagement in the presence of
the inn people which I thought bound him to every essential point. But
unluckily I consented to a clause for paying the money in advance. The
consequence was that instead of a proper voiture, I was disposed of to a
series of four successive diligences, the rascal pocketing two thirds of
my eight scudi, the amount of which has astonished by its roguery each
successive office to which I had to go. Yet I beat the fellow down all I
could but he held firm, knowing I suppose that I was in his power.
Further, though he undertook in writing that I should be at Viterbo
tomorrow evening, I found on inquiring here that the diligence leaves in
the evening & arrives next morning, so that I am fain to pay two scudi
more for a carriage to myself to go in the daytime. The diligence from
Viterbo to Rome is a day diligence so I think I am sure to get to Rome
on the evening of the 14th & glad I shall be. I shall then too feel warm
again, for these two days have been real winter days, the first cold I
have felt since leaving England. They were, au reste, very beautiful
days. The country, the first day from Siena, was hilly, but only what we
should call fine country in France; until Chiusi, which is extremely
fine—a broad wide spreading valley (the Val di Chiana) (not like English
valleys) along the front of the hill (all these towns are on hills) &
beyond this is a magnificent mountain; the Monte della Pieja [sic], to
which we were approaching half the day—On the same side with Chiusi was
another valley & heights beyond it, more than hills yet not mountains,
on the top of which was Città della Pieve. Today the whole journey was
most beautiful through & over forestry rather than woody hills of great
height. Orvieto occupies the top of a hill precipitous on all sides with
perpendicular rock—tufo they call it & it seems so for it looks like
white strongly agglomerated sand. There is one of the finest cathedrals
I have seen—roundarched within, but pointed without, with a splendid
façade in which with the Gothic forms & even a rose window is combined
quantity of fine bas reliefs & all the rest very well painted in
fresco—the effect altogether is very fine. Within are the excellently
preserved frescoes of Luca Signorelli,3 said to have been much studied
by M. Angelo before painting his Last Judgment & indeed he has evidently
taken much of the conception from them—there are four of them on the
same subject. The others, Paradise, Hell, & Antichrist a false image of
Christ with the devil whispering in his ear & surrounded by great
folks—but the Edition: current; Page: [289] conception of this promised
more than it fulfilled. They are altogether the most like M. Angelo of
any I ever saw. There are some other frescoes of Beato Angelico4 in his
soft devout stile but they were on a ceiling & so high up that I could
not look at them comfortably. I walked about half round the front of the
rock on which the town stands, by a horse path on the side of the hill.
The situation is very fine, a deep valley all round, an exaggeration of
Nassau, the high surrounding hills covered with olives on the sunny
side, with oaks on the other & in summer it must be lovely—it was so to
the eye even now. The inn here & that of last night are merely decent
Italian inns, good of their sort but none of the comforts I found at all
the others, nevertheless last night I had the sweetest sleep I have had
for a long time, full of dreams of you & of happy being together & of
planning & doing things for the good of others. I was quite sorry to be
waked at three (it was four the night before) for the diligence. But
tomorrow I shall not leave till eight. I have a good sort of landlady
here who does everything I want & tries much to content me. But I remark
that every Italian I have to do with, rogue or honest, has the manner &
appearance & I have no doubt many of them the reality of good
nature—they all seem glad to do little kindnesses, & the manner of all
is courtesy itself. Today I have succeeded for the first time in getting
kid for dinner (N.B. not a good specimen) & have for the first time
boiled tea as we did at Hyères, a most pleasant feeling of similitude to
me just now. I had only entamé my tea once before, having found good tea
everywhere, save at Genoa where finding theirs bad I tried my own, but
it was bad too proving that the fault was in the water. At Pisa & all
the places on the road their tea was excellent & they made it
themselves, only too strong & enough for three people. The pope’s
doganiere at C. della Pieve was deaf to hints about money—how he did
peek about everything, with what immense curiosity—perfectly
civilly—ending by making me pay exactly the sum I shewed him before, viz
five pauls. I think my strength is coming back a little, but so very
gradually that I am not certain.

Viterbo, Jan. 13. I feel nearly well today my darling—even my tongue is
better. I have got onto the great road again, & therewith to a
comfortable inn, though I had not much reason to complain of the others.
I had a very enjoyable long night—these large Italian beds are so very
pleasant—full of dreams, none of them disagreeable, I remember one—I was
disputing about the ballot with Calhoun,5 the American, of whom in some
strange way I had become the brother—& when I said that the ballot was
no longer necessary, he answered “it will not be necessary in heaven,
but it will always be necessary on earth.” From Orvieto here much of the
way is extremely fine—the Edition: current; Page: [290] view of Orvieto
itself crowning its rock, seen from the ascent of one of the higher
hills which surround it is one of the finest things I have seen in
Italy. It looks the very type of Shelley’s “warrior peopled citadels.”6
The latter half of the way was an approach to a striking mountain,
somewhat resembling that of Radicofani & the driver had the impudence to
pretend it was that. The fact seems to be that they seldom know the
names of anything but towns, & if you ask about anything else you are
answered at random. Today we passed Montefiascone, the day before
yesterday Montepulciano which with Orvieto makes the three places which
are said to make the good wine, but I suppose they make little or none
now. I had a distant peep of the lake of Bolsena. Tomorrow I shall start
early either by the diligence or a voiture & I shall get to Rome by
nightfall, but I shall put this into the post here, as she will get it
two or three days sooner by my doing so. I shall write almost directly
from Rome. How I look forward to the letters there—they are the chief
cause of my not going to Florence. Adieu angel of my life—blessedest
love.

It was astonishing the quantity of country people I met going to market
at Orvieto. Today also I have seen a great number of people working in
the fields. Many of them wear pantaloons of goatskin with the hair on,
which gives them a Robinson Crusoe look. Most of the countrymen wear
cloaks which they throw over their shoulders, Spanish fashion. adieu
again—

Rome—Jan. 14. To my great disappointment the post at Viterbo was shut.
In other places I have been prepared for this contingency by obtaining
postage stamps, but here in a new country I am as yet unprovided with
them & if I had them should not have known how many to put. What is
worse the post office was closed here too when I arrived & I cannot get
my letters till tomorrow morning. I came here in a very comfortable but
slow diligence in a very fine day, but which would be called decidedly
hazy even in England. I have never had what we mean by a southern sky
since Spezia. This agrees with but exceeds my previous idea of the local
climates of Italy. Rome on entering by that striking Piazza del’ Popolo
looked prodigiously fine—more so than I expected. The long dusty road
from the Ponte Molle as well as the principal streets were crowded with
people walking & with carriages—it being Sunday evening—but I saw none
but Italians & the waiter at Franz’s says there are very few forestieri7
this season which he attributes to the cholera though it has been over
these two months—so much the less my chance of finding a companion. But
I have to get well first & I have not been very well today, but expect
to be so very soon by aid of rest & Dr Deakin.8 I have got Edition:
current; Page: [291] a comfortable room at Franz’s for 5 pauls, about 2½
francs which I think is as little as I can expect & I shall now for some
time return to regular habits. The idea of stopping some time in the
same place (& that place Rome) makes me feel excessively comfortable.
Though I am not in the mood of expecting much from anything away from
home, I do expect great pleasure from the statues & pictures here. I
have been running through Mrs Starke’s catalogue with delight & mean to
live in the galleries. The Campagna is not tempting at this season,
looking dead & brown. As yet nothing looks green except the young
corn—although it did not feel cold today there was ice in every shady
place. There is a proverb here—dopo Candelara, d’inverno siamo
fuora—after Candlemas (Feb. 2) winter is over—but it wants more than a
fortnight of Candlemas yet. The view at the approach to Rome was
splendid—some accidental rays of sunlight struck exactly in the right
places. All the streets are full of placards about the Immaculate
Conception which has just been for the first time declared an article of
faith.9 Decidedly this old carcase of the Papacy stirs about, & makes
believe to be alive. The first sign I saw of the French was near
Viterbo, a board with “Limites de la garrison”—but the French have all
left Viterbo now & only a few remain at Rome. It is very disagreeable
not to know with more certainty my future movements, so as to be able to
make sure of no loss or delay of any of those precious letters—but
unless my health hinders which is very improbable I shall stay here long
enough to receive the letters of the 16th (the last date I gave her) &
then go to Naples. So she had best write to Naples, darling, & continue
doing so till I am able to tell her whether I go on to Sicily or return
to Rome. I long more than I can express for tomorrow’s letters, it is so
long now since I have had any. I forgot to say that the perspirations
have quite gone: I did not welcome the coming but I sped the parting
guest. I fear the post for England only goes out three times a week so
that I shall never be able to send letters oftener—but I shall always
write then—adieu again life of my life. I shall make the same envelope
serve by sealing it.

This morning I had the happiness to find two of her letters at the post
office—one was unsealed (the seal was broken, but as if it had parted of
Edition: current; Page: [292] itself)—one the Pope letter2 sent from
Genoa to Pisa & faithfully forwarded from thence—the Genoa people having
attended to my letter from Pisa though they forgot their previous
promise. It was wrong of me to risk losing one of her precious
letters—but otherwise it is as well that I did not wait for this at
Genoa, as in that case I should have written directly to Pope giving him
the choice of Montpellier or Hyères, while as it is I write according to
her last & best advice. The other letter was her nice one of the 4th.
Italy as you say is much improved by whatever of the modern improvements
has reached here—it is a pleasure to see the electric telegraph even
here; it reaches from Rome to Bologna, but (characteristically) with
only one wire. I would wager much that the French made it be erected.
Rome is not at all changed & is a place like no other. One lives
entirely in the past. “Du haut de ces pyramides quarante siècles vous
regardent”3 was little to ‘it’, for there it was only the fortieth
century back, qui regardait, but here it is the whole succession of
intermediate centuries—all history seems to planer over one. There are
from that same Egyptian period the innumerable obelisks. I had quite
forgotten there were so many—they meet one every where with their
hieroglyphics—there is the vast population of Greek statues of all
periods, there are all the Roman remains & the whole middle age, down to
St Peter’s & most of the churches which represent the renaissance & the
Pope with what belongs to him is just another old ruin, of which being
more recent than the others it is natural that there should be a greater
quantity of remains: & those priests & monks & their mumbling services
are those more modern remains—still standing to wait till the next
comes—& that this is true & no illusion the siege in 1849 proves.4 In
the meanwhile the whole place is a historical museum with some
theatrical representation of history still going on. I have been to St
Peter’s, the apparent smallness of which from without astonishes me more
than ever—it is vastly inferior in effect externally to St Paul’s—but
what a difference internally! I enjoy it more than I ever did—enjoy is
the word—the more so as it is the only warm place I have been in today
except my room (& that I had to change because the first I had proved
very cold). St Peter’s is evidently warmed artificially. You have not
Edition: current; Page: [293] seen & felt Rome cold & looking cold.
Today is a bright, real winter day & the streets of Rome admit of hardly
any sun: only the Piazza of St Peter’s with its soldiers exercising was
bright, & how those two beautiful fountains did sparkle & make rainbows
in the sunshine. The promenade too of the Pincio was bright, & where
sheltered, tolerably warm. The Borghese garden, as seen from it, does
not seem the worse for wear. But the cold & the look of cold makes the
lookout on the Campagna disagreeable instead of pleasant. The town only
is pleasant, with its fine principal streets & its innumerable domes. I
went to the Vatican & began seeing the statues but it closes at three &
I was turned out—today was the public day, Monday, but it is open on
other days by a fee to the custode which I shall not grudge. I have read
up the Times at the old place, Monaldini’s. There is another place of
the same kind now, Piale’s, also in the Piazza di Spagna, which seems
more frequented, especially by English. The only thing I found
noticeable was the Queen’s letter5—was there ever such a chef d’œuvre of
feebleness—O those grandes dames how all vestige of the very conception
of strength or spirit has gone out of them. Every word was evidently her
own—the great baby! & it is not only the weakness but the décousu, the
incoherence of the phrases—sentences they are not. No wonder such people
are awed by the Times, which by the side of them looks like rude
strength.—Whom should I find here in the same inn but Lucas6—not a bad
rencontre to make at Rome. I left my card for him & shall no doubt see
him tomorrow. Au reste, nobody else here whom I know, judging from the
lists at the libraries. Hayward7 appears to have been here in autumn but
no doubt has left. There is a Lady Duff Gordon but I suppose & hope it
is the mother of the baronet.8 And there are a few people whom I have
just seen—Lady Langdale9—some of the Lyalls10—& Edition: current; Page:
[294] others whom I forget. If Naples is like Rome I have no chance of a
companion. I have found the address of Dr Deakin & shall call on him
tomorrow. I have been considerably better today but I think it best to
consult somebody about my stomach & my strength. I am anxious to get
back the last, since at present long walks which have done me so much
good hitherto, are impossible. I have not ventured to take quinine while
my stomach was at all disordered, which it is still, a little. I see a
great many English priests all about, as well as many other English. On
Thursday I believe there will be fine music at St Peter’s which I will
certainly hear.—There is so much to do & to see here, that it has taken
off my nascent velleity of writing. On my way here cogitating thereon I
came back to an idea we have talked about & thought that the best thing
to write & publish at present would be a volume on Liberty.11 So many
things might be brought into it & nothing seems to me more needed—it is
a growing need too, for opinion tends to encroach more & more on
liberty, & almost all the projects of social reformers in these days are
really liberticide—Comte,12 particularly so. I wish I had brought with
me here the paper on Liberty that I wrote for our volume of
Essays—perhaps my dearest will kindly read it through & tell me whether
it will do as the foundation of one part of the volume in question—If
she thinks so I will try to write & publish it in 1856 if my health
permits as I hope it will.

Jan. 16. I saw Dr Deakin this morning: he is a pleasant mannered man. He
thinks he can set me right by a dose of bluepill & that I should
afterwards take steel. I do not like taking mercury, as Ramadge thinks
it so bad in consumption—& it was partly foresight that mercury would be
recommended, which made me unwilling to consult any medical man if I
could help it—though I took one of Clark’s mercurial pills on my own
prescribing. I told Deakin my objection which he seemed to think just
against taking mercury as an alterative—to remain in the system, but
this he said was to purge me & be carried off. So I mean to take it. I
am certainly stronger today—I have walked about more than any day for
some time. I am getting quite familiar with the obscure part of the town
by my daily journeys to & about the post office, which is now removed to
a most inconveniently distant place, the Piazza Madama (so named from
Catherine de Medici)13 between the Pantheon & the Piazza Navona. It was
less cold today because less wind, though Edition: current; Page: [295]
the basins of most of the fountains had ice all round the edges over
which the water flows. How very pleasant is that multitude of fountains
everywhere—but indeed Rome is the city of multitude—multitude of
fountains, of obelisks, of domes, of statues. I went through the Museum,
catalogue in hand, today, & now knowing the whole, shall return often to
see those I most like. It gave me quite as much & more pleasure than I
expected. The celebrated Meleager14 I do not care a rush for—I should
never have guessed it to be ancient. The Apollo is fine but there is a
Mercury (formerly mistaken for an Antinous) which seems to me finer & a
gigantic sitting Jupiter who is magnificent. The Ariadne if such she be
is most beautiful & so are many others. The Laocoon I can see deserves
its reputation but it is not the sort of thing I care about. I see with
very great interest the really authentic statues & busts of Roman
emperors, & eminent Greeks—although as you know, not only no
physiognomist but totally incapable of becoming one. But I find the
pleasure which pictures & statues give me, increases with every new
experience, & I am acquiring strong preferences & discriminations which
with me I think is a sign of progress. After the gallery I was tired &
rather cold, & glad to sit in warm St Peter’s. Nothing I find grows on
me more than this building. There is a great deal of nonsense talked
about it e.g. that from being so well proportioned it does not look its
size (internally). It may not to an unpractised eye, but to any one
accustomed to great buildings it is evidently at once the largest he
ever was in. The only truth I find in the saying is that it would look
longer if it were not so high & higher if it were not so long. Whatever
part you are in the eye cannot rest for a moment on anything which is
not fine: in every direction the arches make fine perspective—& every
bit of the wall which is not gigantic sculpture or fresco is precious &
many coloured marble or gilding—the last not predominating too much as
it does in some of the gaudier churches. It is a pity that the fine
imposing monuments are all to insignificant popes. At least they have
buried Raffaelle & Annibale Caracci in the Pantheon—the last with an
affecting inscription by the painter Carlo Maratta.15—I have had Lucas
sitting with me a part of this evening talking about all manner of
things—I talking infidelity as freely as he Catholicism. I find I know a
great deal more about Italy than he does—he was never at Rome till now &
has been nowhere else in Italy & has a great deal of Rome still to see &
seems to like the idea of seeing it with me—so we shall probably go
about a good deal together when the Irish Catholic business he has come
about allows him. He expects to be detained some weeks rather waiting
than doing anything & is well disposed by way of parenthesis to go to
Naples with me when I go. This will be Edition: current; Page: [296]
pleasant. I have just discovered that there is a diligence from Rome to
Naples with coupé, which goes in two days, stopping at Terracina for the
night—can anything be pleasanter? I shall see everything & have no
trouble with vetturini.—I have looked at the windows of the old place at
the corner of the Vicolo degl’ Incurabili—the only time I have gone down
the Babuino (I went on purpose). The rooms are still to let. I am truly
happy to say there is a post daily to England, so that I shall both
receive & send letters without any unnecessary delay. Writing in this
rambling way to my darling is the nearest approach I can get (though how
unlike) to those nice talks at our dear Blackheath which she wrote so
sweetly about. A propos I did not tell her why I did not go to the Baths
of Lucca as she seems to have thought I would. They are quite high up in
a defile of the mountains, where the sun rises two hours later & sets
two hours earlier than in the plain—& are abandoned by visitors after
the end of September. I thought they would be cold, & wintry looking &
that it would not be pleasant to be there, nor could I well judge either
of the accommodations or of the beauty of so completely a summer place.
So I passed over that as well as Florence.

Jan. 17. Having taken Deakin’s prescription I am staying in doors for
the present, but I shall be able to go out before post time with this
letter. After taking mercury it will not do to go to cold galleries &
churches, but to walk in the streets will do me no harm. It is not so
fine today—there are some clouds. I have not had a drop of rain since
the day I arrived at Montpellier & almost always very fine weather—but
Lucas says that he also has never once, since he arrived here in the
beginning of December, seen a single day brighter than a fine day in
England. Evidently what one means by an Italian sky is a South of France
sky—confined in Italy to Naples & the Riviera. But at this season there
is not here even the soft purple light which we used to see in March.
The hills all round look merely wintry & not at all inviting. It may be
different at Naples & probably is so. I have not yet gone near the
antique parts of Rome, beyond coming accidentally on the temples of
Vesta & Fortuna Virilis while rambling about waiting for the opening of
the post office which was delayed by the non arrival of the courier. I
ask daily for letters but do not expect any till she has received mine
from Spezia & this sad increase of distance makes the time very long. I
expect too to hear in two or three days from Clark & Ramadge to both of
whom I wrote from Pisa about my digestion & perspirations. Adieu my
precious angel. Before this I hope she has got rid of that worrying
company16 & is enjoying quiet & the beautiful place.

Jan 18 [1855]

I went this morning to a gran funzione at St Peter’s—the festival of the
chair of St Peter—mass was said or sung before the Pope who sat on a
throne at the extreme further end of the church. Except foreigners & a
few of the populace & some women apparently of the rank of ladies for
whom tapestried seats were put up, there were few there but those who
were there officially. The music, which as usual was all vocal, gave me
no pleasure—it was either the Gregorian chant or some of that very old
church music which is much the same. When it was over I saw the
procession pass out—the cardinals & bishops followed by the Pope carried
above the heads of the crowd in his chair, then the guardia nobile & the
soldiers. I did not expect to find the Pope’s features so entirely
insignificant—he is not like an Italian. The Cardinals had all sorts of
physiognomies, austere, sensual, or bland, but almost all of them marked
features of some sort. After this I went with Lucas & a young English
priest a friend of his to the pictures in the Vatican—first Raphael’s
great frescoes, then the gallery of oil pictures & then to the statue
gallery, only stopping at the few finest. They neither of them knew half
as much as even I do about pictures & sculptures but Lucas seems to
receive pleasure from them & to be capable of learning to feel something
in them. The other seems an ignoramus, as I suspect most of the English
priests are, except the converts. I have no faith whatever in Lucas’s
catholicism. If he is a Catholic at all it is a mere opinion, or fancy
of the head. At least he is totally different from what I should be if I
believed Catholicism. Perhaps he is shy of demonstrating with me what he
thinks I should not respect—& I have thought in England that he was very
guarded with me—but I much suspect that he is so because he does not
wish me to see how little of a Catholic he really is. Not only he never
shews one atom of religious feeling, but it is evident that the things
he cares about in Rome are chiefly the memorials of ancient Rome like
any English dilettante. I think he has not half as much feeling of & for
Catholic things (at least Catholic art) as I have. He lets me have most
of the talk & it does me some good to have somebody to whet my faculties
on—he is a little better than Pope perhaps. The pictures give me great &
increasing pleasure. The frescoes by their composition & by the grace &
dignity of the separate figures—but what delighted me most was the
Madonna di Foligno,2 & next two or three Perugino’s3 and a Coronation
Edition: current; Page: [298] of the Virgin in Raphael’s first or
Perugino manner. I could stay with pleasure an indefinite time in Rome.
No doubt we should not, in the long run, like living there, but it is
the only place in this journey except Spezia, where the idea of the
possibility of living there has presented itself to me. If it were not
for the letters I should be tempted to stay here a fortnight more
instead of a week. As to health—although Deakin’s medicines have not
acted in the way he intended, either they or something else have made me
a great deal better & even stronger. My digestion seems quite coming
round—my hunger, by dinner time, is so great that though I repress it I
still eat a great deal more than I did, & nevertheless digest it better.
The weather has changed to a mild west wind & rain.—If Rolandi4 has it,
you would I think like to get from him a novel called Eugène, by Emile
Barrault5 the St Simonian—it is full of good things well said about
marriage, divorce & the position of women—the St Simonians & the
Fourierists deserve eternal gratitude for what they have done on that
subject. I go daily to the post, each day with increasing hope of a
letter from my own only darling. I think there must be one tomorrow.

Jan. 19. And here it is my precious precious one & well is it worth
going twice through the rain for it as I had to do. I am so happy that
she was at last restored to her quiet,6 & that the froissement of
feelings & nerves had done no other harm to her health than retarding
the improvement which therefore I trust began from that time. Every word
of her handwriting is so precious & so delightful—I count the days each
time till I get another. I find letters take ten days from Torquay; at
least this did, therefore I shall remain here till the 26th, this day
week. I can be in no better place at this dead time when the country has
no attractions. At this place I for the first time in this journey
(except that one day at Avignon) enjoy existence—partly because I really
digest better & have the feeling of returning though not of returned
health—partly the being stationary for a while, which rests both mind &
body—but besides I am getting quite immersed in statues & pictures. I
passed the best part of today in the Sistine & in the statue gallery. I
had no idea that I could derive so much pleasure from pictures as I did
from those of Michael Angelo in the Sistine. The more fine pictures one
sees, & the oftener one sees the same the more one enjoys them. I do not
know or understand a bit more about them than before—it is the
spontaneous development of a pleasure. I have left off reading about
pictures & I see nobody who knows or affects to know anything about
them. I mean to see all the good pictures I can while I am here or at
Naples. This would be the time & place for getting good & Edition:
current; Page: [299] cheap copies of fine pictures if my darling thinks
it would be pleasant—perhaps she will tell me what she thinks of it. By
the bye, I do not like the Transfiguration. There is a great deal of
fine in it as there must be in anything which Raphael took much pains
with but it is not a pleasing picture. There should either be
completeness of beauty perfectly satisfactory to the eye & mind or else
first rate power in a picture & in that there is neither. There are
figures quite repulsive—the kneeling woman might sit for one of the
Furies—& to see the want of power in the Christ one has only to look at
the rising & soaring figures in the Last Judgment. They seem to have no
weight—or rather soar with a force which annihilates weight. My dear one
can have no idea of that picture, having seen it in a light which was
darkness visible.—I shall see Deakin again tomorrow & perhaps he will
think it time for me to begin taking steel. I recover very slowly & have
been so much thrown back that it will need all the time from this till
Midsummer to realize the good we hoped for from this journey. My dear
one will have seen from my letters that her advice to eat much while
very careful what, was not suited to my case for I was quite unable to
digest much of anything, & now though I have a ravenous appetite & eat a
good deal more, I cannot always digest it. Deakin recommends game &
poultry rather than meat—the two days I had game for dinner I digested
better than any other day. Today I had a roast chicken & have not been
quite so well this evening; I eat them with potatoes only. I do get
stronger but it is very slowly—but long walks will come again in the
early Neapolitan if not Sicilian spring. I saw about the cholera at
Ravenna—that coast is I fancy the only part of Italy in which there is
cholera now (if it is still there). The robbers there I fancy are
patriots. How bravely the Sardinian government is keeping up the fight
with the priests.7 You will have seen darling that I at last got all
your dear letters. I was probably mistaken in supposing that Allen’s oil
agrees better with me than the others. Here in Italy it has not done at
all better & Deakin advised me to leave it off. What gave me the idea
was that I began to digest badly at Torquay & laid the blame on the oil
I got there, but I now fancy it must have been something more deeply
rooted. Deakin says there is very good cod liver oil here & before
leaving here I shall replenish. It is now very mild here but thoroughly
rainy—it rains much in the day & torrents every night.—Lucas & his
friend have just been here to say that they have got an admission to the
Pope’s palace in the Quirinal & I have agreed to go there with them
tomorrow & then to go to the Rospigliosi palace & other places in the
same neighbourhood. As my darling has not said anything to the contrary
this will be the last letter I send to Torquay. I shall direct next to
Blackheath unless I hear meanwhile that Edition: current; Page: [300]
she will stay the three months (instead of two) there, which I most
earnestly hope that she will & that the weather will be mild enough to
make the smoke a minor evil. I have twice or thrice been troubled with
smoky chimneys, but by extreme good luck have never once had wet or bad
wood—the bellows which had such hard work in our Nice journey, has had
almost a sinecure. I fear I have not got on with my Italian at a rate at
all corresponding with my first start. When I got unwell I felt
disinclined to the great exertion of talking in a language one does not
know. I shall do better hereafter. With returning health & the pleasure
of this place I find my activity of mind greater than it has been since
I set out & I think I shall be able & disposed to write a very good
volume on Liberty,8 if we decide that that is to be the subject. Ah
darling how very deeply I feel the sweet & kind things you write & how I
bless her for them.

Jan. 20. It is a fine morning dearest though it does not yet look like a
change of weather. I feel very well, as I generally do in the mornings;
& expect a pleasant day. I shall make the most of this week—At present
it feels as if any place would be very flat which does not contain St
Peter’s. I shall put this in the post while I am out. adieu & a hundred
thousand loves & blessings.

Too late, alas, for the post—so I reopen to give the latest bulletin. I
went to the Quirinal; to the Rospigliosi, to Sta Maria Maggiore, to St
Pietro in Vincoli & returned by the Colosseum & the Forum—a very long &
interesting day’s work. There were few pictures which I cared much about
except the Aurora of Guido9 at the Rospigliosi. The engravings from it
are hacknied but the original fresco raised Guido very much in my mind.
I do not place it much below Raphael. There is also a very nice Speranza
by Guido in the sacristie of S. Pietro in Vincoli. But the grand thing
there is M. Angelo’s Moses, certainly one of the noblest statues in
existence—nobler perhaps than any Greek. S. Maria Maggiore you know—it
is internally the finest specimen of a Basilica I have seen. The
Colosseum looks much larger & finer than I expected—the difference
between it & the amphitheatres at Arles & Nimes is incalculable. They
are making great new excavations in the Forum & have got down to old
pavements & foundations of buildings which throw quite a new light on
the localities—among others they have discovered the exact place of the
Rostra—I find Lucas has made a complete study of these old sites & can
explain everything to me like an accomplished Cicerone, while I can
instruct him in Christian art. Does not that tell tales? I must go back
to these scenes alone. It began to come on me like a quite new feeling,
that of Edition: current; Page: [301] the relics of the old city among
gardens & country—after I have been filled full of the modern town. I
must go back & realize it. You see darling that I am enjoying the full
advantage of a second visit. All the inevitable disappointments were got
over in the first & I now have eyes only for what is fine, & there is so
much of that, that it has put me in as much of a state of tranquil
enjoyment as I can have anywhere without you. I am the better too for
having somebody to talk with but I furnish nearly all the talk & Lucas
would have quite wearied me by this time at Pisa or anywhere that had
comparatively little to see & little to interest. I have not seen Deakin
today—he is seldom at home till afternoon & today I let pass the
suitable hours then. But I have cared less about it because my digestion
seems steadily improving & I am perfectly well otherwise—without even
any more or worse expectoration than in England—but still my strength
comes back very slowly. I see the English papers daily—Times, Chronicle
& (strange to say) the Leader. The adhesion of the Sardinian government
to the alliance may be a good stroke of policy for Sardinia but very bad
for Italy & the world—it chains Sardinia to Louis Napoleon & sends away
the only disciplined soldiers of Italy to die in a cause not
Italian10—adieu once again my darling darling love.

In my enumeration of the places I went over yesterday, my treasure, I
omitted the vast remains of the Baths of Diocletian, two small parts of
which have been made into two churches, one of them (designed by M.
Angelo) very large & magnificent & a part of the remainder forms a great
convent of Carthusians whose curious greyish white habit I for the first
time saw. Among the pictures which struck me I omitted a beautiful
Annunciation by Guido in the private chapel of the Pope’s palace on the
Quirinal. The palace itself contained nothing but what one would expect:
save some quite recent Gobelin tapestry which the eye could not
distinguish from fresco painting. Today I went to the basilica of St
Agnes a mile outside the Porta Pia to see the ceremony of blessing the
lambs. Two pretty little creatures, white & woolly & decked out with
ribbons, well trained to be quiet, were first carried about the church
to be admired & caressed, then laid on the altar, where a Edition:
current; Page: [302] form of words was said over them & they were
sprinkled with holy water: this was the ceremony. I had proof here that
there is fine church music in Italy for I heard one of the finest masses
conceivable sung to the organ like Warwick Street or Moorfields.2 This
is the day they bless the horses at St Antony’s church, near Sta Maria
Maggiore. All day horses were being ridden or driven there (from the
Pope’s to those of the poorest person who had a horse) caparisoned to
their utmost & when they got to the church a priest came out, read the
form & sprinkled them. After seeing this I went to St Paolo fuori le
Mura3 [sic], the great basilica which was burnt down but has now been
rebuilt as fine as ever & is one of the largest & most splendid churches
of Rome. What a change of times when the altars are encrusted with
malachite given by Nicholas4 a schismatic prince & the four pillars of
porphyry which support the baldacchino were a present from the Mussulman
Mehemet Ali.5 Returning I went over the cemetery of foreigners—English,
Germans & Russians chiefly—& found out the tombs of Keats & Shelley, the
last the simplest & most modest of flat stones, the first a small
headstone with a pathetic epitaph ending with the words dictated by
himself “Here lies one whose name was writ in water.” Some time both
ought to be removed like Napoleon’s when there is a fit place to receive
them. But it will never be to an English but to some cosmopolite
Pantheon. I also saw the tomb of Goethe’s son6 who died here a year
before his father. Lucas who went with me to all these places was
evidently much interested—I am more & more confirmed in my opinion of
the little that his Catholicism amounts to. I must make the amende to
his friend the Rev. Mr Kyne7 (or Kyan) for though he is certainly not a
man of information, Lucas says he devotes & has for many years devoted
his whole life to going about among the poorest of the poor in
Clerkenwell & is here to recruit his health injured by that exertion. He
is living here with Talbot,8 the Pope’s chamberlain in the Vatican.
There is no end to the English & Irish & even American priests here.
There is some hardship at the English & Irish colleges for there are no
fires whatever (except the Edition: current; Page: [303] fire for
cooking). This is no trifle for it can be very cold at Rome. Yesterday &
today it has been cold as well as wet with much rain & occasional
hail—the Tiber is swollen into a full rapid dark muddy stream & the
adjacent parts of Rome & of the country are flooded. There is fresh snow
on parts even of the Alban hills. Certainly there is no temptation to
stir out of the town.

Jan. 22. I saw Deakin again today & he thinks me so much better that he
does not advise me even to take steel. He draws the most favorable
augury from the manner in which my digestive functions have recovered
themselves & thinks I shall soon get back my strength: so far so good.
It has been finer today though not without rain. I went to see the
Borghese pictures with Lucas & afterwards met him unexpectedly at the
museum of the Capitol. The Borghese collection pleased me much—there are
no first rate specimens of the very first masters but a very good
selection from the different schools; it is richest in Roman & old
Tuscan, & the gems are two or three Francias.9 The admiration of Francia
I thought mere pedantic humbug from the much belauded specimen in our
National Gallery, but from the pictures of his I have since seen I rate
him very high. The picture gallery at the Capitol is about equal to the
Borghese; I liked best a Fra Bartolomeo & some Venetian portraits. The
ancient sculptures are fully equal, for their number, to those at the
Vatican; the Dying Gladiator perhaps superior to any. There are some
reliefs of scenes in which Marcus Aurelius is introduced which appear to
me quite wonderful & are very delightful to me from my extreme
admiration of the man. The place is full too of curiosities: the brazen
she wolf of Romulus which was struck with lightning at the time of
Julius Caesar’s death: the fragments of a most curious plan of old Rome,
unfortunately dug up in many small pieces: the original Fasti Consulares
also fragmentary but in large fragments, going back to some of the
consulships preceding the Decemvirate. All these are believed genuine by
Niebuhr & the most critical judges who have fully examined the evidence.
These are much more interesting to me than the remains of Roman
buildings, which with two or three exceptions are very ugly & all very
much alike. Lucas says his business at Rome is coming to a crisis: he
came to prevail on the Pope to take off the interdict lately laid on
priests against interfering in politics: if he cannot succeed in this,
he & others mean to give up politics for the present. Cullen, the
Archbishop, is the head of the party opposed to him & he & Cullen are to
meet this week by desire of the Pope, to try if they cannot arrange
matters amicably:10 if not, the Pope will have to decide between them. I
conjecture that the interdict, so absurd in a Catholic point of view was
procured by Louis Napoleon to prevent the English government from being
embarrassed by Ireland during Edition: current; Page: [304] this war.
Lucas thinks it is not this, but Cullen’s Whiggish inclinations, & it is
curious that while Cullen was supported in getting the Archbishopric on
the one hand by MacHale,11 on the other, if Lucas says true, Lord
Clarendon12 was writing the strongest letters in his support on the
ground of his being a perfectly safe man: three people known to Lucas
have he says seen a letter from Ld Clarendon to the brother of More
O’Ferrall13 to that effect. This shews skilful duplicity in Cullen at
all events. I heard from Ramadge today (not yet from Clark). R. has told
me what to do if the perspirations return. Deakin does not seem to like
my leaving Rome so soon, but if I continue to get better I shall go next
Monday, being the first day of the three times a week diligence after
the day I expect my darling’s letters of the 16th. You see dearest I am
making the most of Rome & it is giving me as much pleasure as I am
capable of having in this solitary journey. In such weather too as I
have had I could have done little in the way of country walks even if I
had been stronger. I have a great deal of walking in Rome, & though I
sit down all I can, always am very tired before I come in to dinner at
five. I have got Eustace’s Tour14 & am reading it: things have got on
since then. He travelled in 1802: scarcely even an octogenarian now is
such an old twaddler. Every thought & every principle of judgment he has
on great matters or small has been obsolete these 30 years. Yet I must
have been born when it was published or very soon after. It interests me
because it is full of quotations from the Latin poets & applies them to
the places.—Lucas says that Ward15 lives at the Catholic college in
Hertfordshire, & though a layman gives lectures on dogmatic theology &
is preparing a treatise thereon. He has lately had a bad illness.
Perhaps he is more likely to think himself out of Catholicism in England
than to look himself out of it here. I no longer think that coming to
Italy should cure the converts. There is nothing to the eye that
contradicts the professions, & as to the mind, there are no doubt still
learned doctors of theology as there always have been.

Jan. 23. I have received today my darling’s letter of the 13th which
makes me very anxious & uneasy about her, & especially about that pain
in the chest—it Edition: current; Page: [305] reconciles me to her going
so soon to Blackheath, because she will be nearer to good medical
treatment. My angel if it continues, pray see either Tuson16 or
Ferguson.17 It was likely enough that having held out as long as those
irritating circumstances lasted you would break down or have an illness
immediately after—that we know is the commonest of common turns of
affairs—it is most unfortunate that anxiety caused by my letters should
have come exactly at that crisis. It is the greatest comfort to know
that the Pisa letter relieved the anxiety & I hope none of those which
followed will have brought it back. My angel knows by this time that
there is nothing to be alarmed about, but there is a great deal of time
lost. I was weighed this morning at an English saddler’s on the ground
floor of the very house in which we passed so many days together. I
found I had lost 15 pounds since Avignon, being the eight I had gained &
seven more. I of course knew I must have lost a good deal but did not
expect so much. There is all this lee way to make up, & nearly two
months of the time gone. But I dare say as Deakin says, I shall recover
strength & flesh very fast when my digestion is once right. The worst is
that though it is now pretty right in the main it still requires the
utmost care—Careful as I am I have very few days entirely free from
indigestion. I begin to get impatient of the loss of precious time. The
time here at Rome passes pleasantly enough, but that is not what I came
here for, & such pleasure is not worth going or staying away from home
for. I passed the greater part of today in the Vatican, seeing the old
things over again & some which I had not seen—among these the workshop
of the mosaic workers, those who copy in mosaic the great pictures—also
tapestry said to be from cartoons by Raphael, 23 of them, among which
all the seven at Hampton Court18—but these seven are so infinitely
superior to any of the others that I cannot believe the rest to be by
Raphael. They must be by his pupils. The Transfiguration improves on
better acquaintance by the aid of a better light,19 the day being at
last fine. I think the left hand half of the lower part of the picture
as fine as anything ever painted & the right hand half is better than I
thought. There is a very fine Isaiah by Raphael—in the stile of the
prophets of M. Angelo in the Sistine, which is in the church of St.
Agostino here. I saw it today, having been struck with the copy of it in
mosaic which had just been finished at the workshop. I continue to
dislike the Meleager20—but I must add to the first rate statues one I
had not much noticed before, an athlete scraping himself, I suppose
after a contest. That, the Apollo, the Antinous-Mercury, the Dying
Gladiator & the Moses seem to me the finest statues I have seen, but
there are some most glorious portrait-statues Edition: current; Page:
[306] of philosophers, orators & Roman emperors, a Lysias, a Demosthenes
& a Nerva, besides many others. The enormous multitudes of everything
are most impressive here: each of the innumerable fountains has its
large or small group & in every garden or common pleasure place of any
sort all the ornaments are antiques—mostly statues or reliefs—so that
one comes to feel it one’s natural state to be surrounded by them. Then
the originals of the great pictures walk about the streets & meet you
everywhere. I am continually seeing exactly the same heads & figures
which are in the pictures—male chiefly, for the women as elsewhere
disappoint, though they are handsomer here than anywhere else in Italy.
By the bye I went once to the opera (the pit is all in stalls, the price
two pauls, about tenpence) (but staid only one act, of Rossini’s
Cenerentola).21 Cinderella & her two sisters were I should think the
three ugliest old women in Italy—the sisters looked disagreeable as
well, which was in the esprit of their rôle—as for Cinderella she looked
a bonne grosse paysanne who was exactly in her place & never ought to
have been taken out of it. Every box in a very large house was full,
though through the Carnival there is an opera every night at two
theatres. I never saw such a display of large faces. The Roman women are
so made by nature & they heighten it by putting their hair entirely off
their faces. What the common people are like except outwardly I have not
found out & do not well know how for I am not thrown among them here. I
wonder she should find such rambling & superficial letters interesting
or amusing. You should not my darling write in ink—I can read the pencil
perfectly & do not my love write when it is painful—or write only how
you are my own precious angel—it is delightful to read her letters but
when I know each one costs her much pain & does her real harm I had much
rather only hear how she is in a note from Lily. Good night darling & a
thousand loves.

Jan. 24. I kept the letter open to say that all is well this morning. I
am going to pass a day alone among the ruins. Addio mia divina.

Jan. 24 [1855]

23

This has been a very full day & I will give an account of it to my
darling. I set out rather discouraged about myself, being less well than
usual, but I have been on foot from 10 till 5, & though I often sat
down, it was never for Edition: current; Page: [307] long—& I walked
with more spirit at last than at first & felt tired only in the way I
used after the long walks at our dear Blackheath. So I hope I am getting
back my strength. After putting my letter into the post I went across
the Capitol & walked or rather scrambled all about the Palatine, looking
from that deserted hill over all Rome & especially the Trastevere. The
Palatine is all kitchen gardens except a villa of an Englishman named
Mills,2 one of the most gimcrack erections possible but apparently very
nicely planted & in a most enviable site. I then went round by the
Colosseum & the arches of Titus & Constantine into the line of the
Circus Maximus which leads past the immense remains of the Baths of
Caracalla (looking like fragments of a mountain) towards the Appian Way.
Presently I saw written up on the left “Sepulcra Scipionum” so I went
in. It is a succession of vaults & winding passages cut out in the rock,
which served as the graves of all the Scipios from the Scipio Barbatus,3
greatgrandfather of Africanus,4 whose tomb makes so great a figure in
the Vatican Museum, to Scipio Asiaticus5 the brother of Africanus.
Africanus himself was not buried here but at Cumae where he died in
exile. Everything that could be removed from this sepulchre has been
taken to the Vatican except the long funerary inscriptions which mark
the place where each body was deposited & identify the persons. After
this I saw what was much more curious, several columbaria:6 first one
small shew one, then seeing the word inscribed I went into a private
ground & met the owner who very politely shewed me two very large & fine
columbaria which he had discovered in his grounds & most curious they
are. These are the places built as repositories for the ashes of those
who were burnt—square chambers deep sunk in the ground, with steps
descending to them & all the sides from top to bottom laid out as it
were in shelves & pigeon holes with the ashes of 6, 8, or 12 persons on
each shelf in various receptacles, each with an inscription shewing the
name & rank of each person, & often with a small bust, glass vessels for
libations &c. These places not having been dismantled are nearly as the
Romans left them & they bring one into the midst of Roman life (for
death is the greatest incident of life) in a way nothing else does. The
proprietor has found a third of these which appears to have belonged to
persons of consular rank & promises he says to be still more curious—it
is not quite excavated yet but he invited me to come & see it in three
or four days. After this I went out at the Appian gate, Porta San
Edition: current; Page: [308] Sebastiano, & walked some miles along the
road which coincides with the old Appian way, passing the tomb of
Cæcilia Metella7 & the very large remains of the Circus of Romulus (the
son of Maxentius)8 about the size of a modern race course (which it was)
but in the large brick buildings all round for the spectators much of
which is still left. A little beyond the monument of Cæcilia (you know
that round tower shaped like the Castle of St Angelo) the original
pavement of the Appian Way is for some distance uncovered & forms the
present road—but the present Pope is uncovering the whole line further
on for many miles & you can see it going strait [sic] to the horizon
across the long arm of the Mountain of Albano, while under your feet are
the original old blocks which Horace trod on in his journey to
Brundusium.9 This road goes over a succession of slopes & hollows
forming a hilly boundary to the plain between Rome & Albano & from it is
seen the entire ensemble of those long broken aqueducts which you
remember with the range of the Sabine mountains behind, making a fine &
characteristic picture. I returned to Rome by the way I came, but
instead of going in at the Appian gate, wound round the outside of the
walls of Rome to the gate of St John Lateran & went into that fine
basilica: the finest church in Rome except St Peter’s. It does not look
fine at a distance but when you are near enough to feel the effect of
the colossi on the roof presided over by the gigantic St John bearing
his tall cross, it is imposing. The façade too is very fine & from the
side next the city it groups well with the Pope’s palace of Lateran
adjoining. Almost all the churches at Rome, however fine inside, are
mean & ugly outside. This & S. Maria Maggiore are the only exceptions,
save St Peter’s which is not ugly but worse for the exterior so dwarfs
what ought to be the grandest building in existence that even the
obelisk in front seems to bear an appreciable proportion to it. I
returned to the inn by the region of the Monti: from the Lateran to S.
Maria Maggiore is a macadamised road between high walls planted with
trees on both sides, down one slope & up another with the two basilicas
closing the view both ways & I could not help turning round every minute
to have another look at the Lateran in the sweet evening light. Then
through the church of S. Maria & along the Via delle quattre Fontane
which ends at the Trinità de’ Monti. It was the first day of pleasant
air & climate I have had at Rome—all the others were either cold or
rainy. I do not know if my darling cares to read about all these
minutiae—I spare her a great many of the minor things I see but when I
am much pleased or interested I always write it out directly. These
deserted parts of Rome, country & country roads within the walls,
Edition: current; Page: [309] with no houses but here & there a bastide
or a villa (but now & then a splendid church or a great convent) have a
great charm to me.—Lucas has just been here. He has had his meeting with
Cullen today, finds him very hostile—no chance of an amicable
arrangement10—means to stay here & fight it out—but can do nothing just
at present therefore thinks he shall be able to go to Naples—& if so Mr
Kyan proposes to go too. So we shall be a party of three. I should have
liked Lucas better without Kyan but he is not disagreeable nor much in
the way. We shall see. Meanwhile they are going with me to some more
pictures tomorrow.

Jan. 25. I am in the best of spirits today about my own health but
anxious & impatient to hear of hers. I have bought Murray’s Guide to
Naples11 & its territory which I find will be very useful. I find from
it that to go to Reggio by land is perfectly safe & usual & that there
is a diligence (the mail) the only obstacle to my going by which is the
very small amount of luggage which the mail takes; so it will depend on
my finding on enquiry that the steamboat & the inn at Reggio can be
trusted with the rest of my luggage. I shall advise with the banker
thereon. Vetturini in abundance go that road but I do not like that so
well. If I had one or two companions we could post. Anyhow I feel no
doubt now of getting to Sicily somehow so darling if you are pretty
well, do not direct again to Naples. If you are worse I certainly will
not go further off till you are better but of this I hope the letters I
shall receive at Naples will tell me fully. If you are doing well please
dear write once to Messina such a letter as you would not mind losing, &
not again till you hear from me again. I shall find out immediately
after reaching Naples, how it is to be. Lucas has just been here to say
he can go, so if we can get the three coupé places for Monday we shall
go then. I saw Deakin again today: he thinks me much better, as I am, &
quite fit to travel again. But what chiefly encourages me is that I feel
decidedly stronger in spite of the extra walk yesterday, or perhaps in
consequence of it. I begin to feel some excitement about seeing
Calabria. It must be splendidly beautiful. Today I have seen many fine
things. In the morning I went with Lucas & Kyne to the Farnesina where
are the frescoes of Cupid & Psyche designed by Raphael & coloured by his
pupils, & the fresco of Galatea by himself: the first pleased me as much
as I expected, the last not quite so much, but with frescoes by
Sebastiano del Piombo12 & others the room has altogether the only fine
specimen I have seen of how a room may & should be ornamented in this
stile—every hole & corner filled with something graceful & the whole
blending Edition: current; Page: [310] in perfect harmony. There are
also some beautiful frescoes at this palace by Bazzi of Siena13 whom
some other pictures I have seen of his make me place very high. He was a
cotemporary of Raphael. We then went to three churches in the
Trastevere, two of them on the Janiculum having by far the finest views
of Rome, all of which is spread out below with its background of
mountains—One of them S. Onofrio where Tasso died & is buried & where
are still the remains of his oak14—the main trunk of which was blown
down in 1841. The other is S. Pietro in Montorio. In all three there are
fine pictures. In the afternoon I went by myself to the Palazzo
Barberini to see one of the finest small collections of pictures in
Rome: the original Beatrice Cenci,15 as much surpassing the copies as
they usually do; & a portrait of the wife of Cenci, Lucrezia:16 the real
Fornarina17 by Raphael—quite unlike the one at Florence which according
to Stendhal is neither the Fornarina nor a Raphael18—this exactly
corresponds with a Fornarina by Giulio Romano19 in the Borghese, & is a
disagreeable looking woman but a splendid picture, with that peculiar
glow of colour which I find nowhere but in Raphael & with him only in
his latest manner & which, it seems to me, is the greatest merit of the
Transfiguration. There is also a fine Titian, a Francia & an Andrea del
Sarto quite first rate, & a very fine Bazzi & Giovanni Bellini.20 I
Edition: current; Page: [311] must see as many of the remaining palaces
as possible tomorrow for they are often not open on Saturday & Sunday—We
found the Corsini closed today for a week—such ill luck will happen. I
have just now appointed with Lucas to see the Doria & Sciarra21 tomorrow
& perhaps others. Wherever one goes after Rome, must be inferior in the
way of art, & it must be natural beauty that is to be the compensation.
At Naples the one gallery is full of treasures but one is not surrounded
by art in all shapes as one is here—but spring is coming—Candlemas which
even at Rome they call the first day of spring, will be here immediately
& the meadows of Proserpine come into bloom early. If I am easy about my
darling’s health I hope the remaining five months will be pleasant &
profitable & perhaps she will be able to meet me before the end of them.
Adieu my own, my divinest, most adored angel.

Jan. 26. All well this morning my beloved. I shall post this when I go
out & I hope find one at the post office.

No letter today—& rather fear she did not get mine in time to write on
the 16th in which case I fear I shall not hear till I get to Naples.
That will be on the 31st, the places being taken for Monday, two
banquettes & one coupé being the best we could do. I saw the Doria
gallery today (a wet day) with Lucas & Kyne & the Colonna & Braschi
palaces by myself. The Doria disappointed me—it is a very large
collection & would make a sufficient national gallery for a second rate
kingdom, but most of the pictures seemed to me third rate. There is
however one long corridor full of portraits by Titian, Giorgione &
Rubens—in this was also a fine Francia, & (very like Francia) a Giovanni
Bellini: these two & Perugino have a complete family likeness—a Leonardo
which though called a portrait of the second Giovanna of Naples2 is
vastly like his one always recurring face—& finally the Magdalen of
Titian, a splendid picture, perfectly satisfactory & pleasurable in
execution (conception apart) but as a Magdalen ridiculous. I have seen
many Titians at Rome & they all strengthen my old feeling about him—he
is of the earth Edition: current; Page: [312] earthy. At the other two
palaces there were some fine pictures, the majority portraits by the
Venetians—at the Braschi the so called Bella of Titian, which I don’t
like, & what is reckoned a chef d’oeuvre of Corregio of whom there are
few good specimens here which I don’t like either though I can see that
it may have strong points of colouring. Lots of Gaspar Poussins3 at all
three, deadly cold, & several ambitious Salvators,4 to my feeling quite
poor: a St John & his famous Belisarius, which seems to me inferior to
the poorest even of the Bolognese painters. Evidently the culmination of
painting was in the three generations of which Raphael forms the last,
Titian belonging to it also though as he lived nearly 60 years longer
than Raphael one fancies him of a later date. The worship of the still
earlier painters is a dandyism which will not last, even I hope in
Germany: the contempt of the Bolognese eclectics who came a century
after has a foundation of reason but is grossly exaggerated. Guido
especially has risen greatly with me from what I have seen at Rome & so
has even Domenichino5 whose finest pictures are here: him however I do
not, as a matter of taste, care the least about. But I begin to think
Ruskin right about Gaspard & Salvator, perhaps even Claude,6 & to think
the modern English landscape painting better than theirs. If I did not
write my impressions every day I should not write them at all, for
seeing so many pictures one remembrance drives out another—but they
leave a total impression extremely agreeable. I never was immersed in
pictures before, & probably never shall be again to the same degree, for
at any place but Rome one hardly can be, & even at Rome with her, there
would be so much greater activity of other parts of the mind that the
atmosphere would be different. Even the season & the bad weather
contribute by throwing me upon the indoor pleasures of the place: My
dearest may well smile at my pretension of giving opinions about
pictures, but as all I say about them is the expression of real feelings
which they give or which they fail to give me, what I say though
superficial is genuine & may go for what it is worth—it does not come
from books or from other people, & I write it to her because it shews
her that I have real pleasure here & have made really the most of Rome
in that respect & in others.

Jan. 27. No letter still & I now feel no doubt that mine arrived too
late for the 16th. I have just got information which takes away all
doubt about my going to Greece, unless my health should take some bad
turn. This is, that the Austrian Lloyd’s steamers from Ancona to Corfu
which take only 48 hours the whole way, touch at Brindisi so that if I
go there from Naples Edition: current; Page: [313] which is perfectly
easy, the passage across will be the shortest possible, 12 hours at
most. This is capital. Today I have been seeing all that I had left
unseen. I always do a great deal more when I go about alone. Besides
mounting the tower of the Capitol for the fine panoramic view of Rome &
descending to the Mamertine prison7 under it: a frightful dungeon into
which people were let down through a hole, reputed here to be the place
where St Peter & St Paul were confined & wrought sundry miracles but to
me interesting from the more authentic fact that it was the place where
Catiline’s associates8 were put to death—besides this & what remains of
the Tarpeian rock & the Cloaca Maxima & several other ruins & walking
all over the Ghetto or Jews’ quarter which is no longer locked up at
night, the present Pope having pulled down all the gates—besides all
this I saw quantities more of pictures, Raphael’s famous Sibyls at Sta
Maria della Pace, a beautiful fresco, though I could not see any
inspiration in the Sibyls—the Palazzo Sciarra where is the real Bella of
Titian, the one I saw yesterday being either a copy or a reproduction,
but Titian where he has not gorgeous colours is to me little—also a fine
Leonardo but always the same face. The Palazzo Spada where are some very
ambitious & I think bad Guido’s (as there are also at the Sciarra
including one very celebrated Magdalen called delle Radici) but one
Magdalen by Guido quite unlike his usual type & which seemed to me
exquisite. Three or four Francia, Perugino & Fra Bartolomeo, always
agreeable, & some of Andrea del Sarto whom I like less than at first as
I see he can only paint in one stile & most of his pictures seem like
imitations of himself. There is a Leonardo at the Spada exactly like
Christ & the Doctors in the National Gallery. There is at this palace a
colossal statue of Pompey9 supposed to be the very one at the foot of
which Caesar fell, & if it is not it, it deserves to be—it is exactly
what one would wish that statue to be. I spare you the churches, ruins
&c of minor note which I saw. There are now hardly any pictures of note
in Rome which I have not seen, & many of the finest repeatedly. As it is
now probable I shall not return to Rome, I am glad to have made the
impression complete & strong. I have been reading some parts of a book
of some celebrity “Rome in the 19th century.”10 It is Edition: current;
Page: [314] on the index11 but books which are so appear to be tolerated
at the English circulating libraries. The writer (I forgot her name) is
a pert, prejudiced, ignorant, rash, vulgar minded English or more
probably Scotch woman & her book, what she says all other books about
Rome are, worthless, except for some details of information. I have
seldom read a book which made my bile overflow so much & I have paid her
off in the margin of the book. Eustace12 is a god compared to her.—I was
quite sorry to see Emilia’s death13 in the Times of the 19th. The same
paper contained the death (aged 42) of one of the most valuable men in
India, Goldsmid the Bombay Secretary.14 A few days ago I saw Mr Ley’s
death:15 how will that affect Arthur? I was weighed again today before
going away: I had neither gained nor lost. There could not be much
difference in so short a time, but I hoped for a little. I seem to be
going on improving & I think the change to Naples will now be useful.

Jan. 28. No letter—I have left written instructions with the post office
people to send letters on. Yesterday was bright & rather cold, today is
violent rain, with a north wind too—which only ceased late in the
afternoon when I tried to have a walk but the ground was too wet for me
to do much. I stept into Sta Maria del Popolo in time of vespers where
the organist was trilling away like a comic opera. I should have liked
to have had a fine day for my last look at Rome & had meditated a
country walk, but it was not to be. When I have paid my bill here my
journey will have cost me up to this time (deducting the fees to Deakin,
medicine & everything else not properly chargeable to travelling &
living) as nearly as possible £50. That is for about seven weeks & a
half of time, but the distance travelled is considerable. I shall post
this at the moment of leaving, (seven tomorrow morning), for the
diligences start from the very court yard of the post office. How
anxious I am for the letter I shall find at Naples, that I may know how
she is, or rather was, for the worst part of this distance is that all
the intelligence of health is already old when it arrives—adieu
darling—adieu my own dearest love. This is a poor letter but she will
not mind. Bless her. Adieu.

I arrived here late yesterday evening my own precious love & this
morning went for letters but to my great disappointment found none—which
considering how poor an account of your health the last gave me, makes
me very uneasy & anxious—it is quite right my darling, not to write long
letters when it is painful & hurtful, but half a dozen words either from
her dear self or from Lily to say how she is would be the greatest
comfort & relief—that is really what I care about—the rest is delightful
to have but not painful to be without. As the letter I expected did not
come to Rome I made sure of finding it here but I looked over all they
had with the letter M & found none. If one is lost it is an unlucky
coincidence. We came here, Lucas & Kyne & I, by an excellent diligence
stopping the night at Terracina. The first day was bright & fine, with a
good deal of ice; the snow very low down on the mountains & the hills
about Albano & the view of & from the Pontine marshes were most
beautiful, though the day was not clearer than the least clear of the
fine days we had at Torquay. We took a pleasant moonlight walk round
part of the Bay of Fondi. The second day yesterday was soaking rain like
the day we were at the Sistine that Palm Sunday—& the beauty of Mola di
Gaeta & all that beautiful road was entirely non existent. Today it has
not rained but the clouds have not cleared off—Vesuvius, Capri & nearly
all the coast have been invisible—it has been useless going to the
Strada Nuova di Posilipo & all we could do was to walk about the town &
go to the Museum where we went through all the Pompeii & Herculaneum
rooms preparatory to going to Pompeii. Naples otherwise looks just the
same as it did but I do not find my reminiscences of it nearly so
distinct and accurate as those of Rome & Pisa. On the strength of Murray
we came to a lately established inn on the Chiatamone called the Hotel
des Etrangers expecting to find it as good & cheaper than the old inns
which are all extremely dear, & we are not disappointed: we have a very
good sitting room with a fireplace & three very decent bedrooms (one of
them with a fireplace) for two piastres a day, about eight shillings
which for Naples is cheap. It is true they are au quatrième but we have
all the better view. My future movements are quite uncertain. All the
improvement I had made in a fortnight of perfect regularity & choice
diet at Rome did not hinder me from having a thorough indigestion each
of the two days of travelling; the fact is my digestion will not stand
the irregular hours which travelling necessitates nor the inferior &
less digestible food which you get at the inns. It remains to be seen
whether I shall ever again digest as I Edition: current; Page: [316]
used to do. The good side of the matter is that I got better as soon as
I arrived here & have felt as well today as I did at Rome. It is curious
that the morning meal, of eggs tea & toast never disagrees with me: it
is always the dinner, & whatever that is composed of, I invariably have
some little indigestion, & unless I have tea directly after, a good
deal. Tea seems to be an absolute necessary of life to me now, & I
ascribe much of the indigestion yesterday to not having been able to
have tea before I set out. You see dear unless I get much better while I
remain at Naples it is out of the question going to Reggio by the
courier—if I go by land at all it must be by voiture & taking provisions
with me i.e. a great supply of macaroni which I can cook myself & on
which I believe I can live without inconvenience. But there is little
chance of my having any companion—There is nobody I know here in the
books of the English library, though there are quantities of English or
Americans. Lucas is evidently much tempted to go on to Sicily but does
not seem likely to be able to manage it. And it is quite uncertain
whether I shall be in sufficiently confirmed health to go at all. If
not, I shall stay here all February & go to Rome in March. So darling I
must ask her to direct here, such letters as she would not much mind
losing, & if I go to Sicily we must take the chance of the people at the
post office here sending them on as the Pisa people most faithfully did.
The people in the Neapolitan territory are more than ever the rogues of
Italy: they always try to cheat in changing money: everywhere else the
custom house officers appear to be no longer bribed but here they are
more openly venal than ever, they ask or rather demand the bribe:—&
custom houses have been multiplied to multiply the occasions of it.
Besides the one at Fondi there is one at Mola di Gaeta now, which & the
one at Naples we bought off without their opening anything: at Fondi
they did open, but let everything pass. The Strada Toledo is as noisy &
crowded as ever, but has now trottoirs, which none of the other streets
yet have. The Chiaja looks very pretty & the Grotta di Posilipo much
more curious than I thought. I do not like her to be longer without a
letter, so I shall post this first thing tomorrow morning when I go to
ask for letters—so adieu my darling of darlings.

No letter yet & I should be seriously alarmed if I did not force myself
to think that a letter must have miscarried. I think of all sorts of
evils that can have happened—& of all sorts of misunderstandings that
can have prevented Edition: current; Page: [317] a letter from coming.
Is it possible that you did not know where to write after you ceased
writing to Rome & that you have been waiting for a letter to tell you?
But you know my darling love that whatever I might do afterwards I
should go first to Naples when I left Rome. I am so anxious that I do
not at all like going to Paestum tomorrow but as it is the only day
which will suit Lucas & Kyne who talk of returning to Rome in two or
three days I think it best to do it—& on the whole after going to the
post office twice every day for four days I find that perpetual renewal
of disappointment harder to bear than a couple of days intermission
which leaves at least a stronger hope that I shall find a letter when it
is over—mind dearest by a letter I only mean a few words from your dear
self or Lily saying how you are—all the rest is de luxe, that only is
necessity. We have had very poor weather since we came—we have never
seen the Bay till today—We went this afternoon to the Strada Nuova di
Posilipo on which we had not set foot before & though the day was more
hazy than any I saw at Torquay it was still fine enough to more than
surpass my expectations & recollections of both views, that towards
Sorrento & Capri on one side & that towards Pozzuoli & Ischia on the
other. We went to Pompeii one day which was tolerably fine, though the
lowering clouds only let us see Vesuvius or the bay by occasional
glimpses. Pompeii you have seen & therefore I need not describe it.
There is nothing doing there, & hardly any more of it uncovered than in
our time—only one house of any importance. The amphitheatre however
which we did not see is well worth seeing, being the only one I have
seen in which the seats or a great part of them remain, & the place
therefore looks like what it was & not like a mere ruin. The railway is
the shabbiest & dirtiest, I mean the carriages, that I have seen
anywhere—au reste well managed in essentials. We have passed a great
deal of time in the Museum but have not yet seen any of the pictures,
for it shuts every day at two, & yesterday was shut altogether. I think
as I did before that the collection of Greek statues is the finest for
its size I ever saw—the average much higher than in the Vatican—& this
although I thought neither the Toro Farnese nor the Hercules equal to
their reputation—the famous Aristides (now called Aeschines) not finer
than many other statues not celebrated—& the precious King of Naples2
has shut up the Venus Callipyge & the other Venuses on pretext of public
decency—the Pope too has done the same to the Venus of the Capitol. If
these things are done in Italy what shall we come to next? I take it as
a matter of course that the Venus de Medici will be under lock & key by
the time we go to Florence. I think the Pompeii frescoes in the Museum &
those at Pompeii itself much better than I thought them formerly, & my
impression of the smallness of the houses & narrowness of the streets is
much less than it was. The climate & temperature here both in rainy & in
fine days is deliciously Edition: current; Page: [318] vernal, & my
health is benefitting much by it, being already decidedly better than at
Rome. I have not therefore called on Dr Strange3 but I mean to do so,
knowing no one else with whom to advise about going to Sicily. I have
made no plans yet & shall not think of any till I have letters—If they
do not come soon or if they are not satisfactory I shall set off at once
for home. If otherwise I shall still remain some time here—I have Capri
and Ischia to see & several fine long country walks to take & if today’s
weather holds they will be extremely pleasant—the spring too has
sufficiently commenced to promise good botanizing which I shall begin as
soon as Lucas goes. He seems thoroughly to enjoy this place—while the
Irish papers say that he is on his way back to England “mortified,
exasperated & ready for anything desperate.” I like him much better as a
companion than Pope: he is a man of some instruction & some ability as
well as lively & cheerful & I am sorry he cannot go with me to Sicily as
he would evidently much like to do. I have had no answer from Pope & do
not know whether to direct to him at Nice or not. How the people
die—there is Archdeacon Hare gone now.4 Let us try to live as long as we
can. Adieu my own beloved.

No letters yet! but I am somewhat tranquillized by finding that no
newspapers have arrived in Naples during my absence in consequence of
the stormy weather. It is a sad specimen of the Neapolitan climate—this
is the eighth day I have been here & in all this time there has been
only one afternoon in which it was possible to see the bay—& but for
that afternoon which we spent on Posilipo, Lucas & his friend (unless
tomorrow proves very unlike other days) would have left Naples without
having ever seen it. We went to Salerno on Sunday, the 4th, & put my
last letter in the post there because the Naples post office was not
open that morning. One of the most unpleasant things here is the
impossibility of knowing when the post office or indeed any other place
will or will not be open. Since that, every day has been like a windy &
rainy April day in England, & about the same temperature. We went to
Paestum on Monday & the largest of the three temples was very fine—finer
than I remembered it. The solitude however is quite gone—there are now
in the enceinte of the old walls, several large & many small
buildings—one or two ugly masses called villas—& Edition: current; Page:
[319] the whole of that plain is dotted at intervals with new looking
well to do habitations. When we came to the ford of the Silarus it was
much swollen by the rains & the ferry was declared impracticable for a
carriage, so we walked the remaining five miles & back & I was glad to
be able to do it though I felt quite fatigued before it was done—I am
not however at all worse for it. We did not see the tops of any of the
higher mountains. The day after we went from Salerno to Amalfi by a new
corniche road & though the opposite side of the gulf was invisible, what
we could see was splendidly beautiful: we then returned by the same road
nearly to Salerno & by La Cava to join the railway at Nocera & returned
to Naples by the last train. In the evening the clouds cleared off
partially & shewed the extreme beauty of the valley of La Cava, now
studded with primroses. Today was heavy rain in the forenoon which we
spent at the picture gallery in the Museum. It is a poor collection, not
exceeding except in number our own National Gallery. Titian’s Danæ & the
Venus of Tintoretto have disappeared from it no doubt from the same
motive as the marble Venuses. There are however a few fine pictures
left. There are several Correggio’s much praised, but none which pleased
me. The best point in this gallery is that as at the Louvre a selection
of what are thought the best pictures are collected together in one
room. In the afternoon the weather having cleared a little though still
showery we went to Posilipo & saw the antiquities there of which the
only one worth seeing is a tunnel, considerably longer than the Grotta
di Posilipo, & like that going right through the hill, made by Lucullus2
for his private use & lately discovered & cleared out by the present
King of Naples.3 The only good point I have heard of in this King is
that he has really spent much money in improvements & especially in road
making: the Amalfi road, that to Sorrento & the railways, besides a
carriage road up Vesuvius as far as the Hermitage, & putting in complete
order the four great post roads of the Kingdom, two of these being to
Reggio & Brindisi: Lucas, though he has had such bad weather, is
perfectly delighted with what he has seen & especially with the natural
scenery & so seems his friend to be who is very pleasant &
companionable.

Feb. 9. At last thank heaven I have got your letter of the 28th—one has
been lost, for the last I received was dated the 13th & there is a
number missing. It can scarcely be at the office here, as they have
shewn me every day all they say there are under the letter M. If it was
sent to Rome, & the Edition: current; Page: [320] post office has
neglected to forward it, Lucas has undertaken to make them send it on.
Even this one has been longer on its way than necessary, the Times being
here up to the 2nd of this month. The stormy weather has delayed the
steamboats, three of which arrived today & brought all the papers from
the 26th inclusive. As the last letter which reached me gave a poor
account of your health I have been very anxious—& have not been easy in
my mind the whole time I have been here. Dieu merci all is right & I
will endeavour not to be uneasy again. The papers bring up the news to
the large division against the ministry & their resignation4—a real
misfortune for it is a chance if the next is as good. I think it was
foolish of them to oppose an enquiry—When such accusations are made &
believed, no matter how insufficient the authority, they ought to be
enquired into. And everything practical which is under the management of
the English higher classes is always so grossly mismanaged that one can
quite believe things to be very bad, though not a jot the more because
it is asserted by the Times & its correspondent. How very Times like to
cry out now for Lord Grey5 as war minister after all their attacks on
him in & out of office for incapacity & conceit. I shall think seriously
about the book on Liberty6 since my darling approves of the subject.
Lucas & his friend left early this morning, much delighted with his
visit & said repeatedly that he had seldom enjoyed three weeks as much
as since he met me at Rome. He is really for an Englishman a well
informed man—for every historical fact or Latin quotation I brought out
he had one as good and he has some will & energy, which distinguish him
from nearly everybody now, & talks really intelligently on politics on
which he & I generally agree. Of course a professed Catholic could not
agree with me on much else & I should have talked much more
controversially with him but for the presence of his friend Kyne
latterly whose priesthood imposed a restraint on us both. As I was
Cicerone to them at Naples I of course planned everything with reference
to them—for myself the three days spent in going to Paestum would have
been better passed at Ischia, which now I don’t think I shall see more
of than can be seen from Posilipo. But Paestum was a better recollection
for them to carry away. Yesterday was spent in the Pozzuoli & Baiae
excursion, also, for me, a waste of time: but in returning the afternoon
& evening were delightful & the view of the bay & mountains exquisite. I
have passed the whole of this morning on the hill of Posilipo, going up
& down & round about. As so often happens in such cases, the morning
they left was much the finest morning for staying which had occurred
since they came. Edition: current; Page: [321] I sat on a ruin on the
very top of the very end of the promontory with the blue sea at my feet
(never blue till today) the broad bay of Baiae with Misenum, Procida &
Ischia on the right, Capri & Sorrento on the left, Nisida in front with
the staring prison on the top of it in which poor Poerio still lingers.7
That blot excepted all was the loveliest possible. Coming from Rome here
is completely coming from the enjoyment of art into that of natural
beauty. I enjoy it far more than I expected & it was with the mind only
that I reflected, if there was such a place in England how much more
beautiful the detail would have been made. But there is nothing wanting
to it, seen from this promontory in “the purple noon’s transparent
light”8 for such it was, even though hazier than a fine English day &
though it rained soon after. I have recovered a good deal of the
strength I had lost & walked about from nine till three without being
done up—though after I returned, the second walk to the post office (one
in the early morning having been ineffectual) made me very very tired &
I do not know how fit for walking I shall be tomorrow. If I can I shall
walk tomorrow to the Lake of Agnano & the Solfatarra which I tried hard
to see with Lucas yesterday but there was not time enough & he was
tired. You cannot imagine anything more delightful in climate than
Posilipo today—the near side of the promontory was like, not a cool
summer day but a hot one, short of what one calls excessive heat like
that of last July—the want of sun hitherto has I think kept back
vegetation, but the almond trees are brilliant with flower, there are
single & double camellias in flower in the garden of the Chiaja & the
air was full of the delicious smell of the beanfields—the 9th of June
would be early for them in England, but there is not a difference of
four months in the season—it is that the beans are here sown in autumn
while in England where the frost would kill them they are not sown till
spring. The inaccessible sides of Posilipo are covered with stocks in
flower & with what the Torquay gardener calls a Coronilla, but which I
am convinced is a Cytisus. It is Medicago arborea. I have done with
sightseeing here unless in case of a rainy day. My plan is to take a
long country walk every day while I am here & to go to Sorrento & Capri,
but (unless Dr Strange when I see him says something which alters my
mind) to start for Sicily on the 16th, going Edition: current; Page:
[322] by sea direct to Palermo which the steamboat office promises to do
in 15 hours, the night being included, while to Messina owing to
stoppages at various places on the coast, it takes 26. So if my darling
has written to Messina I shall get it but not for some time—meanwhile
please dearest write to Palermo as I shall return there after the
western tour of the island before I go to Messina, Etna, Catania &
Syracuse. I shall keep this letter open till tomorrow that I may tell
her the result of another weighing (I ought to have gained much, for
though my digestion is still feeble & precarious I feel breathing health
in at every pore) & I shall then take the letter to Rothschild’s9 where
I must go tomorrow for money. I have heard nothing from Pope & do not
know if he has gone to Nice or not. I unfortunately forgot to say
anything to him about medical men & have regretted it ever since. I have
read in the papers about severe frost & snow in England but at that time
it was frosty & cold even at Rome—not at Naples or very slightly. But
since Spezia I have not had one day not decidedly hazy. The people are
very tiresome in one’s walks—every one whether working or idle asks for
money & my ears cannot get quit of the sound of “Signor! piccola moneta”
“Signor! piccola botteglia” (the common phrase here) “Excellenza!
qualche cosa per mangiar maccaroni in questi giorni” (this last phrase
usually by a woman & smiling). They frequently propose to eat my health
in macaroni. All this besides the morto di fame (here pronounced mort’
di fam’) from every ruddy faced chubby urchin in this populous
neighbourhood. At Baiae some boys & girls insisted on dancing what they
said was the tarantella, saying that it was molto curioso; in which
after seeing it I did not agree. Then they positively will not let me go
to the good points of view, for one does not choose to go accompanied
against one’s will by one or more of these people & expected to pay them
for annoying one: I generally refuse to go & afterwards go by some other
way. The cone of Vesuvius owing to subsequent eruptions is more stumpy
than when we were here, but the outline of the mountain is still
exquisite. Here as in all the rest of Italy they say there has been no
wine made these five years & even their ordinaire is brought from
Sicily. Nothing can be more beautiful than this place. You can I dare
say imagine how I enjoy the beauty when I am not looking at it—now in
this bedroom by candlelight I am in a complete nervous state from the
sensation of the beauty I am living among—While I look at it I only seem
to be gathering honey which I savourer the whole time afterwards. I
wonder if anything in Sicily or Greece is finer. Now goodnight darling.
Before going to bed I shall read a little more of another much lauded
book on Italy, Vieusseux,10 who I think Edition: current; Page: [323] is
a still greater donkey, though a trifle less pert & conceited than the
Scotchwoman Mrs Eaton11 I think her name is. He professes to give an
account of Rome but scarcely disguises that he (though a Catholic) found
the whole place a confounded bore. He is a kind of French
Englishman—born in England12 but has lived chiefly in France to very
little purpose.

Feb. 10. A rainy day, though now (two afternoon) with gleams of sunshine
from time to time. No Lago d’Agnano nor country walk of any kind. I went
about the town after breakfast trying to get weighed but could not. I
have since been to Dr Strange, an elderly, sensible sort of man. He
examined my chest with greater care and trouble than any one ever yet
did, not even excepting Clark. He gives a very satisfactory account of
it. He finds no sign whatever of disease on the left side—some little on
the right, & he is not quite sure that there is not a small cavity
there: but, cavity or not, he gave a decided opinion that the disease is
now stationary. The deranged digestion he thought might be owing to the
damp season which he says is deranging everybody’s digestion: at all
events that may have made it slower in being removed. But it is going
away as quickly as I could expect. He says Palermo & Messina & even
Malta are quite as bad as to March winds as Naples: but as I told him
how little susceptible I am to cold or changes of temperature, he
thought I need not mind that. So I am still in the mind to go on the
16th & Palermo will be the place for my darling to write next: but I
think only once, & then to Messina, as the letters take so long coming.
I am very fit for a little walking today but I think a long walk would
have been too much for me. Adieu with the utmost love.

My darling love, I have today accomplished my walk to three of the
ancient craters which, to the number of at least five, are within a walk
of Naples, & my exploration of the woody & mountainous tract (commonly
known as the Phlegraean fields) of which they are a main feature. The
first is the Lake of Agnano, about three quarters of an hour’s walk from
the further end of the Grotta di Posilipo. This is one of the usual lake
craters, surrounded by woody hills—about the size & character of the
Lake of Albano, with the mountain Edition: current; Page: [324] of the
Camaldoli Convent (the highest on this side of Naples) presiding
majestically over it as the Monte Cavo2 does over the other. The next is
the Solfatara, which differs from the others in being still partially in
operation. The footpath to it from the Lake of Agnano, fortunately a
back way which avoids all teaze from Ciceroni & beggars, winds up to a
great height, on the outside of the hill or mountain the hollow of which
forms the crater, which outside however though bushy is white & yellow
from the alum & sulphur which rather form part of the soil than exude
from it. This brought me to the very highest point, overlooking Posilipo
& all the hills about, to Vesuvius & the mountains of Sorrento & on the
other side the Ischia & Cuma district, with the Solfatara deep below. It
is a well marked crater, only broken down at one point, towards
Pozzuoli, &, from the height, looks (or rather about half of it looks)
like a plain of very uneven white sand. On getting down to it however I
found it studded every here & there with smoking holes, one of which
dipping under a sort of cliff, letting out huge volumes of
sulphurous-smelling opaque vapour, & all encrusted about with sulphur of
every shade of colour & variety of texture, large enough too to seem the
entrance of a cave, really looked as if it might be one of the wicket
entrances to the infernal regions—very like one described in the
Pilgrim’s Progress.3 At several places in this platform there are works
for extracting alum & sulphur from the soil & vapour, but as it was
Sunday & the people were not there I could not see the process. I then
reascended the opposite side of the crater & wound up a much higher
ridge than the other to look down from the very summit into the third
crater, that of Astroni which cannot be entered without a special
permission; being kept as a park & hunting ground by the King of Naples,
who is said to have filled it with deer & wild boars but I saw none:
this is far the finest of the three, being a perfect crater, unbroken
except where a little cutting has been made about half way up for an
entry—treble the size & double the depth of the others, a wild open
forest of ilex with two or three ponds instead of one great lake. There
is a wall built all round the rim of the crater, but in very many places
it can be Edition: current; Page: [325] seen over. As a detail this is
far the most beautiful thing I have seen here. I should like to look
over that wall every day of my life: I walked about half round it, then
returned to Naples by the Lake of Agnano. I did not intend to go to the
Grotta del Cane which I knew was hereabouts, but finding myself close to
it I went, & I am glad I did, for even in things of this sort I find
seeing is a very different thing from reading about them. I would not
let them put the dog in, though the little fellow came trotting up as if
he was quite used to being temporarily killed. A lighted torch was
enough for me, & it did go out with an instantaneousness which I did not
expect. The so called Grotta is about the size of a good sized closet,
though how far the substructions go I know not. They pushed some of the
gas towards me for me to taste & the taste & smell were pleasant—exactly
like some artificial Seltzer water which I had drank yesterday. Strange
that what is so pleasant in the stomach should be so fatal in the lungs.
But there is another quite as curious cave close by, which I had never
heard of & which is not in Murray though discovered the man said 24
years ago—this is the Grotta ammoniaca in which the exhalation of
ammonia when I stooped to about half my height almost knocked me down
with the shock. It was like the very strongest sal volatile. There are
also some ruined buildings supposed to have been baths, in the different
rooms of which hot vapour full of sulphuretted hydrogen comes out of the
hill side as copiously as water from a spring & coats everything with
saltpetre & flowers of sulphur. I enjoyed this walk greatly, though it
was a cloudy watery looking day, & gave none of the fine effects of
light—Vesuvius however was clear all day & the Sorrento mountains
towards afternoon. I have perhaps been doing great injustice to Tuscany,
for Naples hitherto has been worse: it has had nothing southern but the
delightful temperature. But even so the beauty is a perpetual feast. I
am not caring at all for pictures & statues now—natural beauty engrosses
all the capacity I have of that sort—not that my enjoyment of the others
was not as real, & very nearly as great, but because one sort of
excitement of this set of faculties is as much as I can take in at once.
As I was nearly seven hours doing this, steady walking with much
climbing, & only occasional sitting down, & do not feel overdone this
evening, I may consider myself to have got back nearly my former
strength. On Sundays all the shops are shut here as well as at Rome; but
the people amuse themselves; the young men in holiday dresses were
playing at bowls in a dozen places. All this day (perhaps because it was
an unfrequented path) everybody told me the way & nobody asked for
anything except one man who fairly earned by his information the half
carlino I gave him. But the custodi are, in every sense, impayables.
There was one for each of the caves & another for the baths. The fellow
at the Grotta del Cane demanded six carlini before letting me in, but as
I positively refused to give more than two & proceeded to walk off I got
in for two & could Edition: current; Page: [326] probably have got in
for one if I had stood out for it. I could hardly tear myself from this
place if I did not reflect that we are much more likely to come here
some other time than to go to Sicily—unless indeed, par impossible, we
go to live there. I meant to go to Capri tomorrow by the weekly
steamboat which goes & returns every Monday, but the sea is too rough—I
should probably be sick & it is a chance if the Grotta Azzurra would be
accessible. I have only once seen the bay smooth. There has been a
strong wind from the sea ever since I came, the only wind from which the
bay is not sheltered. I shall scarcely see Capri now unless it be in
returning from Sicily—a boat from Sorrento even if the weather improves
would probably be too expensive. There is little chance even of a fine
enough day for the view from the Camaldoli, said to be one of the finest
things here.

Sorrento, Feb. 12. Here I am darling & at the same inn,4 La Sirena which
looks as pretty as possible; only I think we were not on the ground
floor which I am now. By the bye I only ascertained today, by finding
the number of the house in Mrs Starke, that my inn at Naples, the Hotel
des Etrangers, is the very Casa Brizzi which we were in, though not then
called a hotel. Being in a totally different part of the house & the
entrances of all the houses being so much alike I only gradually
recognized it, or rather suspected it. I came by the railway to
Castellamare—it was pleasant to see such a neat town in this part of the
world. The road here you know as far as Vico—the remaining new part is
still more beautiful, as it goes round the mountain at a greater height.
The first half of the road across the plain of Sorrento has been
considerably widened, at the expense of the orange gardens; & the new
wall on one or both sides of the road is not nearly so high as before:
but the latter half is the same odd sort of lane it was formerly. In the
streets of Sorrento itself I do not think two carriages of ordinary
width could pass. It is all very beautiful though the day is damp, &
here rather cold: this side of the promontory is always much colder than
Naples. Sorrento is a summer residence & there seems absolutely nobody
in the house—& the book testifies that there have not been above a dozen
persons this year. The host or rather hosts, the brothers Gargiulo5 (one
of whom Murray says was a servant of Mrs Starke) have this inn & two
other shewy ones in the place—therefore they must have thriven, but (if
the waiter is to be believed) not since 1848: he says people pass the
winter in Naples, go to Rome for Easter & then go home while this place
depends on those who return after Easter. He complains also of the war &
the cholera, which last however has spared Sorrento Edition: current;
Page: [327] itself. In any case I shall have a day or two’s walking &
botanizing here, & if the sea continues as rough, I shall not hurry to
Sicily—not from fear of shipwreck, but of seasickness. I was weighed
this morning, having prevailed on the English groceress Mrs Stanford to
make shift to weigh me. My weight was 73 rotoli all but three ounces—but
the oddity is that authorities do not agree about what a rotolo is.
Murray says it is 1¾ lb English: if so I have lost weight even since
Rome, which is so very improbable that I set this down among Murray’s
many unpardonable errors. Mrs Starke says it is two ounces more, 31 oz
which makes me a gainer of eight ounces6 in the last fortnight. Mrs
Stanford says she always calculates a rotolo at 2 lb English; & the
Frenchwoman at the library says it is 33 French ounces, a kilogramme
being 36, or 11/12 of a kilogramme, which as a kilo is rather more than
11/10 of two English pounds makes a rotolo equal to 2 lbs at least: if
so I have regained within three pounds of the 15 lbs I had lost. Mrs
Starke is the most likely to be right & even on her shewing I am doing
very well. I have had to buy some of Mrs Stanford’s tea, though most of
my own is still unused—but I shall have need of it all in Sicily.

Feb. 13. Out today from half past nine till five. I have recovered all
my strength. How pleasant, once more, after 3½ hours’ walking, much of
it climbing, to find myself at the foot of a very steep & rather high
mountain & not to feel that I had rather not climb it. I did so, & when
I had got to the top was not at all tired—& scarcely tired when I got
back to the inn, three hours after. The mountain in question was the
Punta della Campanella, a promontory of Minerva, occupying the extreme
end of the Peninsula of Sorrento. Even when I had got half way up I
hesitated about going on, because the clouds which had never quite left
the top during all this dull morning, seemed just then to be thickening
& coming lower down: but the sky seemed to lighten a little— & before I
got quite to the top all was clear. I sheltered myself partially by the
little chapel from a wind that threatened to blow me down; not over the
precipice, for it came the opposite way, from the south. Though not very
clearly or brightly I did see the whole of the Bay of Naples one way &
the Gulf of Salerno the other, & even part of the coast of Calabria
beyond the Gulf. I staid nearly half an hour watching the clouds draw
off Capri, Vesuvius & St Angelo, the highest mountain of this peninsula,
higher I believe than Vesuvius—& found it difficult to go away, as the
scene grew more & more beautiful every five minutes. But I had a
delightful walk back, seeing for some time both bays— & indeed more, for
I could see the mountains of the south side of the bay of Gaeta—&
afterwards only the bay of Edition: current; Page: [328] Naples but this
more & more clearly the whole time. But my darling must not suppose that
even then I saw the bay as it is at its best—as we saw it long ago. When
I see how very lovely it is now I should much regret not seeing it as I
saw Spezia if I did not hope to see either it or Sicily & Greece in
finer weather. Though the air is never clear nor the lights the right
thing, there are yet two colours very perfect. Vesuvius this evening was
a splendid purple & St Angelo a fine lilac, which last was the
prevailing colour the evening of my return from Baiae. There has been
but one fine morning, that on which Lucas left, which I passed on
Posilipo, but it generally grows more or less fine about two in the
afternoon. As far as I can judge at present, if we lived in Italy,
Castellamare would be the desirable place. It is itself one of the most
beautiful points of the coast, near all the most beautiful—it is a
possible summer residence since even Naples is so & this is cooler.
Murray says 8 degrees cooler by day & 10 or 12 at night. It has twelve
mineral springs, chalybeate, saline & sulphureous—& for convenience it
is an hour from Naples by railway, the fare by first class being 1s.8d.
by second 1s.2d. Thereby hangs a tale. I did not suppose that the
general roguery of Neapolitans in money matters extended to the railway,
so took the word of the man who gave the tickets for the
fare—accordingly he made us pay, to Pompeii, & again back, first class
fare for second class tickets. Having informed myself since I tendered
the right sum for Castellamare & got my ticket without parley. I shall
not get to Capri—the people here say it would be impossible to get into
the Grotta with this sea. The wind is higher than ever & though it blows
off this shore & makes in this part of the bay no surf, one can see the
waves rolling outwards, an unusual sight—& the south wind is as contrary
as the west for going to Sicily. I dread sickness, for though my
strength has returned I still digest but indifferently—it is true my
appetite is so great here that I eat twice as much as I do at home—&
though it is only of the most digestible things I perhaps ought to eat
less—but while I gain flesh & strength I must be doing well. I shall put
this letter in the post here—it saves time, as I shall probably stay
here another whole day & when I get to Naples the day after, may find
the post office closed. This backward country is the only one in Italy
where one cannot prepay by stamps. They profess to send even unpaid
letters by the steamboat though not by land; but Rothschild’s people
profess to be very sceptical about their really going. My last letter
which went through Rothschild I dare say went safe: I hope you received
the one before which though dated Naples was put into the post at
Salerno. Tell me darling in your next letter whether she has received
all mine. The extreme beauty of this country makes me independent of a
companion—I do not long for a companion, but for my darling. A companion
however would be a convenience by rendering things practicable which
would now be too Edition: current; Page: [329] expensive—among others
going to Reggio by voiture. The time it takes—ten days—is another strong
objection—the bad inns another, but I do not much mind that, as I can
take macaroni & cook it myself, & make tea (without milk). Adieu
darling. How long I fear it will be before I get another sweet letter.

Feb. 14. Man proposes but the devil disposes. First & foremost there is
actually no post office at Sorrento. Letters are entrusted to the
boatman who conducts the market boat to Naples early in the morning &
who may perhaps put the letters in the box, but I should expect, pockets
the money with which he is entrusted to pay them—Secondly—I decided to
remain another day at this dear inn (the first by the way in all this
journey in which I have had damp firewood) because the walks are so
splendid: this morning looked unpromising, but I climbed the heights &
had got half way down the Scaricatojo when the rains set in so seriously
that after taking shelter twice as I best could I had to return to the
inn. I just saw enough to know of what a glorious view I had been
deprived. Yet I must go back to Naples tomorrow or I shall lose the
steamer for Sicily—where it is quite time to go if I do go. It is
tiresome to come to Naples for weather like a very wet summer in
England. I shall keep this letter open now to Naples & probably send it
by Rothschild. If I go on the 16th or 17th I shall write next from
Palermo—if I do not, I shall write again from Naples. I am very well
after yesterday’s walk. Addio angela mia.

Naples, Feb. 15. A stormy day, with frequent rain & hail—the wind
changed back to the west & violent. It was not however so bad in the
early part of the day as to prevent me from walking to Castellamare,
with a mule (like our donka formerly) to carry my portmanteau. The walk
was pleasant but the wind almost blew me away. The bay of Naples about
whose freedom from storms so much has been written, was raging like the
bay of Biscay, & magnificent spray dashing over the coast road though
raised many feet above it. There seems no prospect of this ceasing & I
have given up all hope of immediately going to Sicily. On arriving I
found another bottle of cod liver oil broken (no doubt by a fall from
the mule) & more mischief done to books & linen than before. The linen I
have sent to be washed—the books there is no help for—& as misfortunes
never come single, a third bottle burst, I suppose from being put on the
mantle shelf. I have now but two left, one of them empty. Happily the
one I had left of Allen’s is the survivor. I suppose I must wait here
for better weather. This would be no displeasure were it not that it is
becoming thoroughly rainy & stormy weather. It seems as if the house
would blow down. Adieu my own precious love.

You see my own love that my letters fall naturally into the journal form
whenever there is something doing every day & a quiet evening to note it
down. The consequence is a good deal of repetition & surplusage &
diffuseness, but she has the things fresh & fresh, & she knows what I do
every day, which is very pleasant to me to think of. Today, darling, was
a fine & even a calm day after the storm of yesterday & of the evening &
night—& I thought I should not have a finer day for the Camaldoli, so I
walked there. It is as I mentioned the highest summit on the north side
of Naples.—The ridge on which part of Naples stands (& the first
prolongation of which, covered with houses, is called the Vomero, from a
supposed resemblance to the shape of a plough) rises gradually to this
height crowned with the convent. It is the only place from which there
is a panorama of the whole neighbourhood—the Sorrento mountains, those
of La Cava, Vesuvius, the Apennines, & the mountains all round the bay
of Gaeta. All these could be seen clearly today except those on the
north side of the bay of Gaeta which the hazy state of the air made
indistinct. The plain of Campania looked very strange in the bright
sun—one uniform level of leafless trees, with which all the arable land
of the Neapolitan territory is clothed, the vines growing on the trees &
the crops of corn, beans, & lupins under them. On the other side were
Ischia, Capri, &c & the Phlegraean fields—Astroni like a huge round
bowl, & Posilipo like a tiny ridge raised by a child. The very steep
side of the Camaldoli mountain towards the Lake of Agnano & the sea is
covered with low wood, chiefly chestnuts, & through this I returned to
Naples passing through the Grotta, making a walk of five hours besides
much previous walking in the town itself. I called again on Strange—who
by the bye refused to take a fee this second time, which has never
happened to me before with any medical man. His opinion of the state of
my lungs is very favorable—& after hearing what I had to tell him
respecting my little susceptibility to cold, & that dry air has always
agreed with me best, he saw no objection to my remaining in Sicily
through March; on the contrary he thought that Rome, which is not good
for the digestion, though better for the lungs than Sicily, was on the
whole in my state not so good a place for me. This entirely agrees with
my own feeling—my digestion, always good at Blackheath, began already to
suffer at Torquay; & at Pisa & Rome it got better very slowly, while
Edition: current; Page: [331] here from the very first evening there was
a marked change for the better & my strength soon came back altogether.
Lucas felt the same—he had never digested well at Rome, but felt better
as soon as he arrived here. And Sicily in Strange’s opinion belongs to
the class of climates like this & not like Rome or Pisa or Torquay but,
as he says, like Brighton, which you know always put me in health
directly. If I should find the winds in Sicily bad for me either by cold
or dryness, Strange advises me to return not to Rome but to Sorrento, of
which climate he has a very high opinion—& told me a wonderful history
of a patient of his who after going uselessly to Madeira came with half
his lungs actually gone, but got so well at Sorrento that he is now
living in England a robust man. With this encouragement to remain in
Sicily I do not feel so eager to go there directly & instead of going
tomorrow (17th) I now think of going on the 20th when I hope the weather
will have calmed down still more completely. In the meantime I think of
going to Ischia.—I shall write this evening to Hill, who will be
expecting to hear from me by this time. He has shewn, all through, great
interest in my health. To my surprise, Peacock at last shewed or
professed some, & pressed me to write to him if ever so little, so I
suppose I must write a few lines to him from Sicily or Greece.

Feb. 17. No Ischia, for the steamers are always changing their day, &
the one which was to go today not having yet arrived from Marseilles its
departure for Palermo has been put off to the 19th & of course none will
go on the 20th. I shall therefore go the day after tomorrow & there is
no time to go to Ischia first. The sea is getting smoother & I shall
have a good chance of a calm voyage. This journalizing gives you all my
changes of purpose of which you see dearest there are not a few. Being a
little tired with the much walking lately I went no further today than
Posilipo. After ascending the drive I walked quite along the top of the
hill to the village which is exactly over the Grotta—looking towards the
Camaldoli, Astroni &c. with the increased interest produced by my now
intimate knowledge of them. On this north side of the ridge, (as well as
yesterday in the fields below it) I found the beanfields not only not in
flower, but nipped (as well as many other things) by recent frosts. The
temperature however today was that of a delightful English summer. The
weather began heavy and ended very fine. There is a fresh arrival of
newspapers today, the only one for nearly a week: containing the new
ministry. Palmerston will now either make or mar his reputation—much
will be expected from him & he will be ambitious of being remembered as
the Lord Chatham2 of this war. I was glad to see Ld J. Russell, even at
this Edition: current; Page: [332] late hour, hoping that Lord Raglan
would disregard the “ribald press”3—pity he never said so till he had
felt the ribaldry of the Times against himself in its grossest form. I
perceive by incidental mention that the newspaper stamp is to be given
up4—also that the government are to bring in a bill for limited
liability in partnerships. My dearest one knows that I am not prone to
crying out “I did it”5 but I really think my evidence did this—for
although there are many others on the same side, yet there would but for
me have been a great overbalance of political economy authority against
it—besides I have nowhere seen the objections effectually answered
except in that evidence. We have got a power of which we must try to
make a good use during the few years of life we have left. The more I
think of the plan of a volume on Liberty, the more likely it seems to me
that it will be read & make a sensation. The title itself with any known
name to it would sell an edition. We must cram into it as much as
possible of what we wish not to leave unsaid.—I have been reading here,
for want of another book, Macaulay’s Essays. He is quite a strange
specimen of a man of abilities who has not even one of the ideas or
impressions characteristic of this century & which will be identified
with it by history—except, strangely enough, in mere literature. In
poetry he belongs to the new school, & the best passage I have met with
in the book is one of wonderful (for him) admiring appreciation of
Shelley.6 But in politics, ethics, philosophy, even history, of which he
knows superficially very much—he has not a single thought of either
German or French origin, & that is saying enough. He is what all
cockneys are, an intellectual dwarf, rounded off & stunted, full grown
broad & short, without a germ or principle of further growth in his
whole being. Nevertheless I think he feels rightly (what little he does
feel, as my father would say) & I feel in more charity with him than I
have sometimes done, & I do so the more, since Lucas told me that he has
heart disease, & is told by his physician that whenever he speaks in the
H. of Commons is at the hazard of falling dead.—I now hope that my
Salerno letter arrived, but fear that it arrived late—for a note to Dr
Deakin which I put into the post at the same time & place (the morning
of the 5th) was not delivered till the 12th & I have only got his answer
today. My note was merely to ask him to change his steel prescription
made up with acid, for one without acid, as the acid disagrees with
me—which he has done.—I shall send this letter from Naples but not, like
the last two, through Rothschild—there is nothing very precious in it, &
Rothschild demands such an enormous sum for postage that he must make no
little profit by this branch of business—though Edition: current; Page:
[333] his managing man is very anxious to impress that he loses by it &
only carries it on to oblige foreigners. Lying, even without much
apparent motive, is so thoroughly the habit of this country (Naples)
that it seems to be in the very air, & one finds it where one does not
expect.

Feb. 18th. Another change in the steamboat—it came in so late that it
will not be ready to go tomorrow nor perhaps even next day—so I might
have gone to Ischia—but I cannot now, for there is no counting even on
its unpunctuality. But the weekly boat goes tomorrow for Capri returning
the same day & I am inclined to go by it. Today the weather is, not like
a mild but a very hot summer day—oppressively hot whenever the wind is
not blowing directly towards one. I have been out for another round in
the Phlegræan fields, almost entirely different from the last. I went
round the right side of the Lake of Agnano instead of the left side as
before—climbed the woody side of the crater on the right side of
Astroni—got into a region of defiles & chestnut woods—made a great
circuit including the crater of Monte Barbaro, got to Pozzuoli by the
Street of the Tombs—a complete necropolis of columbaria in very good
preservation—took a country carriage from Pozzuoli to Naples (costing
1s.4d) in which I was more shaken than I ever was before in my life.
This curious region is literally nothing but craters—whenever you are
not on a ridge you are in a bowl, & every ridge is circular. The
subterraneous fires seem to have found so many vents that the craters
press against one another like cells in a honeycomb. The variety &
beauty of the woods, mountains & ravines is wonderful—there are points
where from the disposition of the foreground Monte Barbaro seems as high
as Mont Blanc—from the ridges the great view is continually stealing
in—& on the descent to Pozzuoli the bay & even the usually ugly town
looked quite heavenly. As I reentered Naples the whole mile & a half (as
I suppose it to be) of the Chiaja was as crowded with carriages as Hyde
Park in the season—& at the same hour, too, five oclock. Almost all
seemed Italians but none looked like what we call the higher classes—I
suppose it is that the higher classes here look exactly like all the
other classes, & that is, I must say, very mean. Except the lowest
class, whose look of perfect freedom, & sans gêne without any of the
externals of rudeness or grossness, makes them much more distingué than
their superiors. The merry look of all classes of the people is
pleasant—even the soldiers, a party of whom today were dancing in the
middle of the road to castanets beaten by one of themselves. And they
always look round to invite the passerby to take part in their mirth
which I always do by looks & often by words, difficult as it is for us
to understand each other when neither can talk decent Italian. Whatever
may once have been true about the idleness of Neapolitans, nothing of it
is true now—they beg, but they also work, & when at work, do it with a
will. I have not sought Edition: current; Page: [334] to talk politics
with anyone & have only once got into conversation on any political
subject—this was with a tradesman, who groans over the state of
things—longs for help from England, France, or anywhere—as an Italian,
is proud of Piedmont but envies it for having as he fancied the
guarantee of England7—& was most anxious to have it known in England
that the Neapolitans are not to blame, for they could do no more than be
cut to pieces which many of them were. He asked me how things go on in
the Crimea, as they are not, he said, suffered to know anything—To shew
the ombrageux disposition of the government, he said that when Prince
Napoleon8 passed through this place, every shopkeeper whose shop he had
entered was put under the surveillance of the police.—The country is
covered now with spring flowers, except the woods in which there are
next to none. Walking in them is otherwise like what it is in England in
the very hot days one sometimes has near the end of April while the
trees are still leafless. These are quite leafless still, but that is
because they are chestnuts. It is pleasant to see orange trees loaded
with fruit of the height of stone pines. The children everywhere play at
ball with oranges. This hot day I wished that I durst eat some.

Feb. 19. I am not destined to go to Capri. Thinking the sea smooth
enough I got up & breakfasted an hour earlier than usual & walked down
to the port where I found that the sea is too high for getting into the
Grotta Azzurra & that therefore the steamboat does not go. I walked out
& botanized (rather successfully) about Pozzuoli—this & reading at the
reading room took up the day. The steamer for Palermo is really fixed
for two oclock tomorrow—but I have not much faith in it. I shall not be
sure till I have made fresh enquiry tomorrow morning—& on my way back if
I am really going tomorrow I shall post this letter, so she will know if
she gets it with no further addition, that I really went on the 20th. I
shall write very speedily from Palermo. Adieu mine own.

Feb. 20. I reopen this to say that I have just been weighed again & have
gained in eight days half a rotolo & three ounces, about 1¼ lb
English9—If the people here are right this is within a pound of what I
weighed at Avignon. Even according to Mrs Starke it is 3 lbs more than
when I left London. Adieu again my angel.

Palermo

Feb. 22 [1855]

[30]

At last darling I write to you from this place when a little while ago I
hardly thought I should ever arrive. I am well rewarded for running the
hazard. By good luck the day I started though a dull & finally a rainy
day, was the very first since I have been at Naples on which the sea was
really calm. I had a very favorable passage: starting at nominal two,
really half past three, & having been honestly told at the (Sardinian)
boat office that it took 18 or 19 hours according to weather, I found
myself to my surprise in Palermo harbour before 8 in the morning when I
was looking forward to two or three more hours of suffering. The sea was
so calm that there was hardly any perceptible motion at all, which
however did not prevent me from being sick, though not so desperately
sick as last time: but the misery after I landed was even greater, &
lasted many hours. However this one day has almost paid me for it. The
essential is that it has not upset my digestion as it seemed to do
before: I have had indigestion since, but not very badly & though I felt
weak today the weakness partly went off with walking. This place is not
much like what I expected. I thought it would be, for Sicily, flat; but
it is shut in by a complete amphitheatre of mountains, about the height
apparently of those about Nice or rather higher, & as close to the town.
The mountains are most beautiful especially one with a conical top
(Monte Cuccio) which on nearer approach resolves itself into a mitre,
with two minor peaks like shoulders. This is not the Monte
Pellegrino—that, which nearly touches the town, is an insulated
mountain, close to the bay, & with a Vega all round the rest of its
base. It forms indeed one horn of the bay, which is very open i.e. long
in proportion to breadth. This is the roughest outline. I hardly think
you will make out what I mean by it.

[lf0223-14_figure_002.jpg]

Then as to the town—I expected to find it very formal & regular, with
fine buildings, & rather dull. It is not regular at all, except that two
long strait streets intersect each other at right angles in the middle:
the others are as irregular as in any other southern town. There are no
fine buildings, architecturally; Edition: current; Page: [336] very few
that pretend to be: very few handsome houses (this very handsome inn
being one of the best) indeed there can hardly be fine houses where all
is worn & washed off stucco or paint. But it is the liveliest, gayest
most dancing about place, like no other Italian town, but like a good
second class French town, & every part of it smelling of cookery which
considering that it was Ash Wednesday shews that Catholicism is
liberally interpreted. Perhaps this is because it is the only place in
Europe where the clergy have lost none of their property. Then I fancied
the Marina a quay like those at Paris except in being less commercial.
Instead of this it is a promenade, very short, very broad, & something
like what the Mall of St James’s Park would be if the sea was where the
inclosed garden is. The houses are in a row like Carlton House Terrace,
with a real raised terrace: underneath is a single avenue of trees, then
a very broad promenade for carriages, then a raised trottoir, then the
sea—One of the tallest of the houses (which are all irregular & in that
respect unlike Carlton Terrace) is this Trinacria hotel, & from my
window au quatrième I look down on this & on the perfectly tranquil
sea—& whenever I like to go out on a balcony on the other side of the
passage I see over the roofs of the city the lovely outline of the
mountains. These mountains though bare & rocky shew a soft green on
almost every part; whether this is cultivation I shall presently find
out. One of the first things I found here was that during this whole
month of rain at Naples the weather here has been so unseasonably dry as
to threaten short crops: a scirocco which has dried everything up. & the
morning I arrived the first that had been un poco fresco. Certainly
anything more perfect than the weather of these two days could not be
desired. The warmest summer sun with light summer breezes—the trees
indeed not in leaf, though some of them are beginning to be so & the
elms are many of them quite green but on coming near, one finds it is
with seed, not leaves. The public garden splendid with tulips &
daffodils, the narcissuses over; & in the first country walk, what
cartloads of plants! the country in a blaze with them like the chalk
hills in June, more than half of them new to me; some twenty acres of
asphodels in brilliant flower. I had only the embarras des richesses &
had to buy today twelve more quires of paper. The sky a fine blue, but
chequered pleasantly with light clouds, & not at all hazy: only however
like a clear day in England. I suppose the so called Italian sky, unless
it is only a South of France sky, is to be found only with the
Tramontana2 & not when the wind is from the sea. With our Tramontana in
March we often have a very bright sky. On the whole I prefer a sky like
today’s. But the heat is sufficient to make me not dislike the idea of a
cold wind next month when the sun will be still hotter.—Yesterday just
before I went out I wrote my name in the inn book, & the moment I came
in, the Edition: current; Page: [337] waiter gave me the card of the
consul Mr Goodwin.3 I thought, here is an old gossip who is on the qui
vive for all English to find somebody to chatter to. I went this morning
early to leave my card in return, meaning to take no further step but to
wait to see what he would do next: but it so chanced that the only
person I could find in his office was himself. So I was in for it, & had
a long chat. He is the chatterbox I supposed but his talk with me was
all on interesting subjects, chiefly Sicily & its people—he had read he
said some of my writings, which I doubt but he had certainly heard of me
from Senior whom he has seen here, & I soon found that he meditated
writing a book on Sicily4 & had got together materials with great pains
& apparently care—& though elderly & lame, jumped about on his crutch
with the agility of a boy to fetch all sorts of manuscripts & tables to
display to me. I am inclined to think from the indications I saw, that
his facts are to be as much depended on as such facts almost ever are &
I learnt much from him. To begin with what interests us personally, he
says that living is not cheap here—on account of the very heavy taxes,
especially octroi, which as he calculated (& he shewed me his figures)
are fully £1 per head of the population of this poor country & the mode
of levying many of them still worse. Houserent is very high: his house
(he called it a house, not rooms) costs him £90 a year: the rooms seem
very good, but he says he should pay in Tuscany just about half as much
for similar accommodation. The people he says have no dislike to
foreigners, & like the English (I suppose because they have seen little
of them); they dislike only the French, which dislike he thinks is
traditional, & dates from the Sicilian Vespers:5 not improbable, among a
backward people. They are also the only Italians whom the French have
never governed, & who have nothing to thank the French for: they were
the beginners of improvement everywhere else & it is worse for Sicily
not to have had them. Yet (to shew how far European ideas reach) even
Sicily has had ever since 1812 the French law of succession, only so far
modified that the father may dispose by will of one half instead of only
a child’s share. Accordingly many of the great estates are being broken
up, to the great advantage of the people as this man sees & says, though
he timidly added that he did not know how it would operate ultimately. I
made particular enquiries about the tenure of land: most of it he says
is not metayer6 as it is in Italy generally, but held at a quit rent, so
that the cultivators are virtually proprietors. From his facts I
gathered that they are pretty well off, Edition: current; Page: [338]
though he thinks they are deteriorating, because as he says improvement
does not advance & population does. The only improvement he could speak
of was a new adjustment of the land tax lately made which he thinks very
beneficial: He says the Neapolitans are as much encamped here as the
Turks in Europe—they are regarded as foreigners & there are 30,000
troops in Sicily to keep the island down: among whom the only ones whom
the Government trusts are the Swiss (I hear soldiers jabbering German
everywhere). The Naples Govt therefore grudges everything to Sicily &
lays out nothing in roads or anything else. The Sicilians want England
to take Sicily but Goodwin tells them no, England has colonies enough
already. He says every tenth man you meet in the streets is either a
priest or a placeman & the number of idle people dangling in hopes of a
place (if even one which they can barely live by) is enormous. He says
the government publishes nothing which they think discloses anything
disagreeable, but they did publish a classified return of those who died
of cholera & among these, after almost every mode of recognized
occupation was enumerated, those returned as of no profession or regular
occupation were in the ratio of 24 per cent of the male population.
There do not appear to be many vagrants & he thinks these are in great
part people supported in idleness by their families, waiting for
something. He told me a great deal very interesting about agriculture &
other occupations. He says there are much fewer English mercantile
houses here than formerly, & he supposes much less business done, owing
greatly to the anti free trade policy of the government. I asked him if
he knew anybody who wanted to make a tour in the island as I should be
glad of a companion: he did not, but this evening I had a note from him
telling me he hears there is a Mr Travers Cox7 in this inn who is in
that predicament & wants a companion: how one sees in everything the man
who rushes to tell every word he hears & ask every question. The note
also invited me to tea tomorrow to meet two or three of the resident
English. I saw he meditated an invitation & am glad it is not to dinner.
It confirms me in the belief I already had that he is not married, for
as Lord Shaftesbury8 would say, a man is by nature incapable of giving a
dinner party: It seems I have no chance of seeing a newspaper here
unless by Goodwin’s means—the landlord here, Ragusa (the one to whom
Leslie Melville9 gave me a letter & who seemed extremely delighted &
flattered thereby) told me that there is no reading room, no circulating
library of any kind, & nobody but Goodwin who takes Galignani, but
Goodwin he says has a splendid library. I am thrown on my own books
Edition: current; Page: [339] & have begun reading Goethe’s Italian
travels10 which I had in Italy formerly & read—I like them much better
now—he relates impressions in so very lively a manner & they seem to me
to be all true impressions—he went, too, a learner in art, & I find many
of his feelings at first very like mine. I forgot, though bringing
German books, to bring a German dictionary, but I get on tolerably
without one. I have also Theocritus,11 a proper book for Sicily. I judge
that of the remaining few months of my time, six weeks cannot be better
spent than in this island—which will leave about time for a glance at
Greece & returning home. I feel no doubt about Greece now—the
seasickness I can bear, my only fear was that it would cost me all the
health & strength I had gained but about this I now feel at ease, for
the passage from Brindisi to Corfu is considerably shorter than from
Naples here. Only, if I have time enough, I shall return to Naples by
Reggio & the Calabrian route which will take at most ten days from
Reggio. I wish more than I can express that my darling was here to see
the beauty & enjoy the exquisite climate. Goodwin says they never suffer
from heat except in July & August, & even then there is every day a
northern sea breeze from nine o’clock till four. If so it must be the
finest climate in the world: such a February & no hotter summer. Messina
he says is cold in winter & no other place in Sicily fit to live in.
Certainly I have never yet been in a place where existence was such a
pleasure. I want nothing here but my one want—but what a want! only here
it is the want to share enjoyment, not the want of wanting enjoyment: as
in all the journey till Rome, of which even the pleasantest parts, were
vanity & vexation of spirit. Pleasure began at Rome, increased at
Naples, & is still greater here—& will continue so if I either go alone
or if Mr Travers Cox turns out well. I am half inclined to go alone, but
the great saving in expense is a solid consideration which turns the
scale.

Feb. 24. morning. Yesterday morning having been a little feverish in the
night & not having slept the latter part of it I saw the dawn from my
window. This house, & the Marina generally, do not look north as I had
supposed, but considerably more east than north, so that even at this
season the sun comes in for near two hours after sunrise. I saw the
fishing boats going out in the twilight—they are small boats mostly
managed by one man, but have a South Sea look, the head being bent round
& prolonged into a high peak. You must imagine this a sea like
Brighton—no ships are visible—there are Edition: current; Page: [340] a
few in a corner, not to be seen from the Marina, but so few & small that
you hardly notice them—the minute amount of commerce for the capital of
so large & naturally rich an island is ridiculous. Both yesterday
morning & this, at six oclock before it was quite light a regiment of
infantry marched along the Marina with the band in full play—Invalids
here have no chance of a morning slumber. There is in the next room to
mine a poor Frenchman, a Prince de Beautremont,12 whose cough is painful
to hear. I started about nine to climb Mount Pellegrino: I went round
the harbour & bay & found the mountain not close to the bay as I fancied
but a mile or a mile & a half from it. You know all about this mountain
& the cave of Santa Rosalia,13—the daughter of one of the Norman Kings
who retired to this cave & whose body is preserved in the same cave
turned into a chapel—she being the patron saint of the place there are
abundant pilgrimages & the grand fête & procession once a
year—consequently there is a broad made road though not a carriage road,
to the chapel, nearly two thirds of the way up—this road winds across &
across one of the bends or coombs of the mountains & then sweeps round
it to a sort of elevated plain among the tops, of which there are two or
three smaller & one much higher principal summit—I made the ascent in
company of a flock of goats one of several which were climbing & climb
daily to this high level where there is a little green—on the side of
the mountain there is hardly green enough for even goats to feed—it is
all grey rock, in small scattered blocks, without even bushes but with
many flowering plants. I chattered with the young men & boys who tended
the goats, as much as their & my ignorance of Italian permitted: they
were astonished & amused as the people all about are at my botanizing,
but always seem to understand when I say it is per curiosità & are
troublesome with their eagerness to get plants for me in hopes of a few
grani. The chapel of Sta Rosalia is in a corner of the bit of table
land. There is a front to it like a small church, but when you enter
there is the grotta—not like most things so called an ugly cellar or
vault, but a spacious Robinson Crusoe cave such as one imagines, & in it
a splendid spring, not rising but dropping from the rocks.—In a semi
subterraneous receptacle, is the marble statue of the saint, clothed in
a robe of gold (as they say)—at least a tablet in the church
commemorates that a King of Naples had it made at an expense of 2000
scudi. I climbed afterwards to the summit where is a telegraph tower &
two soldiers (one of them also a tailor) to manage it. The views all the
way up had been very fine but from the top was one of the most glorious
I should think in the world. Edition: current; Page: [341] The whole
north coast of Sicily (all mountain & bay) as far as the eye could
reach, the sea studded with the little round Lipari islands, the larger
island of Ustica farther west, the exquisite Vega of Palermo & the town
itself spread out as in one of the bird’s eye Panoramas, the
amphitheatre of mountains round it—Before I had reached the top I had
caught the first view of Etna, which I thought I recognized in a white
dome like object that rose through & above the white clouds—& when I
reached the top, the soldiers confirmed this. The day was the most
perfect of summer days, the wind light & easterly, just sufficient to
temper the sun’s heat—the soldiers called it scirocco di levante, to
distinguish it I suppose from the real African scirocco—Goodwin calls it
the vento Greco. After enjoying the view for some time I started down
the mountain. It was 12 when I was at the top & it took an hour & a half
to reach the foot. I certainly never at any time of my life could have
first climbed & then descended this mountain more vigorous & fresh. I
feel equal to climbing Etna itself if this were the season for it. When
I got to the inn I was not even tired, except indeed my arms with the
weight of plants I carried, to the edification & amidst the apostrophes
of the public—who were full of questions & remarks—the most
complimentary of which was one I overheard, one woman having given a
shout of astonishment (all speaking here by the common people is
shouting) when another quietly remarked to her that it was for my bella
& was a galanteria. I wish indeed it had been for my bella, & a day
never passes when I do not wish to bring flowers home to her. You see by
this how beautiful the flowers are: this time, besides some lovely blue
flowers, there were some noble specimens of the tall yellow asphodel of
our gardens, which grew quite comfortably out of the rocks of Pellegrino
& were gathered for me by an enterprising goatherd. On entering the town
I was actually stopped at the octroi—I was asked what those were:
“plants” I said—“what do they serve for?” “per sciente”. what did I
bring them for? “for curiosity”—“there was nothing doganale”—they were
quite satisfied & dismissed me with the pleased animated look & voice
which everybody here has on every occasion. When I got to the inn, the
old fellow had been there with a carriage to take me out! lucky I missed
him—soon after, a card with the corner turned down from a Mr Villiers
Meynell14—I could not at first conceive who this could be—but at last
concluded that it is one better known as Frederic Villiers whom I knew a
little, long ago, no connection of the Clarendon family but as I
remember being told, a natural Edition: current; Page: [342] son of a
man named Meynell, & who I suppose has now taken his father’s name. He
then was or professed to be a great crony of the two Bulwers15—who were
not yet known & celebrated—it was before the publication of Pelham.16
This man & Charles Villiers17 who were at Cambridge at the same time
were called savage Villiers & civil Villiers—it is the same man who was
returned for Sudbury with Dyce Sombre18 & turned out for bribery,
whereby the borough got disfranchised. I did not like the man formerly,
& expect I should like him less now, so I shall return his call only
after a due interval—At eight oclock I proceeded to Goodwin’s, two doors
off—there were as I expected no women—but three or four English
mercantile people, of much about the knowledge, range of ideas &
cultivation which one expects from such—what that is I need not say—but
Goodwin was a sun among these minor luminaries. They confirmed what he
said about the people, that all classes of them like foreigners, (&
English) rather than otherwise, & make things pleasant for them, but
none of them spoke so well of the climate as Goodwin—they said it was
very hot [for] three months but admitted that those who live in the
Marina or anywhere by the seaside do not feel it, unless indeed there is
scirocco when you must shut all doors & windows fast. It seems to be an
almost Australian hot wind.—Generally one finds bad weather everywhere &
is told that it is an extraordinarily bad season—here all say it is
extraordinarily fine—quite a remarkable winter, & things a month more
forward than usual. The weather certainly is perfect, or rather was, for
I fear the long postponed rain is to come now: there is an evident
change coming today. I am pursued everywhere by bad weather. I found
this old fellow Goodwin had made an engagement for me again for this
evening to an American named Gardner19—I thought it was quite time to
stop this, so I excused myself, expressing dislike to going out in the
evening & readiness to call on his friend in the morning, which
accordingly is to be done today. Mr Travers Cox I find has a wife with
him, but has a half inclination to make a visit to the ruins leaving her
here. Already (though not personally known to Goodwin) he had heard of
my projects (though I had not said a word of them to the landlord or
anyone at the inn) & like a sensible person, wishing I suppose to see if
he should like me or not asked the host to place him next to me at the
table d’hôte—but as I don’t dine there, this did not take effect. (N.B.
I always pay less than the price of the table d’hôte.) I doubt much if
any stranger Englishman will value my beaux yeux & interesting society
sufficiently to tolerate the vagaries of a botanist & for my own part I
find the Edition: current; Page: [343] plants society enough. A note
came from an anonymous Englishman in the inn to know if I was a member
of the University Club & a brother of the late Professor Mill20 of
Cambridge. O these English! the gossiping gossip hunting of English
living idly at a place like this. I must be off to the post, for this is
post day—always irregular here, depending on the steamboats. Adieu with
a thousand thousand loves.

As soon as I had put letter 30 in the post, I called on Goodwin by
engagement, & was quite relieved by finding that on second thoughts, it
seemed to him that as it was post day some other morning would do better
for calling on his friend. It appeared he had engaged me (conditionally
as he called it) to Villiers Meynell for this evening & wanted me to
dine with him (Goodwin) one day & drink tea another but I excused myself
from going out in the evenings at all. Of his today’s civilities I
accepted two—one was the transfer to me of a place he was offered but
cannot make use of to see the procession tomorrow. There is to be
tomorrow & all next week a grand celebration of the Immaculate
Conception2—I have found this already over at all the other places but
here I have exactly hit on it & every effort is being made to have it on
the greatest scale possible. The place offered is at the house of a Sr
Bordonaro3 who Goodwin says is a great merchant & just returned from
England: he, & his, probably are worth going to see. The other thing
Goodwin did for me was to give me a reading of a whole week’s
Galignani’s arrived this morning. It is not quite the fault of the
Palermo people that they have no reading room—there was a Casino where
the papers were taken; but after the revolution, though all the members
who were considered liberals (among the rest Goodwin) retired, the
others were told that they might have a Casino on the ground floor where
the police could have its eye always on them, but must not have one au
premier. By the bye when I landed they asked me all the questions which
are said to be asked at Vienna of people going to Hungary: where I was
going to live, what my object was, & if I knew anybody at Palermo: if I
had said yes, the next question would have Edition: current; Page: [344]
been: Whom? It pained me to read of the terrible frost & snow in England
(as well as at Paris) to think that she has had that to bear, while I
was in a perfect summer temperature, for even at Naples it was the
weather of summer though of a wet summer. I quite respond to what Goethe
says, that he would gladly leave to the Italians everything else if only
he could (like Dido) inclose a piece of climate as large as an ox hide
cut into strips would go round, & place that exactly round his home.4
There seems little other news. What a clever & judicious hit of
Palmerston, sending Russell to Vienna.5 I went out for my walk as usual,
but the rain which I foresaw, came on by degrees & became quite settled,
but light mild rain. It will do much good to the country & thus far has
done no harm to me. The country even so looked beautiful. There is a
singular feature both in the town & environs which struck me from the
first—you every now & then come to what seems an old pillar or obelisk,
from 12 to 20 feet high, occasionally reaching 30 or more—In the streets
this always accompanies a fountain: in the surrounding country also
water often gushes from it a little above the bottom, or half way up;
sometimes you see no water but only hear it inside. Of course I knew
that the water must be brought there in pipes & as the things all looked
like old ruins I was not surprised to hear from Goodwin that they were
made by the Saracens. Everything done in Sicily since the time of the
Greeks seems to be their work—they drained this city, in consequence
probably of which it only lost 1 in 33 by cholera when Messina lost 1 in
3 or 4: & they made these water works—the water is brought in earthen
(i.e. tiled) channels from the mountains & rises to the tops of these
pillars which are furnished with a small reservoir & from this the water
is carried in pipes to the fields surrounding each—especially the orange
gardens. Goodwin says it is calculated that every Sicilian orange sold
in London has absorbed a hogshead of this water. The Saracens did the
same at Valencia & Grenada but I did not know how it was done. A great
article of cultivation here is a kind of sumach—a great deal of the
country is laid out in it; the first leaves are gathered, dried &
squeezed into powder & sent to England to be used in calico printing:
the second crop of leaves with the young twigs are crushed in the same
way & sent for tannery purposes to England. This however is said to
exhaust the soil & cannot be kept up more than a few years. The cactus
is a great feature Edition: current; Page: [345] in this country: there
are two kinds, one prickly, the other not, or much less so: this last
grows wild all about. They grow with a thick trunk like a middling sized
olive of which the branches are cactuses & when they are planted close
together to form a hedge they so interlace that it would be as easy
getting through a brick wall. These cactuses are grown for their fruit
which is said to be excellent. Palermo is I think about the size of
Rouen. The public offices differ from all other houses (except this inn)
in as much as they look as if they had been whitewashed or painted
lately. The others seem as if they had never been so treated since they
were first built, & the more you see of them the more utter defiance you
perceive of all attempt at any sort of appearance; but indeed how can a
place look well when all the ground floors are uninhabitable, given up
(where not to shops) to the poorest people who dry their clothes in the
courtyards. What is called a Piazza here is an immense open space, left
to nature, seldom even levelled, & with the ugly sides of all the houses
turned towards it—I mean in appearance, for in reality those worst sides
are their best sides. It reminds me of nothing so much as of the open
spaces made in London when a quantity of houses have been pulled down to
make a new street. Of course with the obvious differences of say climate
& people. Buildings private or public which aim at architecture, (these
are chiefly in the outskirts) generally however aim at neatness too.
Their architecture is generally of the Moresco6 type, at least it
resembles my notion of such—colour reddish or red yellow: the forms
mainly squares, arranged side by side & one upon an other—the detail
(especially the windows), a kind of fantastic variety of Tuscan Gothic.
The Cathedral has quaint square towers large & small on different parts
of its roof, but such effect as they & its Moresco rectangular front
might have is taken away by the unsuitable excrescence of a dome stuck
between them—these paltry ugly domes all like one another, which are the
universal type of a church at Rome, Naples, all their dependencies &
here, have given me a complete distaste for the stile.—These travels of
Goethe give me a number of curious feelings. I had no idea that he was
so young & unformed on matters of art when he went to Italy. But what
strikes me most in this & in him is the grand effort of his life to make
himself a Greek. He laboured at it with all his might & seemed to have a
chance of succeeding—all his standards of taste & judgment were
Greek:—his idol was symmetry: anything either in outward objects or in
characters which was great & incomplete, or disproportioned (exorbitant
as Balzac says of a visage d’artiste)7 gave him a cold shudder—he had a
sort of contemptuous dislike for the northern church architecture, but I
was amused (& amazed too) at this most characteristic touch—that even
Greek, when it is the Greek of Palmyra, is on too gigantic a scale for
him; he must have something little & perfect, & is delighted that a
Greek Edition: current; Page: [346] temple he saw at Assisi8 was of that
& not the other monstrous kind. He judged human character in exactly the
same way. With all this he never could succeed in putting symmetry into
any of his own writings, except very short ones—shewing the utter
impossibility for a modern, with all the good will in the world, to
tightlace himself into the dimensions of an ancient. Every modern
thinker has so much wider a horizon, & there is so much deeper a soil
accumulated on the surface of human nature by the ploughings it has
undergone & the growths it has produced, of which soil every writer or
artist of any talent turns up more or less even in spite of himself—in
short the moderns have vastly more material to reduce to order than the
ancients dreamt of & the secret of harmonizing it all has not yet been
discovered—it is too soon by a century or two to attempt either
symmetrical productions in art or symmetrical characters. We all need to
be blacksmiths or ballet dancers with good stout arms or legs, useful to
do what we have got to do, & useful to fight with at times—we cannot be
Apollos & Venuses just yet.

Feb. 25. A thorough rainy day: & I should not have gone out had I not
thought it might be unpolite to Mr Bordonaro not to make use of the
favour he had conferred on me: I therefore made myself spruce & sent for
a carriage, the people here never telling me that there was to be no
procession. When I arrived I had to learn from Bordonaro himself that in
Sicily they can do what in France & England is deemed impossible, viz.
to put off the eclipse.9 It is certainly a more sensible plan than to
have an eclipse in a rainy day when nobody can see it. There was not
even high mass at the Cathedral, for in expectation of the fête they had
had the usual services all early in the morning (even vespers as a
priest told me). I did not find this out till I had been in the
cathedral some time. It is but poor inside, though large. Each of the
side aisles is roofed with a succession of small domes, which luckily
cannot be seen from without. I think the priests must feel very safe
here, or they never would allow confession to be made so ridiculous as
it is in this cathedral. The confessionals, of which there is one to
every pillar of the nave & I believe of the transept, are made like
large baby’s chairs, open not only in front (except just at the bottom)
but nearly half way down the sides: & the places where the penitents
kneel are quite outside, in the open church. In these half open sides of
the chair in which the priest sits, there is a little Edition: current;
Page: [347] grating to which the penitent’s mouth is applied on one side
& the priest’s ear on the other, the whole being in full public view. In
the only one which I saw occupied, it was the priest’s turn to speak, &
the penitent, a woman, was applying her ear outside & the priest talking
into it through the drilled holes of what I improperly called a grating;
he jabbered most volubly in so loud a voice that if I had chosen to
listen I could have heard every word he said. It was as if two children
in a room held up a small sieve between them & affected to converse
through it. I suppose that with southern literalness they think
absolution is absolution & that no decencies need be observed, & after
all the child’s play of the grating is not more unmeaning than most of
their other forms.—The rain continued all day—it is good fortune amidst
bad, that with so much rain as I have had this is the first entire day I
have lost from weather. I stayed in my pleasant room reading—among other
things the first idyll of Theocritus, which is very sweet & melodious. I
read also part of a book by a Professor in the University here, on
Palermo & its neighbourhood.10 He says that there are some years in
which there is no scirocco in summer at all, that it often lasts all day
but never more than three days & that very rarely: that while it relaxes
healthy people it revives weakly ones but that to the astonishment of
everybody, when the English were here during the war,11 many of them
“dressed in cloth” walked about in the sun during the scirocco & liked
it—he supposes it gave a pleasant stir to their nerves, & acted on their
“robust constitutions” as a gentle zephyr does on Sicilians. The average
number of rainy days in the year is, he says, 64, & of days in which
rain falls more or less, 131. So it is by no means a dry climate, & to
my consternation I find March is the rainiest month except December. By
his account the thermometer at Palermo never, in ordinary years, sinks
quite to the freezing point. It is singular that he uses English feet &
inches & the English thermometer. Snow however falls, not very seldom,
but of course does not lie in the town. The rain yesterday & today is
evidently caused by the east wind which set in the day before, when I
climbed the Pellegrino—not that it is a wet wind, but the change of a
wind which has blown long, with fine weather, brings rain here as it
does everywhere else. I felt it colder before the rain came—& it is now
cold enough to require a fire in the evening—I wanted one too to dry the
papers of my plants, as in this damp air, spreading them out is not
sufficient. The plants, what with determining new ones, & changing &
drying the papers, take up several hours in every 24.—I have been
thinking darling that when I get back I should like to reprint a
selection from the review articles &c.12 It Edition: current; Page:
[348] seems desirable to do it in our lifetime, for I fancy we cannot
prevent other people from doing it when we are dead, & if anybody did so
they would print a heap of trash which one would disown: now if we do
it, we can exclude what we should not choose to republish, & nobody
would think of reprinting what the writer had purposely rejected. Then
the chance of the name selling them is as great as it is ever likely to
be—the collection would probably be a good deal reviewed, for anybody
thinks he can review a miscellaneous collection but few a treatise on
logic or political economy—Above all, it is not at all desirable to come
before the public with two books nearly together, so if not done now it
cannot be done till some time after the volume on Liberty—but by that
time, I hope there will be a volume ready of much better Essays, or
something as good: In fact I hope to publish some volume almost annually
for the next few years if I live as long—& I should like to get this
reprint, if it is to be done at all, off my hands during the few months
after I return in which India house business being in arrear will
prevent me from settling properly to the new book. Will my dearest one
think about this & tell me what her judgment & also what her feeling is.

Feb. 26. The day of the gradual & very slow clearing off of the rainy
weather. There has been but an occasional ray of sunshine & now & then a
little rain, & though the weather seemed to improve by degrees, I am not
even now sure that it will be fine tomorrow. I walked to Morreale
[sic],13 a little old town directly inland from Palermo, a little way up
the rocky mountain & overlooking the principal of the passages into or
through the mountains—which, with a rather broad entrance, seems to
contract rapidly beyond this place. In entering this town I walked into
the rain, which even so short a way up the mountain had not ceased,
though Pellegrino & the mountains near the two horns of the bay had long
been clear. The wind had changed to west, & the very wet looking clouds
which covered the mountains south from Palermo seemed to thin away as
they blew over towards the bay. At Morreale I saw a convent of
Benedictines which shews what convents were in the days of their
grandeur—splendid long galleries with pictures, magnificent cloisters &
the reverend fathers sleek & neatly dressed. There is also a cathedral
here, much older I should think than that of Palermo & certainly much
finer—in which some of the old Norman Kings of Sicily are buried—the
interior is mostly covered with very old gilding & very old quaint &
naif mosaics from the Old Testament with an enormous Christ in Mosaic in
the apsis like that of Pisa—altogether in the dark stile of St Mark’s at
Venice, though the chapels are decked out with the richest & finest
marbles. This church looks better than usual from outside, especially
from a distance, as you ascend the mountain side towards the town. But
as a general rule, no south Italian Edition: current; Page: [349]
church, scarcely even any at Rome, is fine outside. Architects have
never found out any new means of making a mere wall other than ugly—to
have done so is the triumph of the real Gothic church architecture. When
that stile is departed from, architects feel obliged to stick in
unmeaning columns in order not to have a dead wall. They do not do that
here, & the few ornaments they have invented do not, any more than the
little square holes they call windows, give life or beauty to the wall.
It remains a mere wall after all they can do & besides they let these
walls get shabby like their houses—by the stucco peeling off. The view
from Morreale must be splendid in fine weather. The rocky mountain side
above the town & road, is covered & hid with cactuses: it is these with
their broad flat oval dish like leaves which make the mountains look
green from a distance. The fruit, Indian figs as it is called, is sold
along the road side—it has a red pulp something like that of a real fig,
full of seeds, sweet, but without much flavour. Looking down again from
the road, you see below you not the soil but the tops of orange trees,
out of which, as out of long grass, rise occasional olives & some taller
leafless trees looking like walnuts, with an occasional cherry tree in
full flower. I made a detour westward to return by a country road
instead of the long suburb of Palermo which the mud rendered almost
impassable. The plants accumulate at a rate quite frightful: today I
brought in a bit of an aloe in flower. The fête is to be on Thursday,
the first of March: I suppose if the weather is fine.

Feb. 27. It is fine & pleasant this morning darling, though still too
cloudy—but the return of the feeling of fine weather does me so much
good—& Pellegrino from my window looks so very very beautiful through
this soft light. I shall have a delightful walk. As this is post day I
shall begin by putting this letter into the post. I fear there will
hardly be one for me yet. What a happiness it will be to have one again.
I so long for that dear handwriting—it is of no use longing for that
dear presence. A thousand blessings & loves to my darling of darlings.
How scratched this letter is with corrections—but I write everything at
first just as it comes & it is as awkwardly expressed as it is when I
speak.

This has been a day of pleasure. In the first place when I took my
letter to the post I received hers of the 15th—& happy I was to see the
dear handwriting after being so long without it. I hope hereafter that
my localities will Edition: current; Page: [350] not be made uncertain
as they have been hitherto by health. I do not wonder that my dear one
has been ill with such dreadful cold. How much I hope that it has by
this time ceased. It seems so strange to read of everything being buried
up in ice when it requires an effort to me to believe that it is not
June—the country covered with flowers, the temperature perfect summer,
the corn as high as it is with us in the middle of May—the almond trees
covered with green leaves & with rather large young almonds. However all
here say that it is a much warmer than average season.—As I went out
this morning I was told that Goodwin had just left a message that the
procession2 was fixed for today. He had told me yesterday that it was
fixed for Thursday March 1st & now I did not feel at all inclined to go,
my mind being set on a walk in the fresh fine weather after the rain. So
I saw no more of the show than could be seen in going to & from the post
office—viz. two carriages of senators, exactly like the lord mayor’s
coach—& the streets heavy with as much finery as could be procured. In
many of the side streets they had hung across, & along side, on ropes,
their chemises & petticoats, which I seriously believe they did in honor
of the fête. Having seen thus much I turned my back upon the Maria
Immacolata & my face towards an old convent at the foot of the mountains
south east from Palermo, called Sta Maria di Gesù. The only thing it is
celebrated for is the view—but I did not stop to consider the view from
the foot of the mountain, preferring to climb the mountain itself—which
I did, among bushes & a profusion of splendid flowers to a considerable
height, when I got among cultivation & took a footpath along the top of
a sort of ridge or shelf—to a point at the extremity of one line of
mountain, looking direct towards the sea. Here I sat for about half an
hour & then made a circuit back to the town. The day grew finer every
hour & at last appeared quite like settled weather. The town shewed more
finely than from any other point & the combination of sunlight clouds
mountain sea & the fine plain (which looked its largest from here)
produced such a variety of beautiful effects as no words can give any
idea of. In the evening the town was illuminated & I determined to see
what it was like. It was finer than I expected. The principal street a
mile long, called here also Strada Toledo, in which every house has
balconies to every story (whereof there are three four or five—the
uppermost very often a nunnery, with grated balconies), made a fine
effect by its long vista when lamps (a sort of lanterns but very bright)
were ranged all along all these balconies. Some few people tried
festoons & a few had lanterns of coloured paper or little lamps of
coloured glass but on the whole there was little attempt at variety and
the effect was all the better. The cathedral was lighted along all its
prominent lines & round the dome & several of the towers, but nothing
like St Peter’s. A splendid moon looked down upon it all from a clear
blue sky, & seemed to think all Edition: current; Page: [351] this
artificial imitation of her light very unnecessary. I had two unexpected
treats: one was, I found the door of the Jesuits’ convent open & I
walked in, to the square courtyard or cloisters which, seen by
moonlight, is a thing to dream of—the most exquisitely light columns
supporting the cloisters, & other columns above exactly similar
supporting a second quadrangle of open loggie—like nothing I ever saw
elsewhere. The other treat was, some most beautiful music by the band of
one of the Swiss regiments, in the Place of the vice regal palace. The
principal clarinet, who led, was a player quite fit for the
Philharmonic—& the execution altogether was perfect—most of the music
also very beautiful. You may judge of the enormous size of this very
ugly Place when I say that there was another much louder military band
playing at intervals in another part of the same Place & that it did not
interfere with the effect—it was scarcely audible. These Swiss soldiers
with some of whom I got into talk, all conversed with one another in
French—most of them seem to be from the Valais, some however are said to
be fresh from the Forest Cantons—some from Vaud. I have been speaking to
Ragusa3 about a tour of the island, or rather the western part of it,
which is all I mean to do from here. He advises me not to take a guide
but simply a muleteer (who will do just as well) with two mules, & says
that it will cost only three piastres a day including nourriture which
the muleteer provides, it being necessary to take much of it from
Palermo—If I took a guide it would cost five dollars—the dinner indeed
would be on a much grander scale but this I do not want: Since it is to
cost no more than between 12 & 13 shillings a day for travelling &
feeding, which is much less than I expected, I am very glad I have not
shackled myself with any companion, which besides would hardly have
diminished the expense, since two persons would have required two
muleteers & perhaps two pair of mules as well as two breakfasts &
dinners. I am not at all eager to leave this place, but I think it is
time to be moving. Ragusa requires two days notice, one day for engaging
the muleteer & another for the muleteer to engage the provisions—but
notice tomorrow morning will enable me to start on Friday the 2d which,
if the weather tomorrow is as fine as it promises, I have decided to do.

Feb. 28. A most lovely morning with blue sky & sea. Goodwin sent early
to propose to me a drive out with him: this agreed well with my plans,
for as I leave this place so soon I intended to devote this morning to
what I had not seen of the town. So I went to Goodwin (who lives only
two doors off) to say yes, & as I told him I should call on Meynell
today he proposed to go with me. I gave Ragusa authority to engage mules
for Friday & then went to the University where there are said to be fine
sculptures & pictures, but the place was shut: it will be open however
tomorrow. I then passed the Edition: current; Page: [352] greater part
of the time until Goodwin’s hour (one) in seeing churches, of which
there are three or four much finer & some nearly as large as the
cathedral—especially one (St Joseph) with enormous antique marble
columns. I saw no pictures of consequence—the church where the best
pictures are was not open—but I had seen at Morreale two reckoned fine
specimens of a painter of great local celebrity, known as Il Morrealese4
& thought them fine—they were like no other painter’s stile & while the
figures were mostly fine & well grouped they all seemed portraits, which
I take to be a merit. I then went to the English banker’s for money—the
partner (named Thomas)5 whose brother I had met at Goodwin’s & who was
very polite with his offers of service, shewed good reason for some
alteration in my plans. My idea was to return from Girgenti to Palermo &
then go to Messina by the coast road, by which Bartlett6 said there was
a diligence—but it seems there is not: the only diligence goes first to
Catania, through the middle of the island. Therefore my best plan is to
go first to Catania too, go from there to Syracuse, & to Messina last:
but also as the road from Palermo to Catania goes full half way from
Palermo towards Girgenti (that being also a circuitous route) my best
plan will be not to return to Palermo at all, but to go from Girgenti
either to join the diligence or straight to Catania by voiture which can
be got at Girgenti. By this I shall save much distance & a good deal of
expense without seeing less of the interesting part of the country. I
calculate darling that there will be quite time for her to write me to
Messina after she gets this letter. The next after that should be to
Naples. Goodwin took me to several places, among others to a house
called Belmonte,7 built by a principe of that title—now belonging to one
of the exiles—rented at one time by Lord Shrewsbury. It has an English
shrubbery in the Torquay stile—but the beauty is in the situation—it is
on a projecting point of Pellegrino, the grounds reach to a place where
they are stopped by the precipitous side of the mountain—& from this
place the bay, the plain & the mountains display themselves in
perfection. The wind had changed again to north east, but it had done
its work in producing rain & this time it only made dense clouds
floating about the summits of the highest inland mountains—Towards the
sea on the contrary there was a clearness & purity in the air which I
have not before seen even here, & the mountains beyond Cape Zaffarano
(the eastern horn of the bay) had those delightful tints which one sees
in pictures but seldom in nature. The sky was of a most perfect blue,
like the blue of little openings Edition: current; Page: [353] in summer
clouds with us. Goodwin improves on acquaintance: he really has
knowledge & reading—he has read a great deal of Bentham & my father’s
India8 with real profit, for he repeatedly cited, as things which had
struck him, what are really their best & therefore extremely unhacknied
thoughts. We called on Meynell—who lives with a wife & child in good but
modest rooms in the top of a house in one of the suburbs. He has been
living here a year & a half, as he says for his wife’s health who had
found Madeira (where he first went with her) too relaxing. This climate
she finds suits her very well but he dislikes the place very much on
account as he professes of the people—the gentry that is—of whom he says
that he could not have believed that Europe contained at this date a set
of people so ignorant & so incapable of being made to understand
anything they do not know, or anything like an argument—The Portuguese
he says are far superior to them. I reminded him that the Portuguese had
now had for many years free institutions & a free press: He said the
higher classes here bitterly regret the breaking up of entails & make
that & the introduction of the Code Napoleon (almost the only good
things the government has done) their main grievances. This does not
square well with what Goodwin told me, that the power which the present
law (now in force a whole generation) gives of creating a majorat of a
certain amount to be attached to a title, has only been used, I think he
said in two instances, & one of these is by an Englishwoman, Lady
Bridport, who has succeeded to some of the Bronte property.9 The Code
Napoleon unfortunately does not mean cheap or speedy justice, for there
are lawsuits which have been pending for many lives—& the stages of
appeal are endless, the government favouring law expenses because a part
of its revenues comes from law taxes. I don’t trust the post office here
sufficiently to write such stories as I have heard about persons in
office but one thing I will say—I hear nothing but the highest eulogiums
on the leaders in the revolution,10 who did not even accept the salaries
of office, & are now in exile without carrying with them anything—though
like all persons out of favour, they are the subject of a thousand
calumnies. There is a new public drive, now more frequented than the
Marina, which was made during the revolution & a jardin anglais has been
made on both sides of it since—but the road itself has not been
continued according to the design, but ends abruptly in a common country
road.—I see from the balcony behind the Edition: current; Page: [354]
house that the town is illuminated again tonight—I suppose it is to last
through the whole octave.

March 1st. Such an exquisite sunrise over Cape Zaffarano! & such a sky
all the morning! with only clouds enough to make the variety agreeable.
I went to the University—there are some fine pictures but none of the
first rank—several by Morrealese, by the same hand evidently but not so
fine as those I had seen. The metopes from Selinuntium are overpraised &
are rather curious than fine—but there are about a dozen antique statues
of which fully half are quite first rate—especially a colossal statue of
Julius Caesar, the only fine one of him I ever saw except one at
Naples—& the first which gave me a feeling of the majesty of the man. I
paid my farewell visit to Goodwin. He told me (in answer to my question)
that Meynell pays £30 a year for his rooms which are very pleasantly
situated but at the top of the house, & rather smaller than we should
like. He gave me a letter to the Vice Consul at Girgenti11 & one to a Mr
Ingham,12 the chief of the greatest wine making establishment at
Marsala—I did not want them but if I find it too troublesome to use them
he evidently will not be offended. The present price fixed by authority
for beef & veal I see, is from 2 carlini 6 grains to 3c. 2g for beef, &
to 3c. 4g for veal the rotolo: the highest price being for filet. This
is for the highest about 7d a pound, dear for such indifferent beef as
it was the only time I have tried it. Here I have never been able to get
anything but chicken: not liking veal or pork which are the things they
propose. I start at six tomorrow morning so I must put this into the
post today & shall take a walk afterwards. I am sure to get a letter at
Messina if written within a day or two. And now adieu my own perfect. I
expect such a fortnight’s journey for beauty & interest as I never had
in my life before—& as much pleasure as I can have separated from her.

Yesterday afternoon my dearest one I took my last walk at Palermo—it was
in an easterly direction; between the sea & the foot of the mountain
which I partly climbed on the day of the fête. The sea was like a strong
solution Edition: current; Page: [355] of indigo; & as smooth almost as
glass; & the colours of the mountains were quite above my power of
description. The illumination & ringing of bells went on just the same
in the evening, but I went no further towards it than the balcony behind
the house. I am obliged in the mule travelling to limit luggage as much
as possible, therefore the larger portmanteau with all that I can spare
is left in the care of Ragusa2 to send to Messina by the weekly steamer.
His charge for my two meals a day plus the simple, is 14 carlins, rather
under five shillings. This cannot be said to be cheap. The room is 6
carlins, the same price as at Naples, and a much better room.—This
morning I started with two mules & a pleasant muleteer. Though it is a
coasting journey the road goes at first directly inland, through
Morreale, the reason of which is shewn by the map—to cut off the
mountainous peninsula or promontory north west of Palermo—accordingly we
left the highest of the Palermo mountains. The beautiful cone I formerly
mentioned (called Monte Cuccio) to our right, & passing up the hollow
overlooked by Morreale (or rather along the hillside which bounds it)
saw that this hollow becomes completely mountainous though spreading out
rather wide above, but with no level space below. After winding up to a
considerable height we reached a pass & then descended a regular
mountain defile, uncultivated & rocky, with a torrent far below us in
the hollow—& soon came in sight of the great bay or bight, of north
western Sicily, bounded on one side by the mountains we were leaving, on
the other by mountains equally high, projecting to a great length into
the sea. As we advanced we saw below us, between the sea & the
mountains, an apparently quite level & highly cultivated plain, with the
town of Partenico in the midst of it looking like those beautiful towns
in Lear’s Calabria.3 It looked poor & shabby enough however when we came
to it. The day was fine but not so clear as yesterday, the wind having
again changed to west or northwest & there were on a few of the highest
mountains clouds which did not dissipate entirely the whole day. I began
to be uneasy as to my prospects. I found mule riding, instead of a rest
from walking, such a fatigue as I think I never had in my life. I rode
to Morreale, then walked some miles, then rode again for a mile or so &
was absolutely obliged to get down & walk the rest of the way, & arrived
at Partenico completely knocked up. This was the midday stopping place.
The only thing the muleteer & I could contrive was that I should seat
myself on the luggage mule, as he had done a good part of the way, he
taking my place on the other. This did better, but I found that the
mule’s walk rivalled everything I ever read of the disagreeableness of
the camel’s. Of the remaining 14 Sicilian miles I rode in this way about
ten, then walked the last four, but arrived so excessively Edition:
current; Page: [356] fatigued that I feel as if it would be days before
I could walk again. Alcamo is in the same plain, or rather on a hill
overlooking it, & you do not find out that it is on a hill till you have
nearly arrived. The plain is bounded as I said on the east & west by
high mountains, but on the south side, in the direction of the breadth
of the bay, the heights mostly are gentler & cultivated to the top: some
insulated bold mountains being interspersed, among others one rather
high peak just above Alcamo, with a convent at the top. The name Alcamo,
like so many other Sicilian words, is of course Moorish, & reminds me of
Aydi mi Alhama. This however is pronounced with the accent on the first
syllable. The plain, of stiff clay (which also overlies the calcareous
rock at Palermo & even on the sides of some of the mountains) seems very
fertile & is richly cultivated: among the rest vines abound: &
occasionally a kind of ash which is much grown in Sicily & produces the
manna of commerce. The approach to Alcamo is across a wide stretching
hollow bounded by slopes without a single tree, all open & of a rich
green with the young corn. On the way I saw several fields of lupins in
full flower—a profusion of plum trees in full flower (chiefly in the
upper hollow ascending from the plain of Palermo) & whenever there was a
hedge (of anything but cactus or aloes) it was in full leaf. The aloes
here as at Nice are somewhat of a delusion, being generally ragged &
shabby about their base, but when this does not happen to be the case,
they are most beautiful. I found my muleteer pretty much of the same
politics as myself but (in his case) turning chiefly on taxation, the
excess of which is certainly one of the great evils of this government.
Bread for instance pays as he said three times; first on the land, next
on the grinding, last on entering the town; & so of other things.—The
inn at Alcamo is as good as to rooms & beds as the inns of the humbler
class of French country towns, & there is capital milk—for provisions in
general however my dependence is on the muleteer, who has provided
everything which Ragusa has told him I eat—& I have my own tea, & made
by the muleteer’s aid as to hot water, a splendid pot of it (he has even
brought a teapot). It will be an incomparable excursion if only I am
able to go on with it, by taking the shortest day’s journeys compatible
with decent sleeping places. But even my seat on the luggage makes me
unfit for walking through stiffness & fatigue—& I cannot walk the whole
journey, & indeed this day has probably knocked me up for walking, for
some time to come. My digestion has unluckily got wrong again—or rather
wronger, for it had never got anything like right. I eat nothing but the
wholesomest things, but I fancy I have been eating too much of them.
Nous verrons.

March 3. Calatafime.4 The room & bed at Alcamo were very clean, the room
a large one, with a bed in each of the four corners, the bedstead
consisting Edition: current; Page: [357] of boards laid on iron trestles
so that they did not look secure from falling down: the only defect I
experienced was that I could not keep the clothes on. But I had very
little sleep, from the impossibility of finding any position suitable to
my aching limbs, & I got up hardly able to move. At breakfast I had my
first experience (except once merely for trial) of the bread of the
country. This is made of the hard wheat, of which nothing in England is
made except biscuit; but it is the only kind of which they make macaroni
& the bread has like that a slight tinge of yellow. It looks very much
of the texture of biscuit, & has very little taste, but when toasted is
like a kind of cake. Either it or the quantity I eat of it disagreed
with me: it does not turn sour like the other bread, but feels heavy &
uncomfortable with a slight tendency to sickness. I made myself as
little uneasy as I could on the baggage mule till we reached the object
of today’s journey, Segesta. The way to it was across the same sort of
country as the last few miles before Alcamo: the rocks only appearing in
the form of scattered & distant high mountains, or occasional upper
parts of the principal heights in what if those upper parts were taken
away would be a very rolling country as the Americans would say & is now
of a lively green with the young corn. We got into a narrower tract of
this as we approached Segesta. The temple, if such it be (for it is
rather thought to be a Basilica, from the absence of all trace of that
part of a temple which contained the altar) is seen for many miles
round, where hills do not intercept; it is on a small platform on the
ascent of a mountain & is seen to great advantage across a hollow, with
a background of rocky mountain & a foreground of fine broken ground,
partly cultivated & partly waste. It is extremely fine, quite equal to
anything at Paestum—& has been very judiciously kept in repair so that
nothing is wanting but the roof: the quadrangle of Doric columns with
the pediments before & behind are complete (though with little vestige
of cornice & none of frieze) & the columns are not so stumpy, & do not
taper with the extreme rapidity of those at Paestum. The ground too
within is perfectly level, green, & disencumbered of rubbish, which to
me is a great improvement. I then ascended to near the top of a height
facing the temple, where is a theatre, with the form & the steps almost
perfect—of such however I have seen too many to care about them, but the
perfection of this was in the view. The Greeks seem always to have had
their theatres (which were not circles but semicircles) with a fine view
when possible & therefore used to cut them out of the sides of hills as
is done here. In front & across the green country I have mentioned were
to the right the mountains of Palermo with the whole of the great bay,
Partenico, Alcamo & all; exactly in front a mass of rocky & peaked
mountain—to the left of that, beyond some cultivated heights, could be
seen the top of Mount Eryx (San Giuliano). All this under the sky & with
the temperature of a fine day in an English June. The whole earth
Edition: current; Page: [358] covered too with flowers & bushes, among
which last the palmetto or dwarf fan palm is one of the principal: its
little fan like leaves arranged in circles. From the path which ascends
to the theatre I could see, across the nearer heights, far to the south
east over a wide tract of central Sicily, to the central range, the
Madonie, or Nebrodes—the central part of the island seems to be of the
character of that I was in, rather than of the neighbourhood of Palermo,
& the Madonie themselves did not look comparable to the Palermo
mountains in beauty of form & position.—Finding that I had managed to
creep about at Segesta & that climbing was not worse for me than level
ground I tried to walk the three or four remaining miles to Calatifima,
but was obliged to give in before arriving there. I am sadly afraid the
overfatigue of yesterday is going to deprive me of my strength for as
long as the walk into Spezia did & that I shall have very little comfort
in this tour. The mulepath to Calatafima was mostly along the side of a
defile but the village itself is on the top of one of the hills bounding
it—the place is cheerful, the inn clean, though untidy & very like that
at Alcamo but a little inferior; the same sort of room, but smaller,
less recently whitewashed, & with beds in only three of the corners, the
door occupying the fourth. There are no fireplaces but I obtained pans
of charcoal for drying the papers, & tonight also for warming the room &
my feet, for which it was much required. You see very few labourer’s
houses in the great tract of which Alcamo is the centre & when I asked
my guide where the people were who cultivated all that land, he said
they lived at Alcamo, & that very few poor people live anywhere but in
towns. It is worth mentioning that a mounted gendarme or something like
it was sent with me to Segesta (sometimes going a little behind,
sometimes before) & the guide said, one is sent with all foreigners. I
do not know if it is because they thought I should conspire with the old
stones. My passport is sent for by the police every evening, & each time
I have to pay a carlino.

March 4. Trapani. From an early hour this morning (Sunday) the street
was full of country people, all males, standing talking, or standing
doing nothing, not moving about at all. In their dark coarse woollen
capotes I thought they looked not unlike Esquimaux. The capote is the
only thing like a costume I have seen in Sicily. Everywhere in Italy &
in most parts of France there are costumes, but in Sicily none—the dress
of all ranks, even the lowest as far as their poverty admits of, is
copied from that of Paris. The capote is very convenient, as by covering
the head & neck it dispenses with all need of an umbrella. I was
decidedly better today & performed the 26 or 28 miles journey in three
walks interrupted by two rides on the baggage. The sky was covered but
even so, the colour of the mountains which we left behind was something
quite indescribable—the loveliest gray, looking like a sort of gray
vapour. The road lay across the ravine, the side of which we Edition:
current; Page: [359] passed along yesterday, & up a hollow intersecting
it, among mountains which looked like ridges of the Malvern hills
perched aloft, with rolling corn country forming their lower portion:
until we reached a pass from which the western sea was visible & in it a
rocky mountain-shaped island, one of the Aegates,5 where the Romans
first broke the naval power of the Carthaginians. We then proceeded all
the rest of the day’s journey with Mount Eryx right before us, down a
gently declining champaign country widening out by degrees & at last
losing the mountain character except that the northern coast kept up its
superior picturesqueness by a line of peaks, of which Eryx seemed to
form the termination. Eryx towards this side is cliff, ending below with
a steep declivity at about the angle which would have been formed by
fragments falling from the cliff above. As we drew near to its base
Trapani came in sight; but by this time the day, which had been growing
worse by degrees, turned to violent rain with gusts from the south west
& on my opening out the waterproof to put it on for the first time,
imagine the vexation of finding that it had been strapped on the mule in
such a manner as to wear it completely into holes & that in several
places: spoilt (in appearance at least) before it had ever been used. It
is very annoying, for while this looked new it did not matter how shabby
might be the coat under it—& mine has now grown very shabby indeed. In
spite of the cape I got soaked as I have seldom been in the whole lower
part of the body—& could see little of the approach to Trapani except
that it ran parallel to the base of Eryx which seemed to slope very
gradually towards the town from summit to base though steep towards the
road. At about a mile from Trapani a large church stands alone with a
very handsome tower & a Gothic door, but all the rest of the building
like, it is saying nothing to say a barn, but like a prodigiously ugly
barn. Nothing can exceed in ugliness (externally) the churches of South
Italy & Sicily. They are a deformity instead of an ornament to the towns
except when these are looked down on from a height, when the multitude
of domes looks imposing. I shall say nothing of Trapani till tomorrow
when I shall have seen more of it—having decided to stay here a day.
There is a very decent carriage road all the way from Palermo here & I
might have come thus far in a carriage: but that road does not pass
Segesta: it is true I might have halted a day on the road & walked to
Segesta: but Palermo was a much better place for getting muleteers, & on
my plan of walking great part of the way the mule travelling seemed to
suit me better: I never foresaw the utter impracticability of mule
riding for me at present. There will soon be carriage roads to all the
places where foreigners go: the landlord here tells me there is one
completed as far as Marsala, & in progress from thence to Castel
Edition: current; Page: [360] Vetrano, the halting place for Selinus, or
Selinuntium as the guide books choose to call it. The inn, built by the
landlord as he says two or three years ago, is very clean & has a number
of rooms with one bed each—the beds are still of the same kind except
that the trestles have, one a head, the other a foot attached to them. I
suppose one could get a decent meal here, but I rely on my guide’s
stock, having paid him to feed me, all inn charges included. In
consequence I eat & drink just as I did at Palermo. In the green corn
country I passed through today there was none of the vegetation
characteristic of Sicily, but when I got to the foot of Eryx I came
again among olives, aloes & cactuses. I saw a great deal of fallow land,
& learnt from the guide that (except near Palermo where they have given
up fallows) the rotation is exactly as in Goethe’s time, one year wheat,
one beans & one fallow. But this is not so absurd here as it would be in
England, for having no meadows, they use the fallow land (which is a
natural meadow) to pasture their numerous cattle & sheep. The goats seem
to feed higher up. The road passed through an avenue (as it may be
called) of tall flowering asphodels & of thistles of which nothing is in
general yet apparent but the gigantic spreading leaves like artichoke
leaves.

March 5. The situation of Trapani is somewhat like that of St Malo: it
is on a tongue of land which just out far into the sea, but more
directly towards it than in the case of St Malo. This tongue gradually
narrows, & then (like a serpent’s) divides into two very thin prongs,
one of which forms a sort of natural jetty ending in a little castle,
the other is much longer & continued into the sea by a line of
rocks—having another insular tongue parallel to it. As the tongue on
which the town stands is not strait but curvilinear or rather has a
sharp bend on one side & a curve on the other, it has some resemblance
to a scythe & its handle, from which the Greeks gave it its name,
Drepanum. It is I think larger than St Malo, & very well paved with flat
stones: it has a Grande Rue carried strait along the middle of the
tongue, but of course from the crooked shape it cannot be carried the
whole length. I went into many large churches, & sat for a while on the
steps of the little castle at the end of one prong looking at the
Aegates one way & Eryx another. The day was bright, but began with a
watery look in the air: the sea however was its most perfect blue. The
whole coast south towards Marsala is flat & low, with other tongues of
land running out at intervals far into the sea. The isthmus connecting
the town with the main land is occupied (all but a little bit) with salt
pans, as I suppose they call those squares of salt water for solar
evaporation—& the salt is piled up looking white, in the form of the
eaves of a house. An aqueduct, not Greek or Roman however, reaches
nearly from the foot of Eryx to the town. I was not well today: my
digestion is as much disordered as it was in Tuscany, & I felt nearly as
feeble—After Edition: current; Page: [361] going about the town I
returned to rest for a time in my room which looks directly on Eryx,
with the sea to right & left. After resting & reading Theocritus I went
out again. I had intended to climb the mountain, which is often
done—indeed within the last two years a carriage road has been made to
the top: though it must be as high as Pellegrino which is about 2000
feet, there is a small town on the very top, as there was when the
temple of Venus Erycina was there, & when Hamilcar6 held out there for
ten years against the Romans. But the interior of the island being still
overclouded by yesterday’s rain, there was no promise of a very fine
view, & I was besides too weak to think of it. But when I went out in
the afternoon, meaning to botanize about the roots of the mountain I was
insensibly led into climbing & I scrambled over rocks to a minor height
on which there is a small castle & which seemed to be about half of the
whole height. From this I looked down upon a perfectly green plain,
spotted here & there with patches of olive, & a little varied at some
distance inland by hillocks which rose like the ripple of the sea—not
more—& by two small towns, for there are no villages here. I felt
despairingly as I sat looking at this view, simple as its elements are,
how utterly impossible it is by words to give any notion of it, as it
appeared with the flying shadows of clouds dotted over it—but it was not
characteristically Sicilian: rather English: none of the peculiar tints,
but an English June day: & I was greatly reminded of some of the views
from the Surrey chalk hills, on their steep side. I could hear most
distinctly all sounds below, even the carts moving along the road at a
considerable distance from the mountain foot. The likeness to England
was increased by a rookery—I heard yesterday, in coming, the cry of a
large flight of choughs, but here there were rooks also, making their
nests in the precipices of Eryx & emitting their accustomed cry. From
this place I easily got to the carriage road which ascends on a
different side of the mountain & which I could see winding all the way
up to the town on the summit. I walked down the winding descent & so
back to the town. It is curious that when I am too tired or weak to do
anything else I can climb mountains: that is if they are steep enough,
for a long ascending slope fatigues me greatly. I like to mount the
steep part & descend by the winding carriage road, as I did here. I
found many plants. I find that my botanizing at Palermo, aided by
Gussone’s Sicilian flora7 (the very best local flora I know except
Smith’s English flora8 & as good as that) has made me now perfectly
familiar with the common plants of this country, at least those which
are in flower now, & a good many that have not yet come into flower: so
that it is not now a strange new world of plants, but I look out for
Edition: current; Page: [362] fresh ones just as I should do in some new
part of England. This is a pleasant feeling. I have seen a good many
small birds, but none that I knew except larks, which abound, & though
they fly singly, give their pretty twitter in crowds from their nests on
the ground. I have heard a few birds sing very sweetly. In the chief
street of Palermo there was a nightingale in a cage singing most
beautifully, though the wild nightingales do not, I am told, begin
earlier than they do in England. I shall put this in the post tomorrow
before starting for Marsala. I shall probably send my next letter from
Girgenti & the next but one from Catania where I shall probably stay a
little while. I hope in my next to give a better account of my health. I
must conquer somehow this indigestion. I tried today by dining only (&
rather moderately) on macaroni, as I have done several times before, but
I had a most decided indigestion after it & had to take magnesia to
correct the acidity.—If the experiment had succeeded I meant to have
substituted macaroni at breakfast for the bread of the country, the
defects of which toasting does not correct as it does those of the other
kind of bread. O my darling what a long time it will be before I get a
letter again—but I shall find two I hope at Messina. I hope my sweetest
one gets all my letters—I have numbered them quite regularly & kept all
the dates. And now dearest it is considerably past twelve & I must say
good night.

March 6. Marsala. I found on enquiry that as there is not a post to
Palermo every day, this letter will reach Palermo quite as soon if sent
from Marsala. The new carriage road to Marsala does not go near the
shore, but near the beginning of the hillocks which I saw from Eryx—the
olive grounds & corn with the trifling elevations on the left & the sea
on the right made the country a good deal like some parts of the south
of France. The road leaves Trapani by the salines & from curiosity I
walked up to one of the piles of salt & found that it has no covering
whatever or protection from rain. No wonder the rock salt in the earth
escapes being dissolved: A little farther we reached a village—I beg
pardon of Sicily for having said yesterday that it possessed no village.
This is one, but does no credit to the island. The cottages are
certainly not like Irish, for they seem solidly built, though I saw but
one little grated window in the place—they have no light but what comes
in at the door. But the foulness may well match Ireland: the outskirts
of Palermo are already bad enough. Dunghills & all manner of refuse
occupy all the space about the houses. They have no idea apparently of
removing disagreeable objects out of sight or smell. I have been a good
deal better today both as to digestion & strength—else this would have
been a bad day for me. It is as well that there was little to see, for
the weather, threatening from the first, soon came down in showers first
light, then heavy, accompanied with gusts of wind, & neither in walking
nor on the mule could I Edition: current; Page: [363] escape a still
more thorough soaking than last time. I arrived early at a poorer inn
than any of the others, but the people are very civil & desirous to do
their best—as I find them everywhere. The place is not tempting & I
shall not deliver my letter of introduction unless it is too wet
tomorrow to go on. As I have hurt the thumb of my right hand, I think
with thorns in gathering palmetto leaves, I am scarcely able to write &
will say no more except all the loves & blessings that can be imagined.

It rained heavy during the night & began again in a sort of determined
way in the morning, & as it seemed undesirable to get wet a third time
immediately I determined to stay here today. In consequence, to fill up
the time, after reading till I was tired, the weather improving a little
I delivered my letter of introduction to Mr. Ingham.2 His place is about
two miles from the town, on the beach, from which he ships his wine in
lighters & tranships it again in the harbour of Marsala. It is a great
square place, & has in its neighbourhood Woodhouse’s3 & several other
similar establishments, English & Sicilian. I found him a totally
uneducated Yorkshireman, the best thing about whom was, that he did not
seem conceited or consequential. The only thing about his place that is
curious is the long galleries of immense butts of wine. He makes but
little wine himself, buying most of it from the peasants to whom in many
cases he advances money, making them attend in return, to his ideas of
cultivation &c. No doubt the wine making has been much improved by what
the English houses, Woodhouse in particular, have done. He was very
eager to make me take up my quarters with him from which I had great
difficulty in excusing myself but I could not avoid staying to dinner.
He has no wife or children & dines with his clerks (English) at half
past one. I was afraid of this departure from my regular habits but the
dinner has not disagreed with me more than my usual dinner does. What
mainly determined my calling on Ingham was to find out a medical man to
consult about my wounded thumb which had got much worse & more painful &
has now evidently a gathering of matter forming. He sent his bookkeeper
with me to a Edition: current; Page: [364] surgeon named Carlino4 who he
says is the best & the one he consults—the said Carlino who by the way
would not take any fee, advised to put on two or three leeches & then a
poultice of lettuce & rice. As I am sure no English practitioner would
advise more than a poultice for a thing which is (as he said this was)
merely superficial, I have dispensed with the leeches & my muleteer who
can do everything has made the poultice & it will be put on when I am in
bed. I do not anticipate any hindrance to travelling from it. The
weather remained showery till about three, when it cleared & as the wind
has again changed from south east to north I hope it will not rain
tomorrow. The town, walled rather than fortified, is small but built &
paved in the stile of a large one save that the streets are narrower—it
has the usual multitude of churches, some of them rather better looking
than ordinary outside, but poor inside—the cathedral a great bare
building. Between the town & the sea is a large cornfield of the most
splendid green, ending in the promontory of Lilyboeum, a low flat rocky
point of no length, but the extreme west point of Sicily to which
therefore I went. There was a fine view of the three Aegates, & of
Trapani across the intervening sea. The old harbour of Lilyboeum, formed
by a ledge of rocks north of the town, was filled up by Charles V.5
because it served as a shelter for the Barbary corsairs, whom the
monarch of half Europe could not prevent from harbouring in his own
territory except by destroying his own fine port. Like all the other
Sicilian towns I have seen this is full of convents, both of men & women
& I am now quite accustomed to find one or the other attached to every
church—as well as to see through open doors, the place where incomers
talk to the nuns through a grating—which grating also sometimes opens
into a church & I saw today a priest preaching to the nuns through one
grating & two other priests receiving confession through as many more.

March 8. Mazzara. A short day’s journey to this place, which is all of
which I am at present capable. The day was sunny, but like a fine day in
a wet July—& there has been one shower but not till after I arrived. The
road if such it can be called was at first within sight of the sea, but
on leaving it to cut off a point, soon lost sight of it, so flat is the
country. There never was a place where there was less excuse for the
want of a road: it is not among hills & wilds, but through & between
well cultivated fields, separated from the road by low walls—& the road
is simply a slip of country left uncultivated, Edition: current; Page:
[365] over which mules & carts go as they like or can. To make a good
road it would only be needful to root out the bushes, break the bits of
rock which stick out & lay the fragments on the remaining part of the
ground. It was not possible to walk three steps in a straight line, on
account of these hindrances & the puddles left by the past two days
rain. After a while cultivation ceased, & the track was over a waste,
wide as eye could see, covered with palmetto & asphodels which after a
time gave place to heath rosemary & cistus. Over this, which lasted
nearly to Mazzara, flocks of sheep & herds of cattle were thinly
scattered. Finding myself pretty well & strong this morning, I walked a
few miles without being tired & a few more a little tired, then mounted
on the baggage & when I got down again about three miles from Mazzara
was not only very tired but by the time I arrived at the inn & had sat
down for a few minutes my state was not that of a tired person but of
one just risen from a severe illness. It is very strange that mule
travelling should have this effect—if it is the mule travelling—& that
it should have it so much more some days than others. I could scarcely
creep about the little town & went into every church I found open for a
rest. The cathedral is large & handsomer than usual. The town which is
about as large as Marsala, with very bad streets but a very good Place,
is on the seaside just where a little river falls into the sea. I saw
abundance of fish in the market. In all the towns of South Italy &
Sicily even at Palermo with a very few exceptions, the shops are lighted
from the door only; & generally go but a very little way back: here
however going far back, either for rooms or cellars or I do not know
what, the darkness at midday & vault like appearance of them is quite
disagreeable. It is an object in these hot countries to exclude the
light & therefore are the houses generally so ugly—great walls with few
& small windows. And their architects have invented no sort of
ornamental construction adapted to these conditions. The inn here is a
trifle better than that at Marsala from which I have brought away
quantities of fleas. The good humour & serviceable disposition of the
people is the same everywhere though I have nothing to do with paying
them except a buona mano6 not exceeding a carlino a day.—My sore finger
drew very much with the poultice last night & though the place does not
seem near breaking it has given me so much less pain & annoyance today
that I shall not put on another tonight. The effect is visible enough in
my handwriting, though not so bad as yesterday. The Marsala wine comes
from all this country, which has not hitherto had much of the disease.
The vines at this season are stumps, as in France. Everybody blesses the
rain. I however am the sufferer. It rained out of season at Naples
because I was there—it did not rain at Palermo in the season because I
had not arrived, but began to rain out of season as soon as I came. How
the nuns Edition: current; Page: [366] stared at the foreigner through
their grating on the top floor of the convent adjoining the cathedral &
overlooking the Place; where they stood in a row as thick as they could
stand.

March 9. Castel Vetrano. Almost eaten up by fleas in the night from some
dozens of which I cleared my clothing night & morning. The night was
rainy & the day has been varied with sunshine & heavy showers—the state
of the ground however did more to make the journey fatiguing. The track
lay mostly over a wide waste like that we crossed yesterday—& such was
the difficulty of finding a dry place or one where there were stones to
step on that it answered better to walk up to my knees in bushes.
Everything here which is not limestone is clay & the soft limestone of
this country crumbles into a powder which makes a mud as heavy &
adhesive as clay. Yet I walked nearly all the way, for anything is
better for me than the mule travelling. When we had nearly reached a
small town named Campobello, we turned off to the right to see some
stone quarries three or four miles out of our road which people usually
go to see: but this turn brought the wind nearly in our faces (it had
till then been behind us) & a violent storm of rain & hail coming on, I
gave the signal for turning back & gave up seeing the quarries. The few
miles from Campobello here are over the same sort of waste. There is a
carriage road making from Mazzara here, but wherever it is made it is
either sharp stones or mud. I asked my guide how the people of Mazzara
live, as all the country round seems waste, & he answered, they are
almost all poor & almost all mariners. I wonder that of all who have
made what is called the tour of the island I have met with none who have
noticed how entirely devoid of beauty this south western part of it is.
In finer weather perhaps the mere vegetation would be enough to interest
one, but what is here seen of it is not fine & hardly characteristic.
The fields of flax are in flower & I saw yesterday some barley in ear,
but I am quite tired of a whole country covered with asphodels &
palmettos. Homer talks of “meadows of asphodels”7 & I much fear the
flowery meads of Enna from which Proserpine was carried off were mere
wastes like the one I have just crossed. There are no meadows properly
so called in any southern country except among mountains or where there
is irrigation. The first change for the better was just before entering
this cheerful little country town: when having gradually got up to
something of an elevation, we looked down to the right on a plain
covered with olives & some leafless trees, inclosed between this height,
the sea & some Dartmoor-shaped hills in the distance, among which very
far off was again a mountain—the top of which however was not visible.
This inn is a degree better than any lately—which to be sure is not
saying much. I am quite discouraged about Edition: current; Page: [367]
this journey. The rain has been pelting against the window at short
intervals ever since I arrived. It was all I could do by a succession of
charcoal pans to keep warm this evening. I must be stronger than I felt
this morning to have borne so fatiguing a walk. One comfort is that my
digestion seems to improve.

March 10. Another flea hunt night & morning: this time there were rather
fewer, & of those, fewer escaped. I believe I brought them all from the
last two places—I should not believe there were any here if it did not
seem impossible that they should not be continually brought here. (N.B.
in the middle of this sentence I stopt & caught one.) It is usual to go
from here to Sciacca seeing the ruins of Selinus by the way: but this
route, which is near the seaside, implies fording a river, which at
present from the rains is said to be unfordable; for which indeed Ingham
prepared me. The only thing to be done was to see the ruins from here, &
go tomorrow to Sciacca by another route which crosses the river by a
bridge: this is a long day’s journey but it would have been so, though
not quite so long, at any rate. Fortunately it was a fine day, though
with a wet July look, & no rain fell the whole day. I had only the
inconveniences of past without those of present rain. The road lay down
into & along the plain I looked down upon yesterday, through the olive &
pear trees, for such the leafless ones appeared to be: they are only
beginning to shew signs of flowering. To have an idea of the road,
imagine the worst lane you ever saw in some rocky part of England, after
a long succession of rainy weather. One is more dependent on dry weather
here than in England. No such quantity of rain as has fallen in these
few days after a long dry season, would have made walking difficult in
England: there would have been roads & clean footpaths which would have
kept tolerably dry. The distance to the ruins is seven Sicilian, about
eight English, miles, but it was nearly doubled by the ins & outs of
picking one’s way, though stepping stones were put in the worst places:
during a part of the way the road was a watercourse. At last we emerged
on a kind of grassy ridge with a hollow on our right & soon saw the
ruins in front at some distance. I could not have conceived that a mere
mass of fallen stonework could have looked so imposing at a distance.
Mrs Starke describes the place so as to give an entirely false idea,8
though I see her words do not exactly assert what they certainly
suggest. I expected to find that the columns of these temples were cut
out of single blocks of stone & that these had been thrown down
unbroken: this would indeed have been a wonder. But the columns like
those at Segesta were of one piece only horizontally: vertically they
consisted of Edition: current; Page: [368] many pieces piled one over
another: & on being thrown down (it is said by an earthquake) they broke
precisely into those pieces which with square fragments of walls or
pediments lie heaped over each other mostly with their angles uppermost
like nothing but some very rocky & lofty sea beach. Many of the columns
have a portion still erect, but only one a large portion: from this one
can judge how gigantic the temples must have been, especially the first
you come to (there are three parallel to one another & to the coast).
You cannot think of comparing this column to anything but a tall
lighthouse: you feel certain that there must be a winding staircase
within it, that the lower part is inhabited & the upper inhabitable.
These ruins are in the midst of corn & flax fields, entirely left to
themselves (there is however a farmhouse not far off). The two extreme
ones especially form by their piles of enormous blocks considerable
hillocks, to scramble over which is not a very easy matter. When you can
get upon a large block near the summit of either ruin, you see how the
town must have lain—the plain I have spoken of is at some elevation
above the sea to which it drops down here: the town must have been in
the hollow to the right, & up the two sides of the hollow; along the
summit of one of the sides stood these temples, visible from far at sea.
Nothing can give me a greater idea of the wealth & magnificence of these
Sicilian cities. The columns of the largest temple would have suited
only a building of the size of our largest cathedrals—& the length which
the pile of ruins of this one temple covers cannot be less than that of
Westminster Abbey. It would be a fine study for a painter of Marius
among the ruins of Carthage9—it is just the perfect wildness & perfect
ruin & destruction of great magnificence, which one figures to
oneself.—I walked to the ruins, & walked most of the way back, getting
on the mule in the wettest part of the way. Goethe, strange to say,
though he passed through Castel Vetrano, does not mention these ruins:10
he says a great deal about Segesta & Girgenti. Castel Vetrano seen from
this side looks larger than Marsala or Mazzara do from any side: it has
as large a cathedral, but differs from them in not being paved: being on
the slope of a rocky hill it does not need paving so much. The inn is
both cheerful & compared with the others, even comfortable, & I could
stay here if necessary with more satisfaction than anywhere since
Palermo. My digestion continues to improve—it is better than it has been
since it first got wrong.

Edition: current; Page: [369]
March 11. Sciacca. As we had 35 Sicilian, about 40 English, miles to go
today, the guide very reasonably proposed to start at seven: but after I
was up & ready it was raining steadily & the sky was one mass of
unbroken cloud, seeming to preclude our going any further today. However
after I had breakfasted & read two idyls of Theocritus & a canto of the
Purgatorio of Dante (I finished the Inferno, as well as Tasso, long
since) there seemed some signs of clearing, the rain ceased & we started
at half past nine, the mules receiving an extra feed to enable them to
do the whole distance without stopping; & they arrived here, apparently
not fatigued, at half past six. Of course I had to do a considerable
part of this on the mule, but I certainly walked a good deal more than
half, & under such difficulties as you may suppose. I never knew before
what a country without roads is. I fancied there were mule paths like
those at Nice or Sorrento: but those are made roads as much as turnpike
roads are, & as well suited for the kind of traffic they are meant for
as the ground admits. Not above five miles of the forty today were made
roads, & that was where the soil was so dense a clay that it would have
been totally impassable unless paved in the middle. Taught by experience
I now knew that in so long a day’s journey there was nothing to do
except to splash, not exactly through thick & thin, but through thin,
reserving my efforts to avoid the thick when possible. When you consider
that I had to ride on the mule for long distances with my feet in the
state this implied, you will see that this mode of travelling would have
been madness if I had been at all in the condition of a pulmonary
patient. Evidently the pulmonary disease has long been arrested, & my
digestion & general health are the things to be now considered, & the
walk today with all its difficulties was not at all too much. I always
got off the mule when my feet began to get cold. The day cleared very
slowly & was tolerable at last, though there was one smart shower
towards evening. The wind now a tramontana11 & coldish, was behind us
all the way.—A few miles from Castel Vetrano we emerged on a wide moor—I
do not know what else to call it: there was no grass, (except in a spot
here & there) except tufts of a very coarse tall grass such as we see on
a hardy wet English heath. The place of heath was taken by palmetto &
asphodel, with daphne, thistles, & the bushy root leaves of a large
umbelliferous plant universal in Sicily, which the people call fennel
but wrongly: it may be what used to be called fennel giant. This moor
like many in England stretched & swelled into hills separated by ravines
extending to the sea, which was almost always visible. These ravines
grew deeper & hills higher & across them we had to make our way. About
halfway we came to a town or village, called by the guide Membrici: it
was a strange place—it had a main street I should think a mile long, &
many short streets crossing it at right angles all perfectly straight,
all neatly paved (though with cailloux) & all with raised Edition:
current; Page: [370] trottoirs on both sides: while the houses (even in
the main street) which had a story above the ground floor, were a small
minority, & most of those looked as perfect hovels as the rest. The
country now became more covered with green corn & the valleys not so
deep. All day we had been coming nearer to the one mountain I saw two
days ago & this, on which the sunshine & clouds made fine colours, now
appeared to be the vanguard of many other mountains, yet only partially
visible. One, much lower than itself, was between it & the sea, & at the
foot of this lay Sciacca—itself on a height, just over the sea. The
first view of this as we approached it from a height, shewed behind it a
bay bounded by mountains, & it appeared that here at last the beautiful
part of Sicily was to recommence: it will be provoking now if I miss
seeing it properly, through the malice of the superior powers in putting
off the rainy season till my arrival. We entered Sciacca just after
dark: it was lighted with oil lamps & seems very neatly paved & clean—in
the centre of it we came upon a scene of hurly burly, the main street
forming a most noisy & crowded market by lamplight, of every conceivable
(in Sicily) eatable thing—at one end of this is the inn & the window of
my room overlooks & overhears it. It is too late now my precious to
write any more tonight.

March 12. Montallegro. The market at Sciacca was as noisy this Monday
morning as it was on Sunday night. Sicily is the only country I know
where bread is commonly sold not in shops but in markets & at stalls in
the street. There was an immense quantity of bread visible, & it was
everywhere marked of three qualities, at 11, 10 & 9 Sicilian grains
(only half the Neapolitan grains) the rotolo: about five farthings the
English pound. It is very good bread, to be the common bread of the
people: & I now find it agrees with me as well as any other. The morning
at first promised fair, but when we started at half past eight it
rained, & the whole day was a succession of heavy showers: each longer &
coming after a shorter interval than its predecessor. It is hard to have
the north wind & the rainy weather too. Dr Strange says the March winds
are hurtful to pulmonary patients by their dryness. The present one has
not that fault at least. But as our course lay not far from south,
having the wind behind us during the rain was an advantage: if we had
not I do not know what I should have done. The great inconvenience in
walking today was the dense clay. The situation of Sciacca is beautiful,
& as we advanced the bay shewed itself, resembling en petit the gulf of
Salerno & with mountains round it looking like those of Antibes from
Nice. To the left one after another of the mountains of the interior
came in sight. We travelled over clay hills lying between these
mountains & the sea. The heights were less steep & high & the ravines
not so deep & narrow as yesterday: & we crossed successively three broad
valleys, fording a river in each, which in the third (much swollen by
the rain) could not from the rapidity of the current Edition: current;
Page: [371] have been done if two men had not waded through holding the
mules: though all three streams in ordinary times are very small. These
valleys, & some of the other hollows with sloping sides are at present
great fields of green corn without a building of any kind in sight. The
intervening heights, except a patch here & there, are moor such as I
described. When I came out on the height overlooking the second of the
three valleys I saw a mountain scene, spread out before me from right to
left, which though rain was falling on most of it I could see to be
equal to anything I have seen in Sicily: it most resembles in variety of
summits, heights & distances the Cumberland mountains seen from near
Keswick. Every step now brought us nearer to these, & at last we put up
at a real village—a little country village, just among the first of
those mountains—& I felt as if just entering into the Alps or Pyrenees.
I walked less today. Finding myself able to do so much yesterday, &
setting out strong today I thought I had got over the hurtfulness of the
mule travelling, especially as it is no longer painful as it was: but
having remained on the mule about an hour to cross the first river & its
valley (quite impassable from mud) when I got down afterwards I was in
the same strange state as before—unable to walk, save at a creeping
pace—the nervous energy completely gone, as if it were the beginning of
paralysis. At this pace we should never have arrived & I had to get up
again & be carried nearly all the rest of the way notwithstanding wet
feet—though when they got very cold I tried to warm them a little by
walking. The horrid weather, which gets worse every day, has entirely
spoilt this tour, but though if I had foreseen this I should not have
come, I am glad that I did come, since it has been good for my health
(though my digestion has not quite kept up the improvement I mentioned).
I have gained a knowledge of what this country is—& I have got many
plants. I must look to the Greek part of the journey now for enjoyment.
This day’s journey was 24 Sicilian or about 27 English miles. The room
is bare enough but differs from those in the towns chiefly by having
still less furniture. It has no glass to the windows: only shutters, &
not always these. But the situation is charming. And now I must leave
off, for the industrious fleas are so teazing every part of my body that
I must begin the attack. They evidently get in every evening through the
legs of the trousers.

March 14. Girgenti. Heavy rain again put off our starting: when we did
start it was, & continued, lowering weather, but no more rain for some
hours. The road & its vicinity can be compared to nothing but a ploughed
field in the Weald of Kent after two months rain. We went first along a
valley between two ranges of low rocky mountains, beyond one of which
was the sea. In fine weather this, & all the journey of today, would be
most beautiful. We again forded a river in the same manner as on the
12th & from its depth & rapidity it was evident that the much larger
river of the 12th was by this Edition: current; Page: [372] time
unfordable. We passed through a little gap & came out on the side next
the sea, but soon diverged to cut off a point, passing up a valley to a
little town called Siculiana. Here the rocky mountain paths on one side
of the road, furnished for a short time firm footing. The rocks here are
crystalline, some of them very beautifully, & I recognized these as
gypsum. For a mile out of Siculiana (which seen from outside looked
exactly like the towns in the old engravings with every house marked)
the top of a stone wall afforded a footpath. Then the mud returned. We
shortly reached the top of the pass & looked down on the Gulf of
Girgenti—to which we soon descended. It looked as dark as muddy water
could make it, with an immense rolling surf—the wind being now violent.
The bay is overlooked by clay cliffs, like those at Boulogne along the
base of which we passed—at the approach to the Port of Girgenti these
are tapissé with a sort of ice plant. The port, though there seemed but
little shipping, seemed well built & looked rather prosperous. It is one
of the chief export places for sulphur. Caravans of mules & donkeys
laden with lumps or cakes of sulphur preceded us from Montallegro.
Girgenti itself is about four miles from the port & the road between
them as good as an English turnpike road. The first sight of Girgenti
though it was already raining was very striking. It spread out on a
mountain about the height of Volterra, forming part of a basin of low
mountains or high hills (which you please) grouped very finely &
resembling on a larger scale some of the country at the foot of
Dartmoor. The lower slope of the Girgenti hill is covered with cactuses
of which we have seen few lately & the plain richly cultivated. By this
time the weather had changed from sunshine at the port to a violent
thunderstorm. I thought I had never heard thunder so grand: a tremendous
crash at first, lengthened out by reverberation from so many hills at
different distances that after the sound had partly died away it
returned louder from some more distant hill, sometimes after it had
quite stopt. (Before we had got quite up the hill it had ceased, but
returned two or three hours after with the most brilliant sheet
lightning.) A tempest of wind, hail & rain accompanied it. The inn is
decent, better than any lately, though worse than anything one ever
thinks of calling an inn. It has a splendid view from my window, across
the narrow plain to the sea. The town seems ugly internally. My hurt
thumb which even after the gathering broke, has never ceased to trouble
me, is now evidently gathering again, & I poulticed it again last night,
which is the reason I did not write till this morning. I shall now go to
the post & next to the Consul12 with Goodwin’s letter as he may possibly
give me some advice about getting to Catania. I am not at all inclined
in this weather to go on with mules, if I can get a carriage at all
decent, & at a price not too extortionate: though the manifold
capabilities of the muleteer who undertakes for provisions & does
everything I need—in every way, are some weight on the other side. Today
the weather Edition: current; Page: [373] is sunny after the storm but
there is no appearance of a change—Reading this letter through I find it
is all dry narrative without a word of the love I have been feeling &
which is my comfort & strength. My darling will know that I am thinking
all the time of her & that her existence & love are to me what the Deity
is to a devout person—I feel through everything that she is the fond of
my existence, all the rest plays on the surface. It is writing to her in
the evening about the day’s incidents that makes them interesting. But I
have not wished for her in any of these uncomfortable places, though I
did constantly at Palermo. Adieu now my dearest angel—love me always.

By the same good fortune in the middle of bad which I had at Selinus I
had now one of the most beautiful of days for seeing the temples. They
are by far the finest I have seen, taking situation into account: a bad
situation is the great defect of those at Paestum. But these are not
only in the very places to which one would go for the sake of the finest
views that can be had, but also are seen from far on every side & are as
strikingly beautiful from far as from near. They are on the plain,
speaking comparatively with the present town (which is said to be on the
site of the Acropolis of the ancient town) but really on a line of lower
heights, separated from the town by a deep hollow, which is said to have
been occupied by the old Agrigentum, the second in magnitude & power &
the first in wealth & luxury of the Greek cities of Sicily. Nothing can
exceed the view from the sloping road which descends the mountain
eastward & exhibits the principal temples in many combinations &
distances with the sea behind them. I then passed over the hollow filled
with olives & larger almond trees than I ever saw, all in full leaf &
with a summer aspect. The temples deploy themselves on a succession of
decreasing heights. The first two, in the highest & best positions, are
also the best preserved, especially the second, known as the Temple of
Concord, but so called on no authority at all, neither did the Greeks
erect temples to abstractions, though the Romans did. In this temple not
only the row of columns, double in front, & single all round, with
pediments & entablature are perfect, but also the walls of the inner
recess or cella, of which at Paestum one only with difficulty traces the
outline. Here the two long sides are complete (though some narrow round
arches were cut through them in the middle ages when this temple was
used as a church), also the front with the great Egyptian looking
gateway: only the other short end, behind the Edition: current; Page:
[374] altar, is gone: great part of the altar itself is preserved.
Nothing almost is wanting but the roof. Within the wall adjoining the
gateway is a staircase of 42 steps winding not round but square, which I
went up & came out level with the tops of the columns: Of the temples of
Hercules & Jupiter Olympicus, only ruins remain: in the latter nothing
is erect, in the former only a broken column: but the entire outlines
are shewn in what remains. In that of Jupiter Olympicus the blocks,
enormous as they are, do not lie heaped on one another as at Selinus, as
if the temple had just been thrown down, but merely lie about, most
having evidently been removed: but it is striking from its amazing size:
you know how small the interior of a house looks when in building or
pulling down it shews only the ground plan—this on the contrary looks as
large as the nave of St Peter’s & combining it with the immense
dimensions of the portions of columns, capitals & pediments which lie on
the ground, it must have been as imposing as the temples of Egypt. There
are three other ruined temples close together, but the remains of two
are trifling & the third nothing comparable to those I have mentioned.
The old walls of the city went along these heights & are partly of the
native rock—hollowed out everywhere into cavities for tombs—a really
curious sight. Mrs Starke most absurdly disparages these temples on the
ground that those which are more complete than Paestum are not so large,
& those which are larger than Paestum are mere ruins.2 I never knew
rightly what a Greek temple was till I saw these, & I shall be surprised
if anything I see at Athens is finer—not to mention the glorious
situation. Returning to the city, whenever I looked back, the mountain
line further on the coast towards Palma & Alicata looked indescribably
beautiful in the late afternoon lights. I had put off my walk till
afternoon by which I got the ground tolerably dry under the warm sun &
drying wind: but the roads here are good. Before my walk I called on the
Vice Consul, a Mr Oates, & presented my note from Goodwin—he had been
expecting me for some days & Goodwin had very politely sent me a
Galignani through him—of the 20th, the latest I have seen. This does not
contain what has been heard through private letters, the resignation of
some more of the ministers.3 But it says that then the frost was harder
than ever in England & the Thames frozen over—how very unpleasant this
is. I have no doubt there is some round about connexion between it & the
untimely rains at Naples & here. Oates, an elderly quiet bland sort of
man, was very civil without being obtrusively so. His son, a young man
of about 20, offered to enquire for me about carriages to Catania—There
are only two to let for hire in the town, & these do not go long
journeys—the only chance is a return carriage & this young man thought
one had arrived from Palermo—it had, but when I called on my return to
learn the result, he said Edition: current; Page: [375] that the man
demanded five days instead of three, & 35 piastres—all my conceptions of
possible demand had not gone beyond double what I pay to my muleteer for
board, lodging & all which for the same distance would be only 15
piastres or for three days only nine—& 18 was the utmost I thought would
be even asked. If the weather looks well tomorrow—(& this evening as
well as day have been fine & Oates thinks the thunderstorm has ended the
bad weather) I shall go on with my muleteer, not to Catania but to
Syracuse, which is not further by mules, & saves the journey thither
from Catania. I believe it is also much finer country & the muleteer
says the inns are fully better than those I have passed. I find no
meaning or truth hitherto in Bartlett’s comparative estimate of the
different inns. But they may have got better or worse since he passed,
though that was only two or three years ago. Young Oates also offered to
take me tomorrow to see the museum of Signor Politi,4 the great
antiquarian of this part of Sicily. In return for these civilities I
could not refuse to dine with them tomorrow, en famille, that is, father
sons & a very common looking daughter.

15th. The morning broke fine but soon changed, & at one o’clock I was
caught in a rain which lasted till dark. I wandered about in the
vicinity of the temples, & particularly observed the two well preserved
ones from the side next the sea. A mural ledge of rocks, which is so
common at the top of limestone ridges, had been well taken advantage of
by the people of old Agrigentum as a fortification for their city—& it
is curious that in this they should have excavated their tombs. Before
this I had gone with young Oates to Politi’s museum—he is a painter, an
architect & much besides & a bland old gentleman but his vases, medals
&c. are nothing remarkable to any one who has seen others. I went also
to the cathedral, a large bare building with ancient columns
whitewashed! there is a sarcophagus with very fine Greek alti relievi of
Phaedra & Hippolytus which Goethe admired extremely.5 I dined with Oates
according to engagement—he has ten children—all born at Naples or in
Sicily: two sons are now in England & two daughters at Palermo: the rest
live with him, including two married daughters with their pleasant
looking Sicilian husbands & their young children the whole of whom dined
at one table. He appears to have no wife alive. The daughters looked
very vulgar English but the English they spoke, & the son likewise, was
foreign in accent & often in idiom. I cannot manage to converse in
Italian yet, beyond short sentences. Oates says the climate here is
cooler in summer & colder in winter than Palermo—they have less of the
scirocco. Living is Edition: current; Page: [376] dear, houserent dear,
everything he says dear, from overtaxation & protecting duties. All
provisions are dearer at little Girgenti than at great Naples as he
knows, having lived at both. I do not much trust any general impressions
however, for he said the country people are very badly off, but it
appeared they earn 14 or 15 pence a day which to them cannot be great
poverty. The lands in this neighbourhood are by his account all church
property, held on cottier tenure. He seems to have a thorough hatred of
the priests & he says nobody in Sicily cares one jot for them or the
Pope—even the common people do not care for the Pope, only for the
saints. At the first possible turn in Europe he is convinced that
everything will go, Catholicism & all. He had just got Galignani up to
the 23d. So the three ministers ran away from Roebuck’s investigation.6
It is believed all over Sicily that the Emperor Nicholas is dead—died
suddenly on the 2nd of this month.7 If so there will soon be an end of
the war. Meanwhile it pained me to see that the frost continued worse
than ever up to the latest date. Oates’ is the best looking & best
situated house in Girgenti but there were no fireplaces in it till he
made them. There never are any, he says. He presses me to stay here till
the weather improves but as he does not now think it will improve till
the end of the month I cannot spare the time unless I give up Greece. I
do not now expect to have any enjoyment of Sicily at all except five of
the ten days at Palermo, & the first two of this journey. But after all
it is but five mule days to Syracuse, where I come into good inns—& from
Palermo here has been twelve days of which only the first two were free
from rain or the still worse consequences of rain. If it does not pour
tomorrow I shall go.

16th Palma. A fine morning & the day was uninterruptedly fine
throughout. I therefore took leave of Oates & by starting about eleven
(the day’s journey being short) gave the sun time to dry up the country
a little: so that about half the way was walkable with more or less
difficulty: the rest I was carried over. I had availed myself of my stay
at Girgenti to replace my old trousers & boots which this journey has
completely finished, by others of Girgenti manufacture which really look
much better than I expected. The road for some miles had beautiful views
of the temples, & of Girgenti itself for many more, each time that we
crossed a height & we only finally lost sight of it when we crossed the
mountain ridge which looked so beautiful the other evening. All the way
the sea was near on the right & the range of low mountains on one of
which Girgenti stands, on the left, but from this ridge we also saw
across into the interior which was very mountainous, with one very fine
peaked mountain, which the guide called the mountain of Camerata.
Edition: current; Page: [377] Beyond this ridge the low range of
mountains came still nearer & we soon came in sight of Palma a small
town which like most others on this coast is on a height & dominates a
narrow plain, only here the plain, included between two mountain ridges
projecting out into the sea, is itself all hill & dale. This town like
Siculiana looked exactly like the towns in the old prints—every house
separate, & consisting only of what in those prints is taken as the
smallest amount of detail which will do to represent a house—with low
tiled roof & perhaps one tiny window visible. It was a comfort here & at
Girgenti to see no domes—& the renouncing of those tiresome domes led at
once to making a comparatively good front & towers to the principal
church. The carruba trees are very fine hereabouts—they are the most
spreading, luxuriant, clean looking & altogether finest trees I have
seen in Sicily. The inn at this tiny place is decidedly better than the
one at Girgenti: the whole house has been quite recently whitewashed,
which is a good sign: & a propos, four men passed the window with quite
clean cotton nightcaps on their heads, a sight which struck me with
wonder. The inn had silver spoons too which I had not seen since
Palermo, but I do not find a flea the less. The way I find is to attack
these creatures early in the morning before they are awake, by which
means I killed this morning about eight out of twelve which were asleep
on my flannel waistcoat. The chairs here are of a kind I never saw
before, the seats made of a network of packthread. The number of
caravans of animals loaded with sulphur which we met today was very
great.

17th. Terranova. I did the inn at Palma injustice, for I found but one
flea on my clothes in the morning, & this probably was one of those I
brought with me. Another splendid day from morning till night & there is
now every appearance of the continuance of fine weather. We started a
little before eight, & the morning lights in the valley of Palma were
most pleasant, but the day soon grew & continued hazy, as I suppose must
be expected during the drying up of wet. But the sun pitches in so
strong that there was little difficulty in walking from wet ground in
the morning & none in the afternoon. After getting out of the valley of
Palma we crossed a ridge & descended into a wider plain with no village
or buildings in it, & soon reached the beach & went some way along sand
hills: then, to cut off a point, went along the foot of the ridge which
bounded the plain on the further side & which was lovely with
trees—though they were all olives & other fruit trees, but of immense
size. We then crossed the ridge at a low point, & came out on a view of
a great bay with the land beyond it heading away to the south,
apparently high inland & low on the coast, quite to Cape Passaro, the
southern promontory of the island: So at least the guide said, though I
rather think from the map that what I saw must be Point Spinapesce, some
distance short of Cape Passaro. This view of half the length of the
longest of the three coasts of the Edition: current; Page: [378] island,
brought back a feeling I had very strongly in the first two or three
days of this excursion—that going round Sicily is very like going round
the Isle of Wight. We passed through only a corner of the little port of
Alicata or Licata, which is next to Girgenti as a port for the
exportation of sulphur—several ships were in the offing waiting for
it—Goodwin told me that 20,000 tons of sulphur are exported from Sicily
every year. We then passed the river Salso, the largest river I have
seen in Sicily, by a ferry, & having crossed the plain of Licata, the
rest of our way was along the shore with generally clay (but
occasionally gypsum) cliffs to our left. The clear sea horizon was most
beautiful & a number of fishing boats out at sea stood up in front of it
most beautifully. There is a very perceptible tide here—the breadth of
beach which was left wet by the receding water was considerable:
Whenever we could see into the interior, which was especially the case
in crossing the last sandhill into Terranova, we could see beyond the
rather large plain of that town, & mountainous country very wildly
thrown about. Various bold points jutted out into the sea, with usually
an old tower on them. This was a long day’s journey, 36 Sicilian miles
(41 English) & we did not arrive till it was almost completely dark, &
found, in this mostly unpaved town (which has a large, & for Sicily
fine, cathedral) an evening market by lamplight as active as at Sciacca.
This has not been a good day with me. I had an indigestion all day, but
I walked a great part of the way. At last I knocked up from fatigue of
the back & abdominal muscles, by sitting on the mule, & had to lay
myself down on the side of a sandhill—but soon recovered by walking. The
inn here is as clean & good as that at Palma & I have not perceived a
single flea. Bartlett & every other book represented the inns between
Girgenti & Syracuse as so much worse than any others that I thought that
route at any rate must be avoided. On the contrary, coming to these from
the others is like coming into a more civilized country. Here there is
an attempt at all sorts of things like the regular inns of other
countries. On a part of the sandhills there grows a beautiful white
broom which filled the air with perfume like a fine bean field.

18th. As the next day’s journey was to be again a very long one, I
thought it prudent after yesterday’s fatigue to give myself a day’s
rest. The days when one halts are the pleasantest of all, but I grudge
them, because each is the loss of a day in Greece. However I needed it,
for I felt weak all day. The day was again splendid, & a south wind was
gently blowing—the driest wind here, because coming from the
neighbouring coast of Africa. The weather has apparently settled, & I am
lucky in this that the rainy weather came when there was least to see. I
left the town by the eastern gate, & was thinking nothing particular
about the place but feeling the not disagreeable melancholy Edition:
current; Page: [379] which a fine day in the country tends to give (when
one is alone). I turned my eyes round, & there stood Aetna! there over a
pass in the nearer mountains, against the cloudless sky, she stood, not
looking so high as I expected, because the brilliant white colour made
her seem only just behind the other mountains, & also because her vast
base makes the ascent to the conical summit, as seen from here, rather
gentle. All that was visible of the mountain, which seemed almost the
whole, was one unbroken mass of snow, like the Jungfrau from Interlaken:
across which, in the course of the day, light summer clouds sometimes
flitted, seeming like dark spots on the white. But before evening it
looked an immense height, because I had more realized the distance.
Terranova is built on one of the sandhills (though it is clay at the
base next the sea) & this being very steep & tolerably high the town
looks down over the green plain, an unusually large one, to the
amphitheatre of low mountains which bounds it. Down the hill, on the
beach, is the little port, where I saw them shipping sulphur in lighters
to take it to the ships further out. I wandered over the sandhills, &
seashore, & botanized, not walking to any great distance, but seeking
out places to sit down which best combined in one view the sea, the
picturesque looking town, the coast & the mountains. The sun was almost
too hot to walk but not too hot to sit down in, facing the breeze. In
the evening I went out on the roof of the house, one of the highest in
Terranova, from which the little town looks as well as so dirty &
squalid a place can, & Aetna & the mountains are seen to perfection as
well as the whole coast, to Alicata one way, & the cape (Passaro or not)
the other. The woman who shewed it to me thought the plain of Palermo
nothing to it—you should have seen her gesture in speaking of Palermo.
In this I totally differed from her but this is very fine also though
the mountains eastward are ridges & with these & all the others (except
Aetna) low compared with those of Palermo. At Terranova there seems a
very active manufacture of maccaroni, vermicelli & various other forms
of paste, which are spread or hung out in the sun to dry—also much
pottery, baking in the sun: here, as at Sciacca & elsewhere numberless
amphorae & jars of the exact pattern of the ancients: as well as the
large semicylindrical tiles of which the roofs are made. There has been
ringing of bells, firing cannon & musketry, & military music at
intervals all day, it seems on account of the feast of St Joseph which
is tomorrow, & this the Sunday preceding it. I perceive the town is
paved with small stones, but the accumulation of earth & rubbish on the
pavement hid it from me in the twilight. There are plenty of fleas here,
as I found this morning. Among the marks of civilization a comb &
clothes brush (or rather hatbrush) were presented, one stuck into the
other. A little way at the eastern gate is one immense column, in the
Selinus stile, lying broken on the ground, capital & all: this is the
only relic I saw of Edition: current; Page: [380] the ancient Gela,
which stood close to this place. The present town was built by the
emperor Frederic 2d.8

19th Chiaramonte. We started at half past seven & I was much more
vigorous for my day’s rest. The sandhills drop down a little beyond
Terranova into ordinary dunes. We crossed the green plain by a mere
track to the flat hills on the east side of it. When we got among these
the way lay over country which is like nothing so much as the very
finest English commons: instead of the asphodel, bushes of different
sorts—a yellow thorny broom in full flower & as brilliant as ours, ilex,
juniper, two kinds of cistus of which one in flower (a large white
flower almost as large as the gum cistus) quantities of phillyroeas &
many pretty verdant bits of grassy pasture intermixed. We crossed
valleys & heights of this character, occasionally seeing Aetna from the
heights & the sea to our right diverging to a greater distance, for we
were now going inland, to cut off the south east corner of the island.
At last we turned up a cultivated valley directly from the sea, bounded
by heights of the same description, & after a time ascended a ridge to
the right, to a small town named Biscaro, commanding splendid views both
ways. Here we saw before us the long line of high ground ending with
Cape Passaro, which I had seen across the bay from the heights above
Alicata. They were high hills rather than mountains, having a mere
waving line of ridges instead of summits, & as we descended into the
plainlike valley between, it seemed very like crossing Sussex to get to
the South Downs: only these must be about three times the height. Aetna
was visible all the way, at last with her breast hidden by clouds & only
the great summit appearing above—but the clouds were only like a dark
girdle. On the very summit are two or three permanently dark spots,
probably precipices too steep for snow to lie. The shape of Aetna is not
conical, for the outlines are curves, not straight lines: it is nearer
to a hemisphere than a cone, & is in truth a very broad paraboloid. In
front of us was the little town of Chiaramonte (where I am now writing)
about halfway up the hill, & looking from a distance like the entrance
to some old quarry on the side of a chalk hill: but this is before the
folds of the hillsides display themselves. There is a long rather steep
rise in the country before you get to the base of the hill itself. From
every part of the ascent & from Chiaramonte itself the view is
splendid—you see much further than Alicata, & the sea to a great
distance: & all the ridges & inequalities in the country I have just
crossed are so dwarfed by the distance & the superior height that the
whole looks like one plain, extending to the central mountains.
Certainly plains also are among the fine things in nature: especially
when they are as diversified in colouring & character as this is,
chequered with trees & varied with verdant cultivation. About Biscari
were some Edition: current; Page: [381] immense trunks of old carruba
trees. The day was magnificent, & remembering what Naples was in
February, I did not wonder that in Sicily & in March it felt like a hot
July day. But it is noticeable that one does not the less want a fire in
the evening & I regularly freeze till I get my braciere.9 The inn here
is the worst I have come to, & the only one which quite deserves the
abuse of Sicilian inns—I mean as to comfortlessness & dirt: insects I
have not yet observed. Today has I believe carried off (by the aid of
medicine) the indigestion of the last day or two & I feel unusually
well. I have been thinking lately that I am perhaps wrong in drinking no
wine. My reason was to avoid increasing the feverishness which belongs
to pulmonary disease: but I never have any of this now; I am never
feverish, except now & then from indigestion (yesterday was the first
time for months) & the stomach is the main thing which requires
assistance. Now it is very possible that at my time of life the
digestion needs to be aided by some stimulus, & we must remember that
for many years I had not abstained altogether from wine, beer &c, as I
now have for a year & a half. I feel sure that bitter ale or porter
would have been good for me today, & I have felt so several times
lately. While I seemed to digest well it was better to change nothing,
but it is a different thing now when I cannot reckon upon my digestion:
it is exactly a case for experiments. I get excellent provisions
excellently cooked, thanks to my guide who provides the materials at the
places where they are to be had & cooks them himself: my most unual
dinner is soup, chicken & potatoes.

20th. Palazzuolo. A day to be long remembered for the extreme beauty of
the journey through the highlands of south eastern Sicily. We started as
before early, & ascended the remainder of the range of hills on the side
of which Chiaramonte stands. The view behind us as might be expected was
still finer than yesterday evening, for these hills which I said were
three times the height of the South Downs, are nearer to being three
times that of the Malvern Hills. We saw as far as to a mountain beyond
Sciacca but the country about Terranova & along the coast were hid by
cloud or sea fog on which looking down the effect was singular: looking
on the upper surface of the clouds their inequalities resembled round
bushes or clumps of trees. As we ascended we saw more & more of Etna
(which the people here call l’Etina, a word I could not make out at
first) & at last from a point on one of the principal heights it
displayed itself in full grandeur; raised high by intermediate heights,
& by the much greater portion which was visible, including a large dark
region free from snow: & from this proceeded east & west the whole range
of the Nebrodes or Madonie, beginning about the level of the dark part
of Aetna, but rising here & there above that level, topped with snow, &
one distant mountain quite covered with it. This range of mountains
Edition: current; Page: [382] seemed to flow from Etna & one could fancy
it a lava stream which had all come out of the crater. Some distance
further on we came in sight of the view the other way—commanding a vast
extent of country all in ridges & vallies strangely thrown about. You
can imagine a great extent of hilly country, formed of rock & therefore
angular, but of soft rock which wears away by water, & you know what an
infinity of hollows of all sorts will be carved out by mere water
power—so it was here. Certainly, whatever one sometimes thinks, the view
of hills & mountains is not everything, the view from them is something
quite peculiar—the vast multitude of distinguishable places & objects
which the eye takes in at once, while one feels lifted out of all the
littleness of it & conscious of a beauty which seems lent to it by
something grander. Dieu merci there are views of this kind in England
within a walk of dear Blackheath, which have affected me at times, in
equally fine weather, quite as much as this; but not in the month of
March. The remainder of the journey was through & among these hollows &
ridges—hollows innumerable with several bold ridges stretching in
different directions: & from every height there was the same view with
variations—one in particular I remember, a long winding valley
stretching far below us, we overlooking not only the valley but the
gradually descending heights which formed it—as one fancies the valley
in Tennyson’s Oenone,10 only that there is no forest or turf here: the
valley ends in a plain & the plain soon terminates in the eastern sea.
This way however there was a good deal of haze, while overhead there was
a Nice sky, & all was bright & clear from the direction of Etna. There
was a pleasant southerly wind, the much abused Scirocco, which brought
some clouds to mitigate the really oppressive heat of the sun. The
sunshine on the snow of Etna produced a peculiarly soft tint, quite
unlike the white glare of snow, verging a little upon yellow. At last we
came in sight of the sea in front, & at the same time saw Palazzuolo our
sleeping place where we arrived by two in the afternoon. It is a
village-like town, but of considerable size, & much more neatly built &
kept than common in Sicily—standing round the end & near the top of one
of the highest ridges. Although I was tired, having walked the greatest
part of the way, I set out again soon to visit the remains of the Greek
town of Acrae, which stood at the very top of this same ridge. There is
the most perfect theatre I have yet seen, with the steps almost
unbroken—& what is much more curious, an amazing quantity of tombs
elaborately cut out in the soft rock, much more elaborate & curious than
those at Girgenti. There was a museum here, which the owner, a Baron
Judica,11 allowed to be Edition: current; Page: [383] seen containing
antiquities found in these ruins, but it seems his property is
sequestrated for his debts & the museum cannot now be seen. From this
summit I saw the eastern sea far & wide, & the celebrated harbour of
Syracuse (though not the town) apparently quite near: with a fine view
also of Etna. The inn is such as I have learnt to think comfortable: but
at the place at Chiaramonte they gave damp sheets, & I could not bring
myself to throw them off & lie between the horrid mattress & the more
horrid coverlet, so I have caught a bad cold in my head—the first thing
of the sort I have had, though exposed to nearly everything that could
give it. In ascending to Palazzuolo we passed through a grove of real
oaks—deciduous oaks—not yet at all green, though the buds seem ready to
burst. But all vegetation is late on these high grounds. I have been
worrying my self with the thought that I have no letter later than the
15th of February—but I have lost no letter by this journey, for the
dates of the latest newspapers at Girgenti shewed that nothing could
have been received of later date than a week after the 15th & you would
not have written again in a week. It is very long to wait till Messina &
yet I do not like to hurry past Catania & Etna & I am afraid to write to
Messina for the letters lest they should miscarry—yet I am inclined to
try.

21st. Syracuse. We started a little after seven & pursued our course
through the same sort of country, only with a constant direction
downwards. The day was not so hot, the scirocco having brought a
considerable quantity of cloud, which however cleared off towards
afternoon. The views we caught of Etna were only partial, clouds
covering parts of the mountain & leaving others visible. At length we
got into what I supposed was the plain of Syracuse; but even this, it
appeared, was an irregular table land, rocky & in great part barren like
the country about Montpellier, which in point of productions it
resembled. Even here the asphodels were not yet in flower but there were
most beautiful earlier flowers especially cyclamens, & a dwarf iris with
large blue, sometimes blue & yellow flowers. When this table land begins
to drop down into the real plain it does so by long gorges with
precipitous walls of rock on both sides, about the breadth of the moat
of a fortified town: some of these are very magnificent to look down
into: we descended into one & went along it for some distance. We
emerged at a little place called Fiorelle [or Floridia?]12 after which
we had about ten miles of real plain, & good carriage road, catching
every now & then most magnificent views of the town with its grand
harbour. The rich & fertile plain of Syracuse is very much larger than
that of Palermo, & is bounded not by mountains but by the highlands I
have just crossed, which though not angular or peaked have a splendid
effect in these fine lights. I had the good luck to Edition: current;
Page: [384] approach the town in a bright afternoon feeling & looking
like the finest July day. The approach was from the side of the greater
harbour, which was calm & glassy, & across it the large white buildings
of the town shone brightly in the sun. You know the town is at present
confined to the island, which was only one of five large quarters in the
time of Syracusan greatness: but even now it looks, & is, one of the
larger towns of Sicily. I do not think there is any town, not even
Athens, which I have so much feeling about as Syracuse: it is the only
ancient town of which I have studied, & know & understand, the
localities: so nothing was new or dark to me. I cannot look at that
greater harbour which my window in the Albergo del Sole looks directly
upon, without thinking of the many despairing looks which were cast upon
the shores all round (as familiar to me as if I had known them all my
life) by the armament of Nicias & Demosthenes.13 That event decided the
fate of the world, most calamitously—If the Athenians had succeeded they
would have added to their maritime supremacy all the Greek cities of
Sicily & Italy, Greece must soon have become subordinate to them & the
empire thus formed in the only way which could have united all Greece,
might have been too strong for the Romans & Carthaginians. Even if they
had failed & got away safe, Athens could never have been subdued by the
Peloponnesians, but would have remained powerful enough to prevent
Macedonia from emerging from obscurity, or at all events to be a
sufficient check on Philip14 & Alexander. Perhaps the world would have
been now a thousand years further advanced if freedom had thus been kept
standing in the only place where it ever was or could then be powerful.
I thought & felt this as I approached the town till I could have cried
with regret & sympathy. The present town is one of the most strongly
fortified I ever saw: it has been made island within islands & when you
have crossed the first drawbridge (there are several) & think you have
arrived, you have to wind in & out through successive lines of
defences—but (as the landlord here said) though there are
fortifications, there are no guns. There is however a large body of
Swiss who marched out as we marched in—I may judge them wrongly, but I
thought I never saw so many bad faces: all that did not look stupid
seemed to have something sinister. In Edition: current; Page: [385] the
course of our windings we got to the smaller harbour, on the opposite
side of the town, & looked across it at the side of the remainder of the
ancient city. I certainly never saw any sea look so deep a blue as the
sea did from this point. The streets of Syracuse are mean looking, the
cross streets vile dirty lanes—but this seems to be, what it has long
had the credit of being, a good inn; though a little Sicilian in some
respects, not like the one at Palermo. When I asked if they had a good
room with a fireplace, saying I had one at Palermo, the landlord said it
was sometimes cold at Palermo but never here. I fear however the worse
evil of gnats, which are buzzing about me. But O the splendor of the
evening view from my window. Down immediately on the greater harbour
over which boats, apparently pleasure boats, were moving—the softest
lights over the plain & highlands; &, to the right, Etna which can be
seen from nearly all Sicily. On enquiry finding there was a diligence
(the mail) to Catania in ten hours, & that it would take my diminished
luggage, I resolved to go by it & to stay in these comfortable quarters
long enough thoroughly to enjoy the place. So I parted from my muleteer
with great good will on my side, & apparently on his—If I go round Etna
I shall miss him very much, but it would be too expensive to keep him on
till then. The last six days, the fine weather part of this mule
journey, have been delightful, but I am not sorry to exchange it now for
going from place to place by diligence & taking walks from the places I
stop at. I shall now write to Messina to have the letters which must be
there sent to Catania, & darling, write next to Corfu—as I shall not
return to Naples if I can get across with any endurable amount of sea. I
can bear the unpleasantness or rather, real suffering, now I have found
that it does not, as I thought in January, do me permanent harm—& every
day saved for Greece, or enabled to be had here without abridging Greece
too much, is worth going through something for. My cold seems going
off—it was very bad for a few hours but has gone through its stages very
quickly. How I long to hear from you. A thousand thousand loves.

My first night at Syracuse was almost sleepless from mosquitoes which
were as bad as they ever were at Nice: but the landlord on being told of
it proposed to put up mosquito curtains, & has done so. On my expressing
surprise at their beginning so early, he said that this wind (the
scirocco) Edition: current; Page: [386] occasionally brings some even at
this season. If it is the scirocco they should now disappear, for the
wind has changed to west, & there have been (though the day was sunny)
clouds of rather a rainy look. The day was spent in going over the
ground of ancient Syracuse with Politi,2 brother of the one at
Agrigentum, who is Cicerone in chief here. I am sorry to say he does not
know his business thoroughly, for he made several great historical
blunders, & is evidently not only an ignorant but a dull man. He talks
some French, but I get on better with him in Italian, for when being
unable to express something in Italian I said it in French, I found he
never understood me. He constantly reminded me of Meynell’s complaint
about the Sicilians, that they never can understand anything—this man
like a very dull Englishman was quite put out by anything like a mot &
could only understand what was said with the utmost literalness. It
would not interest you to go over minutely the historical ground, but I
wonder no one who has written about Syracuse has said anything (that I
remember) about the extreme beauty of the place. Every view of & from
the town is fine; & the view from the heights of Epipolae is one of the
most magnificent conceivable: not only the town, its two harbours, the
sea & the southern highlands, but the other way two most charming bays,
of Thapsus & of Agosta—Catania also, but not visible today from haze
which also hid the whole snowy part of Etna, but for the first time the
whole of the enormous base was visible. The clouds afterwards drew off,
but we had then left the place from which the base was visible. There
are few remains of temples or public buildings but many curious
excavations of tombs in the rock, quarries used as prisons & portions of
ancient fortifications: much however remains to be seen tomorrow. The
cathedral is a Greek temple with columns like those at Paestum built
into the solid wall, & the previously solid wall of the cella hollowed
out into arches: as the moderns must have their colonnade or arcade
inside the temple while the ancients had theirs outside. There is some
most beautiful ancient sculpture, especially two boys supporting the
holy water vessel. The fountain of Arethusa still gives a plentiful
supply of fine water: I do not wonder the Greeks thought it came under
the sea, for it is in the island, & close to the sea. We were rowed
across the greater harbour & up the Anapus (the marshes beside which,
now drained & covered with corn, were fatal to two besieging armies)3 in
order to see one of the curiosities of the place—the Egyptian papyrus
which grows abundantly there, & according to Politi nowhere else, for he
says it is extinct in Egypt. I was wrong yesterday about the soldiers;
Politi says they are all Neapolitans. I thought their uniform was Swiss
& full half of them had light hair. I am glad for the sake of the Swiss
that those faces do not belong to Edition: current; Page: [387] them. My
cold is nearly gone & apparently does not mean to leave any cough; as
you know all my colds used to do. But I am freer from cough or liability
to it than I ever was before I had any pulmonary attack. Evidently the
disease is checked. My digestion however has been very bad all day, but
it was my own fault: the bread here is so good that I ate too much of it
at breakfast. The honey here (I suppose Hyblaean) is very peculiar &
very good. I am sorry to say the Albergo del Sole has fleas, & a cook
who excites my displeasure. I find that I had realized everything at
Syracuse except the immense size of the place (of the Greek town I
mean). The distance from the island to Epipolae, the further extremity
of the ancient town, is very much greater than I had any idea of. I
should say fully three miles as the crow flies. Politi declared we must
have walked at least 14 miles. I am so fond of the place that going from
it to Catania or Messina seems a step downward.

23rd. The mosquito curtains were effectual, for I had no plague with
them in bed, though they were buzzing about my face all the evening—as
they are this evening. The mosquitoes here are remarkably stupid, for
they let themselves be killed with scarcely an effort to save
themselves. Perhaps however it is I who have become more dexterous, by
practice in hunting a more nimble insect. Anyway it spoils the idea of
Syracuse as a place to stay in—to live there one would never think of.
The greater part of today I spent in going about with Politi: there is a
poor amphitheatre, but a theatre (Greek) the largest known, as usual
with a fine view, & with the seats all cut out of the rock: there are
also catacombs, going an immense way underground, with tombs all along,
but the most curious thing by far is the quarries, in which the Athenian
& other prisoners were confined, & which are really most fantastical in
appearance & often very strikingly picturesque—among them is that which
contains the Ear of Dionysius, & one cannot doubt for an instant that
the right place has been found, for there cannot be two places where
there are such extraordinary effects of sound. I did not go into the Ear
itself, to which it is necessary to be drawn up by ropes, but the manner
in which sounds came back magnified from the recesses of the cavern
below enable one to credit any story about its acoustic properties. Two
other quarries have been converted into gardens, one by a convent of
Capuchins, another by a Marchese something.4 The old city all came out
of these quarries & they look as if nothing but palaces can have been
cut out of them. The day was not bright, though very pleasant: there was
a light vapour, over the sky, through which the sunshine penetrated, but
which spoiled the distant views. There was considerably more wind too &
the sea was rather rough. All these particulars of climate are worth
noting. I am a curious object to look at just Edition: current; Page:
[388] now, for besides being more sunburnt than I ever was in my life,
the skin is peeling off my face. Grant5 used to say that a walking tour,
or similar continued exposure to sun & air, always had this effect upon
him, but it never before happened to myself. I have taken a banquette
place for the day after tomorrow, to Catania, & tomorrow I shall wander
about alone. I went out a little way after dinner today, along the great
harbour as far as the mouth of the Anapus. Like, I suppose, almost all
the rivers of Greek history, this surprises by its smallness. It is not
broader than the length of the boat in which we went up it, & is not at
all deep, but is certainly rapid. The town is less mean & poor looking
than I thought it, in fact decent enough, better than Girgenti or
Marsala though not equal to Trapani.

24th. A cloudless day, though by no means brighter than an ordinary fine
day in England. An Italian sky appears to be fabulous, in Italy at
least. I set out on a sauntering walk—partly to get plants, of which I
never before in one day got such a harvest. My other objects were,
first, to explore one of the localities of the siege of Syracuse, the
place where Demosthenes made his unsuccessful attempt on Epipolae—of
which the Ciceroni know nothing. I succeeded in making out the character
of the ground as described by Thucydides.6 Secondly I knew that by going
far enough in this direction I should have the view of Etna which I
ought to have had from the top of Epipolae but was prevented by the
clouds. Accordingly I had it, & the mountain looked like a mountain
indeed. I saw the whole from summit to base—the dark part apparently
about twice the length of the snowy part: but I think this week of fine
weather has considerably diminished the snow. It seems to me that the
snow line is not so low down as it was. But there was also a range of
mountains extending eastward from Etna (or else coming out from behind
it) towards Messina; & to my surprise, beyond & higher than these, was
the toe of Italy, the mountain promontory of Calabria, behind Reggio,
which I had never figured to myself as visible from Syracuse. It looked
large & lofty & though the air near the horizon was anything but clear,
I could see glittering in the sun, high up in the mountain, what seemed
a large white building but no doubt was really a town, though what, I do
not know. The sea between me & it was the darkest slate colour: near the
town of Syracuse it was the deep blue of the first day. Going down to
the cliff on the coast I struck directly & unexpectedly on the Grotta di
Nettuno, a cave in the rock into which boats go as into the Grotta
Azzura: I looked down on the entrance, but could not get in for want of
a boat. In the afternoon there came from the mountains exactly what we
call a sea fog. I at first thought it Edition: current; Page: [389] was
raining violently. But when the fog reached Syracuse it was merely
clouds: it lost even its character of fog.

25th. A very unfavorable day for my journey to Catania, for though the
sun shone all day, there was a haze amounting to fog over the whole
prospect, & instead of having the fine view of Etna & Calabria which I
had yesterday, it was not only impossible to see anything but even to
see that there was anything to be seen. There is therefore less to
relate about this day’s transactions than I expected. The mail was a
coach, well appointed as they all seem, & driven like all coaches here,
with three horses abreast: stout & smaller than English coach horses,
but well made as well as strong. We took about ten hours going: starting
at eight. I expected the whole day’s journey would be over a plain, but
after the first few miles we diverged from the sea, & crossed rocky
ridges & the valleys between them as the mulepaths did. When they do
make carriage roads here they make them well: the slopes are as well
managed as by French engineers & the roads well macadamized. The ridges
were sometimes waste, but oftener covered with olives & vines—the vines
here are putting forth their first green shoots. After a while we slowly
wound up a hill higher than the rest, entirely hid in cactus, at the top
of which is Carlentini, from which we looked down on Lentini at the
bottom (which has replaced the ancient Leontini) & saw as well as the
haze would let us, the lake of Lentini, the largest (if not the only one
at all large) in Sicily. The two towns are uninteresting, & they & the
lake are said by Mrs Starke to be pestilential.7 We climbed a long slope
on the other side of the valley & proceeded along a ridge from which the
view must be magnificent when it is visible: to the right we could
distinguish the sea, to the left a long vista into the interior; in
front the plain of Catania, all flat corn land—though it is only seven
or eight miles broad, I could not distinguish the town; but from this
ridge I made out, through the fog, the now familiar outline of the
globular top of Etna, looking so exactly like the other clouds that if I
had not seen it before I should never have suspected that it was not one
of them. The lower part was entirely concealed by murky clouds, & when
we got into the plain the part I had seen became scarcely
distinguishable & at last altogether invisible. We crossed a
considerable river, the Simaethus, by a ferry & soon got to Catania, but
until within some two miles of the town could not see it distinctly. I
must have lost one of the grandest views in Sicily. The approach to
Catania had on the right, between the road & the sea, what resembled
coal black dunes more than anything else: this is ancient lava, which
has now some vegetation on it. At the very entrance, similar lava
appeared on the left. It was a strange sight, descending a long straight
street, to see everything made of lava: a tall ornamental town gate is
of black lava: the pavement is Edition: current; Page: [390] lava; every
house, except where hidden by stucco, shewed itself to be either built
of hewn lava or of rough lava stuck together with cement (sometimes
alternating with small tiles) & looking the oddest pepper & salt. But
when I got into the main streets & places I perceived that their
ornamental architecture is with white stone, much of it marble. I think
it is a very handsome town, but I shall know more about it tomorrow.
This inn, formerly Abate’s, the Corona, is in a back street, but a
cheerful one (a mistake, the entrance is in a side street, but the house
stands also in one of the main streets).8 As it was Sunday, the streets
were very crowded & lively, like Palermo.—I note as a curious fact, that
when I asked for butter I was told none was to be had—that none is made
at Catania. The butter at Syracuse was excellent: what I used on the
journey the muleteer took with him from Palermo. A propos I never had
any difficulty in getting the finest & richest milk (almost always of
goats), that is, in the morning; at night it was often not to be had,
but the guide usually managed to reserve some from the morning’s stock &
I only three or four times had to drink tea without. Here too there is
milk, though no butter. Honey was offered as a substitute, but the honey
was commonplace, it had not the peculiar flavour of Syracusan. Yet this
I suppose is Hyblaean, the greater Hybla (there are two) being close by.
I have a large room with plenty of furniture & shall be comfortable I
think as long as I stay. Ragusa sent my portmanteau as he undertook, &
it is at the customhouse, from whence I shall rescue it tomorrow.—My
seat outside the coach was rather cold latterly, as I perceived for the
first time at Carlentini that a tramontana had set in. It was lucky that
I had put on my overcoat, though I did so for convenience of carriage,
not from foresight. If Etna looks as high when it can be clearly seen as
it did through the cloud, it is really in some degree like one’s old
idea of how a mountain looks.—It feels odd to be in a real town again.

26th. The fog yesterday & the change of wind had their denouement in a
thunderstorm & torrents of rain by which I was waked in the night; this
morning the sky was brilliant but I found on going out, as strong a
south west wind as the north east was yesterday: It continued fine all
day but does not look such settled fine weather as it did. My first
proceeding was to go out of the town by the nearest outlet, which was
the one opposite to that at which I entered; & have a long look at Etna
from a place by the seaside. Etna however can also be seen down the main
street, which leads directly towards it. I could now distinguish the
woods. In the course of the day, when sunshine & shade favoured, the
numerous small cones which rise out of the side of the lower half of the
mountain formed by various eruptions & from which the most destructive
eruptions have taken place, projected their black forms Edition:
current; Page: [391] very curiously & finely on the body of the
mountain. It looked extremely close to the town; & therefore, doubtless,
not so high as it is: but it looked very like one of the highest Alps
separated from the rest & set down at the Knockholt beeches.9 I observed
a curious optical phenomenon which I do not remember to have seen or
heard mentioned: after gazing awhile on the snowy mountain glittering in
the sunshine, a shadowy form seemed to place itself in the air on the
left side & another on the right, looking like ghosts of the mountain. I
suppose, as after looking at any bright colour the eye sees objects of
the colour supplemental to that, i.e. which makes up with it the
complete white light, so when we have been looking at the white itself
we see its supplement, which can be nothing but colourlessness—shape
without colour. But what shall I say of the view in the other direction,
along the coast! Black lava heaped up in the utmost confusion & reaching
far into the sea. It is a kind of frightful sight, like a vast
exaggeration of an English coal district with the idea of vast natural
power superadded. I did what I had done the first day at Palermo, took a
carriage by the hour to get a general notion of the contorni—it took me
first southward high enough to see a large portion of the lava stream I
saw yesterday on entering—it was the stream of the eruption of 1669,
which destroyed the greater part of the town, & it winds & rolls like a
snake, while it consists of enormous black blocks heaped together—then I
made the driver take me in the opposite direction, north & this was
across nothing but lava, one stream beyond another, sometimes large
blocks, sometimes not larger than the clods of a ploughed field, but
then looking like cinders. The ground is thrown about in the strangest
hills & ridges between the sea & the volcano: they look green from a
distance, but with cactuses, which will grow in the chinks of any rock:
most of the lava is only dotted here & there with vegetation in the
little hollows which of course abound. In the evening I walked & climbed
over a good deal of the lava; it is hard walking, the lava having
sharper points & edges than any other rock. The town I find is almost
all [lava ?] except where it is marble: much of what I took for white
stone is stucco, divided so as to look like masonry: There are a good
many handsome buildings: the cathedral, which is seldom the case in
Sicily, was finer outside than in, particularly fine & imposing in this
light. The chief streets are very gay & cheerful but the unpaved lanes
in which the common people live are very ugly & offensive. The
neighbourhood is full of Saracenic water pillars like those at
Palermo—they do credit to the Saracenic material civilisation but not to
the Saracenic sense of beauty, for they might easily have been made
beautiful, but are prodigiously ugly. Wanting money I called on the Vice
Consul, Mr Jeanes,10 Edition: current; Page: [392] who is also a banker
& Coutts’ correspondent, but he was out, & his people could not pay one
of Coutts’ notes in his absence. I left the letter of introduction which
Oates gave me, & shall return tomorrow. I need to ask his advice about
the way to see most of Etna without climbing it, & the best way of
getting to Messina. I have been very weak today. Yesterday, perhaps from
the hardness of the seat, I was as much fatigued with my diligence
travelling, & am as stiff after it today, as I ever was with a day of
walking & mule riding alternately. My digestion is sadly out of order
again—It is evident that I eat too much & I must take to the starving
system again. That brought me round before, but it did so through an
interval of great weakness & incapacity for exertion, which has made me
hitherto unwilling to try it again sufficiently decidedly—but I think I
must do so. I got my portmanteau from the custom house—they gave a great
deal of bother, unfolded everything, & sent for somebody from the police
to examine the books, which consisted of Sophocles & some botanical &
guide books: he pretended to look very wise while he examined them, but
evidently had not the remotest idea what any of them were, & I
maliciously would not give him the smallest help. I went also to the
post office, though there has not been time to send any letters from
Messina, but I did it to break the ice with the post office people—who
tendered to me a letter addressed to Miss Jane Mills.—There are no
mosquitoes here & I have only discovered one small flea.

27th. A brilliant cloudless day, but I enjoyed it less than I might have
done, from weakness & indigestion: however by abstinence I have made the
indigestion a little less this evening. When I went to Jeanes I was told
(what was not mentioned yesterday) that he is in England: & his
substitute not there but had directed that I should be referred to
another banker as Coutts’ notes can be changed everywhere. The other
banker however refused on the reasonable plea of not being Coutts’
correspondent. I thought it a sign of something wrong: the principal
absent, only one man competent to pay money & that one keeping out of
the way: however I returned about four when the clerk had told me the
manager might be in the house though the bank would be shut. He was
denied to me, but I insisted, saying I was sure he was there, & was at
last admitted, when he told me the house was not in a condition to pay:
in fact had suspended payment. The inconvenience to me will be moderate
because I have enough napoleons to take me to Messina, but gold loses
immensely in the Neapolitan territories for some reason or other—I had
to change several at Syracuse & lost two shillings on each: here I find
I shall only lose about 1s.2d. I had already decided not to go round
Etna, but to go tomorrow to Nicolosi, & climb the small lateral cone,
Monte Rosso, from which the great eruption came,11 & to be satisfied
with what I Edition: current; Page: [393] could see from thence & from
Taormina & the road to Messina—which evidently includes all the best
points. There was little temptation when I was weak & tired to scramble
about the lava, so I spent today in seeing the curiosities of the town.
By far the greatest of these is the convent & church of the
Benedictines, the same which the great eruption miraculously spared,12
as may be read in Dryden & others—& certainly it does look very like a
miracle, for the lava bank or stream, some twenty feet high, goes past
the convent & parallel to it at the distance of not so many feet. The
man who shews the convent candidly said that it was turned aside by a
wall. One realizes by this the viscid nature of the lava, that it should
have flowed at that height leaving a hollow between it & the building.
The convent garden has been made on this lava, & nothing can exceed the
splendor of the view of Etna one way & the sea the other. The convent
itself is a palace—marble architectural staircases & the longest &
finest & most numerous corridors: on my saying it must be very rich, the
man said, tolerably so (bastante), (this is the strongest assent
Sicilians usually give) that its annual income is 20,000 ounces, about
£10,000—Pretty well for Sicily. The church is the finest in Catania, if
not in Sicily, but spoilt by being whitewashed over every part, except
the splendid lavas which decorate the different chapels. I fancy the
Southern Italians & Sicilians admire whitewash because their
associations of cleanliness take that direction—it gives them the
unaccustomed pleasure of seeing something which looks clean. Accordingly
I tried it on with a stranger Sicilian, remarking that it was all
whitewash, on which his observation was, yes, it was perfectly pulito.13
The organ in this church, a magnificent one to look at, is very
celebrated, though made by an inhabitant of Catania:14 it is one of the
celebrated organs of Europe. In hopes of hearing it I went to an evening
service, when however I found it was not played, but instead of it a
full orchestra: the music was certainly good & well played, though too
loud, not for the church but for the voices: & the great echo made the
preacher almost inaudible, though he spoke very distinctly. The church
was lighted with candles which looked like so many stars. Altogether the
effect was fine. I went to the Museum of the Prince Biscari, of his
visit to which & to its founder Goethe gives a pleasant account.15 It
contains a little of everything that ever is in a museum; a great deal
of the usual uninteresting antiquities; & a good many very fine ancient
statues, found in Sicily. I forgot to mention that there Edition:
current; Page: [394] is a Museum, a public one, at Syracuse, the only
remarkable thing in which is a very fine headless Venus. I went to see
the spring which the same Prince Biscari rediscovered under the lava, of
which you perhaps remember the engraving in Bartlett:16 but the
pleasantness of this is only in the idea: it is inside the town: & in
one of the most squalid parts of it, the lava staircase which descends
to it is given up to abominations & the basin into which the water flows
is used as a common place for washing clothes. By way of comment on what
is said of the extreme fondness of the Catanians for this spring, I
remarked that the man whom the landlord sent to shew it to me did not
know the way to it, but had to enquire. The same man took me to a much
finer & perfectly clean excavation of the same kind, & in the same lava,
in some ground belonging to monks to which he said the monks go on
giorni di festa17 to enjoy themselves: if they do they have the very
finest view which can be had in the town for they look clear over all
the houses & see Etna to perfection. The hat I took from England being
quite worn out, I have bought a sort of wide awake18 which the people
here wear as a cappello di campagna19 as they call it: this is better
for travelling, cost only a piastre, & will enable me to postpone buying
a hat till I get to Corfu: if I had bought one here & worn it till then,
it would by that time have been unfit to call on governors with. Jeanes’
predicament prevented me from seeing any Galignani’s, which was one of
the advantages I expected from calling on him; however doubtless the
Messina Oates20 is provided with them. Vegetation here looks almost as
green as it ever does, the few deciduous trees being half in leaf—but as
a general rule, I have observed, neither climate nor an early season
makes half as much difference in trees as they do in herbs & flowers.

28th. Though still equally weak, & having a painful indigestion after
every meal, I made out my excursion to Nicolosi. By the aid of the
waiter of this inn (who is the most complimented person in Sicily by
everybody who writes in a very thick inn book) a carriage was hired for
two dollars (plus a buona mano of 1s.4d). The day at first seemd bad for
the view, as a thick sea fog obscured the coast. The road which rose
rapidly to Nicolosi passed over nothing but lava; some of the lava
however was old, & having crumbled into the black dust we know so well,
is, I dare say, very fertile soil. But I confess I greatly prefer a
Neptunian country:21 water & gravitation combined are much pleasanter
agents in forming a country than fire. I prefer waving lines,
interrupted by large fine crags & precipices, to these sharp, sudden
fractious Edition: current; Page: [395] rapid ups & downs of black lava.
Catania is not a place for walking—there is no getting out from beneath
ugly walls made of piled up fragments of lava looking like cinders:
generally however one can see over them. In the approach to Nicolosi,
the various minor cones which stand out of the mountain side, become
more & more distinct: the Monte Rosso which I climbed & which is close
to Nicolosi is the nearest but one, & one of the largest, much the
finest & most conspicuous from Catania. Like nearly all the others it
has like Vesuvius two summits, a crater being between: I do not see why,
as I should have expected a circular ridge with one outlet. These
craters only serve once, none of them remains open after the eruption
which formed it: the crater at the top of Aetna is the only permanent
one. I took a guide from Nicolosi—The climbing was hard work, as much of
it was through loose ashes, & if it had not been really a very light
undertaking, I think I should have given it up: but I knew it would do
me no harm after it was done, so I persisted. The mountain is nothing
but a large deep crater, a smaller one close to it, & the wall which
supports them: at the top you stand on a narrow rim or ridge. Though it
cannot have taken more than half an hour climbing, the height was
sufficient to make the very uneven country I had crossed from Catania,
appear a flat, in which the newer & blacker lavas looked like the dark
shadows of clouds. The day, though it never cleared completely, had
sufficiently improved to make a most splendid view: the coast to
Syracuse; Lentini, its lake & the south eastern range which I so lately
crossed; a wide extent of sea; inland a whole sea of mountains towards
Palermo: across the sea a clear view of the upper part of the Calabrian
mountains, the lower being still obscured by clouds: nearer, we looked
down upon the lower region of Etna & up to the higher: being still at a
considerable distance from even the woody region which by the way does
not as one fancied form a continuous zone round the mountain, but is
much more sparse as the Americans say. The guide said it is three hours
of horse riding to the top of the bosco & seven hours to the top of the
mountain (from Nicolosi) of which only the last one need be on foot: it
looks quite easy, the slopes nowhere very great & it must be easy when
there is no snow, which the guide says is the case in summer. The snow
already shews points & dots of black rock. The black marks I noticed
near the top seem to jut out from the outside walls of the crater, of
which the interior outline could be very well distinguished from this
point. In the large broad spread out slopes from the foot of Monte Rosso
to the commencement of the bosco, there is much cultivation but the only
building I saw was a Benedictine convent, connected with the one in
Catania. The excursion altogether occupied 7½ hours, from half past
eight till four.

29th. Giardini. The waiter, Placido, found a voiture de retour for
Messina, which would take me & my goods in two days for seven dollars,
tolls & buona mano included. This was as little as I could expect.
Finding however that the Edition: current; Page: [396] organ at the
Benedictine church22 would be played today I would not go till I had
heard it. It is a fine but not extraordinary instrument: & the organist
introduced numbers of airs from the Trovatore,23 the opera now in vogue:
at least so said a neighbour of mine in the church. I started at half
past eleven, & arrived at this little place, Giardini, at the foot of
the mountain of Taormina, some time before dark. The day was splendid, a
slight tramontana not sufficient for cold, but producing the contrary
effect to that of yesterday, the sea being now clear, but clouds about
the upper part of Etna. These did not completely draw off all day but
tant mieux: they heightened the effect. The road, between Etna & the
sea, passes considerably nearer to Etna than Catania is, & the base of
the mountain is also steeper: being in the shade, too, & the upper
visible ridges below the cloud many of them nearly horizontal, the
effect was that of a gigantic wall, of the length & height of a range of
mountains. At last, between Jaci Reale24 & Giarra, the clouds divided a
little & the head of the mountain appeared, & I can now say that I have
once seen Etna looking grand. The height seemed really vast, & to climb
it something quite beyond possibility; as no doubt it is, from this
side. The sun shone brilliantly on the snow & was reflected from it &
from the white clouds which still hung about the shoulders of the
mountain, shewing enough & hiding enough to make the effect such as I
could not have supposed from all I had seen before that Etna ever could
produce. This day’s journey, the latter part of it at least, would even
without Etna be one of the most beautiful I ever went. The sea was of
every beautiful colour the sea can have, from deep blue to light grey:
the Calabrian mountains, though very much obscured by clouds during the
greater part of the day, were seen clearly towards evening of a very
light grey colour: & a little beyond Jaci we came in sight of a
beautiful range of mountains, coming out from behind Etna, quite to the
sea, & then along the coast towards Messina. Several towns & villages
were visible on salient high points of this range, & among others
(rather low down on the mountain side) Taormina. Between this range &
the heights which are the limit of the northern slopes of Etna, such a
vista of a mountain valley! how I should like to explore it—& I would do
so but I wish still more to see Greece. The northern part of the island
is the most beautiful—it must be a delightful three days journey from
Messina to Palermo by Cefalù, on the north coast. This day’s route was
across lava, but soon got into old lava which had crumbled on the
surface into the black powder. The people here will not admit anything
to be lava which did not proceed from some known eruption, though it
only needs eyes to see that the substance is exactly the same. It is
very richly cultivated & fertile. The flax fields here are many of them
out of Edition: current; Page: [397] flower, & fit to cut, while others
are coming into flower—of course sown later. The barley fields are all
in ear—there is much barley grown, as they give it to the horses & mules
instead of oats. I passed some deciduous oaks, on which the new green
shoots were oddly mixed with some remaining leaves of last year, not
even turned brown. We crossed one of the usual plains, that of Naxos,25
the earliest Greek town in Sicily destroyed, I think, by Dionysius, & of
which the inhabitants built Tauromenium some way up the mountain side
for better defence. We then reached Giardini, a poor village close on
the beach, but with a decent inn, & I shall climb the hill tomorrow
morning. Two places we passed through were remarkably neat looking for
Sicily: these were Jaci Reale, a town of some importance with a handsome
cathedral & churches, & Giarra, just on the descent into the plain. I
should have enjoyed this still more but for my indigestion, which is as
bad as ever: but I shall stay at Messina till I conquer it, even if by
not eating at all. I have not felt quite so weak today: This day there
was some, though not much dust: you remember how we were obsédé with it
at Naples in February—this year, today is the first day I have had any.
Mosquitoes the last two nights: not many the first, but enough last
night to have made curtains desirable. However they did not keep me
awake. I was obliged to have a box made at Catania to hold the plants.

30th. Messina. Taormina is quite the finest thing I have seen in Sicily:
I mean the view from the theatre: the theatre itself, though more of it
is preserved than of any other Greek theatre I have seen, is worth
little in comparison. The point in the mountain side which had been
chosen for it is a projecting, angular point, immediately over the sea:
& on one side you see the coast to Syracuse, & Etna, on the other the
range of mountains to Messina, the coast of Calabria & the Faro. It is
quite in vain to attempt to describe it—Etna had a cloud on the very
top, but both the gracefully sloping snow-covered shoulders were visible
& as seen from here they slope symmetrically—& though the slope is
gentle & the base looks vaster from this than from any other place, it
does not make the height appear less, as might be supposed, & as I
expected from the views of the mountain which I had seen. The other side
was not less fine: the day though sunny & almost cloudless was hazy, &
the Calabrian mountains were but dimly seen: it is remarkable that I
have lost wholly or partially more fine views in Sicily by clouds or
haze than I should have lost in England at the same time of year: so
much for Italian sky. But the nearer objects, & what was seen of the
more distant, were an ample compensation. The mountains close at hand
also afforded a very pleasant view of mountain greenery. I should have
enjoyed Edition: current; Page: [398] this perfectly but for an extreme
feeling of nervous weakness, which did not prevent my climbing the
mountain nor make me feel tired afterwards but made every step a labour
& an oppression: nor were my sensations improved by the prolix talk of a
custodi, who was unusually well versed in details & bored me with them.
The road to Messina was all the way a beautiful Riviera—the mountains as
high & as close to the sea, but the alternation of mountain & plain much
more rapid & the plains very small—so that sometimes the broad flat bed
of the torrent filled a great part of them. By degrees the sea narrowed
into the Faro, & the Calabrian highlands became distinctly visible—they
appeared indeed close at hand: their summit line is nearly strait &
horizontal but they are so high that on the highest point, almost
opposite Messina, there is snow. We passed Reggio which must have a
splendid view of Sicily & Etna, & arrived at Messina, happily in time
for the post. I found two of my darling’s letters— the one she first
wrote to Messina, before she had written to Palermo at all—& her second
to Palermo, which that post office had faithfully forwarded here—this
gives me news of her a week later than the one I received at Palermo.
These the Messina post office had not sent to Catania—& I am in a state
of painful uncertainty whether or not they sent any. However I shall
strive to find out. I am in hopes from her letter that she soon got rid
of the remainder of the illness she had on first returning home. How
like H.26 that going off to America without paying—it is of a piece with
his general conduct, than which his conduct in money matters has
generally been better. You will tell me about the Bideford people27 when
we meet. I will not darling feel anxious again about letters as I see
they are so liable to miscarry. In my last I asked her to write next to
Corfu—I shall write again before I leave Messina, but I may say now,
after receiving this write once to Athens, & once again to Corfu as I am
sure to go back that way. I have to find out here what will be my wisest
way of getting to Greece. I may however stay here longer than I
intended, to get my stomach into order. I have now for several days
eaten much less at breakfast, & nothing at dinner but a very moderate
quantity of macaroni & milk, which seems to agree with me better than
anything else—this morning I had hot milk instead of tea because instead
of requiring bread it does instead of it; perhaps that was partly the
reason I could not keep from dropping asleep in the carriage every
minute in spite of the beautiful scenery: the same thing happened
yesterday but not to the same degree. However my two daily indigestions
have been much less violent today than yesterday—I came to the reputed
best inn here, the Vittoria, but would not stay, because the landlord
did not choose to let anybody dine, even on macaroni, except at his
table d’hote—& did not have Edition: current; Page: [399] the honesty to
say so at first, but his men told me lie after lie & kept me for an hour
waiting in the belief that the macaroni was coming. So I had an
explanation with the landlord (a dandified young German) & walked off.
The inn I am now in is a very good one apparently, & looks, like the
other, direct to the Faro & Calabria. The whole breadth of the coast
which Calabria presents to Sicily hardly exceeds in length the base of
Etna. From this place you see round the west corner of it, & see part of
the west coast of Italy. It looks very inviting & I should much like a
mule journey from Reggio to Otranto or Brindisi but I suppose there are
not even such inns as those of the south of Sicily. I found a long
letter from Hill,28 as usual most friendly for which I must give him one
in return. And now my precious precious love, the lovingest good night.

This morning when I took No. 36 to the post I had the displeasure to be
told that the mail only goes once a week & went yesterday—so that you
will probably get this letter as soon as that. I saw another post office
clerk, apparently the superior of the other who told me positively that
they had not sent any letters to Catania. They seemed to intend to do it
some time or other: I called on the Messina Oates2 with my letter of
introduction or rather was going to call on him when he was pointed out
to me in the street. I introduced myself, produced my letter & found he
was going this very day into the country—he offered anything he could
do, said he would call on me, & did so. From what he told me, & the
enquiries I in consequence made at the Austrian Consul’s, I found that
the Austrian Lloyd steamboat goes direct to Corfu tomorrow, for the last
time, being about to be taken off the line, & that there is no other way
of getting to Corfu or Greece, except round by Malta or by Naples. As
this steamer professes to go in 34 hours I should have much more sea
going by Malta, & as much by Naples if I go there in the steamer,
besides the long & expensive land journey to Brindisi with all manner of
difficulties about luggage, as the mail (the only diligence) is limited
to a very small quantity. Therefore, although I wished very much to stay
a few days here & also to wait for another letter from my dearest one,
the reasons seem Edition: current; Page: [400] so very strong for taking
advantage of this opportunity that I have made up my mind to go. Judging
from the last experience, the seasickness, wretched as it is at the time
& for many hours after, does not do me permanent harm as I thought it
did before: it is true I must expect a rough passage, as a violent wind
has been blowing all day—a south east wind, which the people all thought
would bring rain, & which did bring a cloudy day, but the clouds were
partly blown away in the afternoon & I could see sunshine though none
came where I was. Messina is a rather handsome town—the two principal
streets, the Ferdinanda & the Corso, are nearly parallel to one another
& to the quay which forms a third—they are broad & neat, & the houses on
one side of the Ferdinanda look to the quay. There are some other
tolerable streets. This town has no plain, like most of the others, but
quite touches the foot of the mountains, which though not high just
close to the town are very crowded & peaked. I took a walk for several
hours among them & got into quite mountain scenery, with continual views
continually varying of the Faro & the opposite coast of Italy. The Faro
is longer than it seemed at first, though the Calabrian coast soon turns
northward; the corner of the island for some distance bends round,
crescent wise, to follow it, making the celebrated promontory of
Pelorus, apparently a narrow tongue of flat land with a town or village
on it. The Faro in its least wide part looks only like a broad & very
fine river & if you conceive this flowing between splendid mountains,
varied by headlands & bays, you are as near the fact as any description
can make you. The beauty seemed of a most enjoyable kind & I enjoyed it,
for I had not the same nervous weakness as yesterday—though weak at
first I got on pretty well. I had my two daily indigestions but in a
mitigated degree: and I may as well stop to cure myself at Corfu as
here. The cathedral here is like all the cathedrals in Sicily. They are
all large, all on the same plan, viz. the form of a basilica, therefore
with two side colonnades much lower than the nave serving as aisles, & a
semicircular apse at the end—but with a transept superadded, which forms
no part of the plan of a basilica, & which some of the finest churches
at Rome have got, e.g. S. Maria Maggiore. They all have a dome over the
point of junction of the cross. Most of them have columns taken from
some Greek temple or basilica (this has them of granite). Most have
marbles or lavas, more or less fine. With all this, very few have any
imposingness but that which size gives.—There is more shipping here than
at any other port in Sicily, & the French steamers pass here on their
way to the Levant. Oates said that this is a very healthy place & never
had the cholera last year when it killed 22,000 people though it only
lasted ten days. It is much the coolest place in summer, of all Sicily:
the sea breeze is so cool that those who live on the Marina sometimes
have to shut their windows even in summer to avoid chill. There are
mosquitoes, but chiefly in autumn—He says Sicily abounds in bugs, of
which I have seen Edition: current; Page: [401] none: but by his account
summer is the time when they flourish. Some of the inns in the interior
are, he says, quite as bad as Spain. I do not know whether I think this
place or Palermo the most beautiful—but Palermo is the better of the two
for winter & this for summer.

April 1st. In consequence of the rough weather, the steamer has not come
in & therefore cannot leave till tomorrow at the earliest: but I gained
nothing by the delay in opportunity of seeing the country, for it has
rained soakingly from an early hour of the day. There is also a great
deal of wind. I am very glad not to have started in such a rough sea, &
equally so to have a chance of a letter before I go, for the mail is
expected tomorrow. Pourvu que the bad weather does not keep that back
too. I went to the Cathedral for the Palm Sunday service but left before
it was ended. The music was very poor. I passed the rest of the day in
putting in order my great accumulation of plants, & in reading Dante &
the Handbook for Greece. Nothing is more likely to keep off seasickness
than filling my brain with an exciting conception of what I am going to:
I think I shall do in Greece the contrary of what I have done in Italy,
that is, I shall take what opportunities I may have & even seek
opportunities of conversing with the educated class of natives. I am
curious about the mind of the leading people of Greece & feel that I
have almost everything to learn about them. Doubtless my introductions
to Finlay3 & Wyse4 will give me opportunities, & going in the first week
in April I shall have a good deal of time. I am obliged to ménager the
books I have with me to make them hold out. I am keeping Sophocles for
Greece. Theocritus & the two minor Sicilian pastoral poets, Bion &
Moschus, I have finished, & like the two last much better than the
first, whom I think greatly overrated, & quite inferior to his imitator,
Virgil. I have written to Hill.5 Not having received any letter from
Pope6 I fear he has been too unwell to go abroad at all—or else he had
left before my letter from Pisa reached London, & so has lost all trace
of me & I of him. But I would now much rather make the tour of Greece
alone, i.e. with a guide like my muleteer from Palermo, which I find by
Murray is the proper way of going about in Greece. A companion must be
very good if he is, to me, better than none, & besides the botanizing
would be a bore to almost any chance rencontre of the kind unless he
happened to be a botanist too.

2nd. The wind has calmed down, & changed, in the middle of the day to
the opposite quarter; nevertheless the steamer has not yet come in.
Unfortunately neither has the post from England. I succeeded this
morning in getting weighed, for the first time since Naples. It was done
by a pleasant man who makes & sells weighing instruments. Oates (of
Girgenti) explained to me the mystery of the rotoli:7 it is the Sicilian
rotolo, which is 1¾ of an English pound: the rotolo of Naples is 1/7
more than that of Sicily, & is therefore two pounds. So that when I left
Naples I weighed 10 stone 7 lb, being only 1 lb less than at Avignon.
This morning I weighed 80 Sicilian rotoli, i.e. exactly 10 stone, just
what I weighed when I left London, though 7 lbs more than when I left
Rome. It seems I am never to get beyond 10 st. 8 lbs. I oscillate
between that & 10 stone. That was the highest I reached in my last
summer’s excursion & the highest I have reached in this & I have lost it
all. But there is nothing in that discouraging, for it is accounted for
by eating less, & being unable to digest as great a quantity as I then
could. I feel getting better: I think the peculiarly bad indigestion of
the last week has been owing to the bread of the country, especially as
at Catania I could not get butter, which to me is I believe necessary to
make any kind of bread wholesome. Here I get the ordinary bread of
Europe, made with soft wheat (as at Palermo) & though I do not like this
nearly so well, the indigestion it gives is acidity, which comes soon
after eating, goes away in an hour or so & leaves me feeling very well,
while the other (of which toasting does not correct the unpleasant
properties) does not acidify, but in four or five hours I have a mass of
far more uneasy sensations of indigestion & never feel light & healthy,
as I do now for the greater part of the day. I think I shall soon be as
well again as at Naples. I was in nearly my full strength for walking
today & walked many hours. I started, in a tolerably fine morning, for
the great point of view of the place, the telegraph, which is on the
ridge of one of the highest of the near mountains: unfortunately rain
came on before I had got far, but I persevered in hopes of a lucid
interval & saw just enough to see what I had missed: I had a peep of the
northern sea over a field of mountains, & the telegraph man said if it
was clear I should see all the Lipari islands (Stromboli, Volcano &
all). I went a great deal further, partly through the rain clouds; it
must be most exquisite scenery, all of it, quite the finest region of
the island I have been in. After I had nearly got back to Messina the
day cleared up a little & I could see the Calabrian mountains, all but
the highest tops: they were of the loveliest purple & rose colour, that
is the front ones rose colour (owing to the colour of the soil) & the
higher ones behind them purple. I have seen no fine effects of light
since Palermo till these except the afternoon of the day in which I saw
the temples of Girgenti. The sunny hazy weather I have had so much of is
not favourable to these effects. The telegraph Edition: current; Page:
[403] man admitted that Sicily is foggy, because he said it is so far to
the south, a curious inversion of our notions. The Oates here said (in
answer to a remark of mine) that when people talk of an Italian sky he
thought they must mean in an Italian summer: in June, July, & August,
the sky is always cloudless—when clouds would be agreeable. The sky of
Greece I think must be clear: people rave so about its clearness,
especially in Attica, & about the wonderful beauty of the effects of
light & atmospheric colours. I shall soon know. Messina would be on some
accounts the best place in Sicily for us to live in: it is I think still
more beautiful than Palermo, & there is more life in the place, more
foreigners come there & it is practically much nearer to England &
France owing to the English & French steamers to Malta & the Levant
which do not go near Palermo: it is strange therefore that there should
be but one post in a week & I suspect there must be ways of sending via
this or that in the intervals. Oates says the Galignani reaches him,
sometimes, very quickly, by the French steamers. But I do not think we
should like to live in so stagnant a place as Sicily, where one falls a
month behind in news if one has not one’s own newspaper & meets no one
who knows a single European fact. I however like the common people here
very much, & the middle class too. Most of them will cheat you or rather
overcharge you if you let them, but I have not met with one instance
(except the master of the Victoria who is not a Sicilian) in any rank
who has not been perfectly civil & desirous to oblige. It is true their
curiosity is equal to the American, but they have no idea that so
natural & universal a feeling requires to be suppressed. Even the
officials I have had to do with are not insolent & presuming (as they
sometimes are in other parts of Europe) & this even when they do not
expect you to give them anything.

3rd. The steamer has even yet not come in, & as there is no bad weather
to interfere with the 15 hours passage from Malta, the people at the
office suppose it has waited at Malta for the steamer from Liverpool
which may have had bad weather. They take letters from Malta & England
to Corfu but not here, though they come here—because there is no postal
treaty. Bad management somewhere. The post from England, via Marseilles
has come in, & brings no letter. My hope therefore must rest on the post
office people here & I hope they will be more faithful in sending
letters to Corfu than to Catania. As soon as I had ascertained the state
of the case I set off to walk to the other great point of view, The
Point, viz. Cape Pelorus—The road, a good carriage road, is along the
beach, round a large crescent, the mountains to the left declining into
little hills & ending at last in a flat projecting triangular point
forming the angle of the island, & this point curiously enough has a
lagune in the middle of its triangle. There is a second lagune a little
nearer to Messina. The day soon after I left looked more threatening
than Edition: current; Page: [404] promising: though it did not rain
where I was, the cape was immersed in violent rain & it was pleasant to
watch the successive black showers pass along the Calabrian coast,
covering & then abandoning successive headlands & bays. At last I saw
the fine weather coming across the cape, as the rain had done before, &
it became a beautiful sunny afternoon: though heavy clouds never left
the tops of the higher mountains. There is a village at the point & the
lighthouse in the very angle at the further end of the village & this or
near it is the point of view—which I should be very sorry to have
missed. You see both coasts of Sicily, the angle of crowded mountains
which lies adjacent, & the Calabrian coast to a great distance just
round the great bay of Palmi, also Stromboli, Lipari, & a great many
more islands. The strait is here the narrowest, apparently very narrow,
& immediately opposite is Scilla, exactly as I recalled it in Lear8—the
rock in front, the town on a greater height behind & the little bay to
the right of both, with the mountains behind. Considering how subject
the country is to earthquakes, the disappearance of Charybdis is not
surprising, but if it was, as the ancient poets represent, off this
point, to pass between it & Scilla may have been with some winds & at
some times of the current, a little difficult & troublesome. I enjoyed
it much, though surrounded by begging boys, the most obtrusive &
persevering of all beggars, who called me signor capitano twice in every
sentence they uttered: they seem to call all Englishmen capitano, I
suppose, because so few Englishmen came until lately except in trading
ships. I have been several times so addressed: but here the whole
village had their mouths full of it, wishing, in return for the
bajocchi9 they wanted me to give them, that I might always have a good
voyage with my ship. Perhaps the wide awake helped to give that idea. I
have had very little indigestion today, & my stomach is certainly
getting better. The quay here is not so fine as is represented, though a
part of it is neat stuccoed houses with balconies to all the windows,
four stories high & pillars stuck into the wall. It is not comparable to
the quays of Rouen, Lyons or even Nantes—but then the view! The town is
a great length in this direction, having a long faubourg along the coast
at each end—& the Strada Ferdinanda must be a mile long, but there is no
breadth, owing to the mountains. There is a French ship of war in the
strait & this inn is full of Frenchmen; there were (the waiter told me)
35 of them today at the table d’hôte, and they make a great noise in
this previously quiet house. By the way in the inn at Catania there were
three nightingales in cages, & one or more of them occasionally sung
beautifully.

6th. Corfu. At last darling I have the pleasure of writing to my one
precious one from this place: but I must take things in their order. The
steamer came in the morning while I was at breakfast, & the agent
hurried me on board with all my roba as the Italians call things in
general, but when I got there at half past nine it appeared that it was
not to leave till 4 which turned out to be 5. So as it was a fine day I
employed it in going again to the telegraph. It was an hour and a half
brisk walking, all climbing & the last half hour very steep. The view
was indeed splendid: the whole north coast (which the Greeks called Calè
Actè, the beautiful shore) as far as the long mountainous promontory
which bounded the view this way from Palermo—so that though I have not
travelled along this coast I can say that I have seen all of it. Six of
the Lipari isles (& more could have been seen if the day had been
clearer) among others Stromboli—the effect is curious of these little
cones, sometimes like Stromboli blunted at top, dotted about the sea
which they rise directly out of. About the middle of the visible part of
the coast, a long tongue of land projecting into the sea, & on its
isthmus the beautifully situated town of Milazzo. Inland, ridge behind
ridge & height behind height shewing the excessive beauty of the whole
north of the island, which if either Goethe or Mrs Starke had said
anything about I certainly would not have given up my original intention
of travelling this road. It is a most beautiful carriage road too; it
winds over this very mountain, & I returned by it. There is a carriage
road which passes just under the telegraph forming a real corniche for a
cornice should be at the top, not the bottom—no part of the Riviera road
is a real cornice except between Sestri & Borghetto. This beautiful
corniche joins the road from Messina to Palermo by the north coast, at
the sixth milestone (seven English miles) from Messina, & its corkscrew
windings continue the whole of these seven miles: it is a fine piece of
engineering & I should think must be about the most beautiful seven
miles of carriage drive in Europe: the greatest variety of views of the
Faro & the Calabrian coast, all round to the vast distance to which it
was visible the day previous from the cape—When the view turned the
other way it looked to the tops & into the hollows of mountains about
the form & height of the higher ones at Nice, but much more crowded. The
views towards the sea are finer than either those at Nice or the descent
to Spezia, the Faro & its mountains being finer than even the Gulf of
Spezia. The weather now suffered me at times to see again the snowy
summit of the mountains opposite. The whole of these miles of road are
planted on both sides with trees (still young), a spreading kind of
poplar, & our common acacia: in the higher mountainous part these are
still looking wintry; in the lower they are in full green, the leaves
quite ductified, though not so large as they will be (some acacias near
the beach the previous day were coming into flower) & mixed with them
now & then a Edition: current; Page: [406] judas tree in the full
richness & abundance of its flesh coloured flowers which astonished me
by their gorgeousness. It was a delightful last day in Sicily, & I was
very glad of the delay which enabled me to have it.—The steamer is a
wretched one, large & good looking, but of only 60 horse power—& how we
did creep along. It seemed as if any row boat could have passed us. Some
Englishmen on board seemed to think the captain no better than his ship.
Instead of 34 hours it took 48. It was dark before we got clear of the
Faro—I then went into my cabin (a good one) & did not leave it till we
were in the channel of Corfu. By lying quiet I kept off sickness till
the afternoon of the next day—it was not so bad then as in either of the
other voyages, & by the following morning actual sickness had ceased.
The first time this ever happened to me—in consequence I have not had,
since landing, the horrible sensations of sickness I had at Genoa &
Palermo the day of arrival. This although it was a very rough passage, &
the passengers say an actual storm the second night—those who were on
the windward side of the ship were rolled out of their berths. I was
luckily on the leeward & only felt the ship roll very much—perhaps I was
asleep in the worst part of it. The captain at one time thought he
should have to run into the Gulf of Taranto & reach Corfu by the north
instead of the south channel. I was on deck soon after we entered the
channel, but it was a hazy day & I did not see it to advantage. The
mountains of Albania are not so high or so fine as I expected, & the
south part of Corfu itself though angular & rocky looking is quite low:
but the north channel is always said to be the fine one. The town itself
looks very fine indeed, from the sea it is at an almost right angled
turn in the channel, built round the two sides of the right angle, with
the very finest looking imposing castle rock I ever saw, exactly in the
corner: the town itself looks (from the sea) quite prepossessing,
seeming to combine English neatness with continental height &
architectural effect, & the immediate neighbourhood looks green, a
colour I have not seen before since I left England (except in the upper
region of the Messina mountains, where there is real grass, dotted over
with the tree heath & a beautiful broom). At the custom house they did
not even open my boxes. I found the inn said to be best, quite full. My
luggage was at the very bottom of the hold & came up last so all the
others were beforehand with me. I am at one which looks as good, the
Hotel de l’Europe, but in a very tiny room; however I am promised a
better at latest on Monday. This is Good Friday, but I suppose not so in
the Greek church as they calculate Easter differently: but there was a
grand procession by torchlight, which passed along the Esplanade just in
front of the porch, of the details of which I could see little, but the
music, wind instruments, a band of Greeks in fine dresses was really
good, & the archbishop & priests looked very dignified & in very fine
dresses. Among the passengers was one militia officer (you know the
militia have come here to do garrison duty), Edition: current; Page:
[407] several English travelling for amusement who seemed noisy
schoolboys—how noisy the English are when they get together abroad—but I
made the rencontre of a botanist, a Mr Perry,10 who lives in the south
of Ireland, & of a well educated young man named Joyce,11 who after
tutoring for some years at Oxford grew tired of that & got an
appointment in the commissariat, as total a change I should think as
ever was made—he is to be posted to Cefalonia or Zante, for five years,
& has brought lots of fresh books & of the English poets to be his
companions for that time—consequently he & I have a good many topics of
conversation, but I am afraid he will leave tomorrow. He is in this inn.
I shall cultivate the botanist, & win his heart by giving him plants &
helping him otherwise, for he has no proper books with him & I have: Sir
H. Ward12 I find is just going: his successor expected daily. However I
shall send my card & Grote’s letter tomorrow morning.—It is a curious
thing that this time after the seasickness I had in a most exaggerated
degree the sensations which indigestion gives & which I am accustomed to
call acidity—though the stomach was entirely empty when the sickness
began & I fasted entirely for more than 48 hours. I supposed of course
that this was an irritation of the stomach, caused by acidity & caused
also by seasickness—but Joyce without my having mentioned the subject at
all, advised from his own experience taking soda after seasickness,
because (said he) there is acidity to be arrested & soda takes it away.
Odd, is it not? what can the acidity be? a secretion from the stomach
itself? My indigestion had almost entirely left me the last day at
Messina. We shall see if it returns here. I was obliged this evening to
eat not what I would have chosen but what I could get. It feels very odd
to find English money used, & the people speaking English, French, or
Italian: in general I understand their Italian best. The Greek faces are
very noticeable already. I feel now beginning my travels again. I wonder
if Greece will really be finer than Sicily. In the ennui of the ship I
passed over in my mind all I have seen, & felt that the pictures I have
carried away from Sicily are a perfect treasure of recollections for as
much longer as I live—Palermo & Monte Pellegrino, Trapani & Eryx, the
ruins of Selinus, Girgenti, Terranova, the views from the south eastern
range, all the views of Etna, & more than all, Syracuse & Messina. And
the places that can be gone to in a carriage are the finest—I should
like to see them again with her. The view from Taormina is an exception
for that unfortunately is not carrozzabile but perhaps it will be made
so as there is a decided impulse towards road making. Living in Edition:
current; Page: [408] Sicily however I do not think would suit us.
Perhaps Corfu would do better. We shall see.

7th. Better this morning than I have been a long while. Another
procession has just passed. I do think the Greek church manages these
things better than the Catholic—the costume of the priests too is much
more imposing—the long hair of the young ones, the long beards of the
old. I was much struck with the deadly paleness of all the Greeks—not
sallow or brown like Spaniards or black like Portuguese but white. Greek
features seem confined to a few of the lower class—the middle are, here
at least, ugly, & like any of the meaner races of Europe. I am just
going out & shall put this in the post as it goes tomorrow early via
Trieste, so I shall only say that this town as I see it from the window
of the salle à manger at the top of the house, seems the most beautiful
& the most cheerful I ever was in, so with this cheerful piece of
information I say adieu for the present my beloved one.

I am charmed with this place—although I have seen it today through so
thick an atmosphere that the distant objects especially southward are
scarcely visible. But it has been a sunny day, only too hot, like a fine
July day with us. The town instead of occupying the two sides of a right
angle as I thought, occupies three sides of a rectangular promontory:
one side looks down the channel, one across the channel, & one
northward, which would be up the channel if the channel were
straight—but is much better, viz. across a large broad bay, the whole
opposite side of which is formed by a ridge of mountains most
beautifully shaped & in their highest part apparently as high as those
of Calabria seen from Messina—these are called the mountain of San
Salvador & there is a procession to the top of it on the day of the
Transfiguration. The apparently narrow channel flows east of this
mountain & so gives to all of the sea that is seen from that side of the
town the appearance of an inland lake. On the only remaining side, the
west, there are two inlets of the sea, so that the town is almost on an
island. South west there is another beautifully shaped mountain though
not nearly so high. In that direction you Edition: current; Page: [409]
get to rich meadows covered with buttercups, then to groves of old
beautiful spreading olives with rich green pasture under them instead of
corn, & as there are no fences you can go all over the island freely—you
come to splendid points of view. But the town itself is delightful.
Along the south side of it, just within the castle rock, is the
Esplanade, a space of green grass (at this season) planted with trees &
partly laid out in a half shrubbery half flower garden, of which the
most prominent feature was thousands of fine geraniums half as tall as I
am, in full flower—The trees are all green, even a walnut tree coming
into leaf. The two principal inns & the best houses look out on this
esplanade, which at both ends meets the sea, except that the eastern end
is partly occupied by the Government house or Palace as they call it,
which looks like a very pretty Calcutta garden-house—the ground floor a
colonnade at the top of a flight of steps, one long suite of apparently
fine rooms above that, & one row of smaller windows still higher. When I
saw this I still more envied the post of High Commissioner here. I left
my card & Grote’s letter early in the morning, & went to buy a hat &
look about me & when I came in I found a letter from the Chief
Secretary, Bowen,3 saying that Sir H. Ward would be happy to see me
tomorrow if I would call, & regretted that the confusion of his
household, as he starts for Ceylon on Thursday,4 prevents his shewing me
the usual personal attentions—meanwhile he, Bowen, also knows Grote, has
much of the Logic almost by heart, would call this afternoon & hoped I
would breakfast with him tomorrow. I had heard of this Bowen from Joyce
who though much younger knew him at Oxford & says he distinguished
himself there, was a Fellow of Brazennose [sic] & he told me afterwards
himself that he was sent out here by Lord Grey to organize a University
& was here several years after which the D. of Newcastle5 wanting a
Colonial Secretary looked out for someone who knew the place & the
people & made choice of him. He turns out to be the writer of the book
called Mount Athos, Thessaly & Epirus.6 He came, & went out for a walk
with me & Joyce & shewed us some beautiful points of view among which I
recognized the one chosen by Lear7 in which St Salvador groups Edition:
current; Page: [410] with the Acroceraunian mountains on the opposite
coast: he also shewed us what remains of temples &c. there are, which
are scanty, as there have been few excavations. He says nothing can
exceed the beauty of the island & that I can have no idea of it from
what I have yet seen. He seems a scholar & an instructed man. He says
the English are not popular here though Ward whom he likes exceedingly,
is so. The people of all ranks both in these islands & in Greece want to
be Russian—or rather their grand wish is a Greek Byzantine empire under
a Russian prince—in his opinion none except a very few instructed
persons care about democracy or a constitution, the sympathy of religion
is all in all with them—they say it is their religion which has kept
them a people—that but for it they would have been absorbed by the
Moslems which is true. He likes the Greeks however, says nothing can be
more absurd than the way in which the English generally run them
down—that they have exactly the qualities & defects of their ancestors.
I asked him about the safety of travelling in Greece as one of the
passengers in the steamer had heard reports of its being unsafe. He said
it is utter humbug—that it is exactly the same now as at all times—that
he has travelled in Greece more than any other Englishman & in all parts
of it & never found or heard of the smallest danger though he was told
all sorts of bugaboo stories even by consuls all of whom, & even Wyse,8
want always to make out a case against the Greek government & when
Palmerston was at the Foreign Office9 were expected & required to do so.
Besides he said the way is to engage one of the Athenian guides who for
about a pound a day will undertake all expenses & you need carry no
money at all—he, Bowen, once went from Athens all over Greece with only
two zwanzigers in his pocket & brought one of them back—it is then the
guide’s business to keep out of danger & he always knows how to do so.
Bowen therefore encouraged me to go to places I should never have
thought of going to without such advice from a person who must have the
best means of knowing. The outskirts of the town, usually so untidy on
the Continent, are here as neat as in an English country town—more so
than the native part of the town itself which is like a small town in
Italy, with arcades in some of the streets & a good many English shops.
I went about the thronged market place looking at the faces—I saw very
few with what we call Greek features, that is the Greek ideal, but
hundreds of heads & faces like those lithographs of Palikari10 which we
used to see everywhere at the time of the Greek revolution. All, of
every rank, except so far as they are sunburnt or weatherstained, are of
that deadly white I noticed at first. The provisions on sale were
beautifully white rice & salt, a curious looking white cheese looking
halfway between Stilton & cream cheese, many different Edition: current;
Page: [411] vegetables, coffee, oranges, also macaroni & other pastes &
a brown sort of bread. The processions last night & this morning were in
honour of St Spiridion11 [sic] who is the patron of the island & whose
poor mummy they carried in procession & I sat in his church & watched
the people come up in a stream to kiss with fervour the case which
contains it (the mummy—not the church) & after multiplied crossing
themselves & bowing sometimes quite to the ground, take their departure.
This however is also Easter, which this year happens accidentally to
coincide with that of the Latin churches, & they have been firing sudden
jerking stunning explosions of small cannon all day in honour of it,
which are censé to be fired at Judas Iscariot. A more ugly incident of
the feast is that the town resounded in the morning with the bleatings
of unfortunate lambs, which later in the day might be seen sacrificed,
one at the door of each house, & in the poorer houses a cross made with
the blood over the door, & sometimes on both sides of it too—so much
that is Jewish remains in the Greek church—the long beards of the
priests & the vestments of the prelates are also Jewish. The churches
here do not seem very numerous & have little tall square towers like the
north of Italy, which is quite a pleasure to see after those tiresome
domes. Inside, to make amends for the absence of images, the two I
entered are crowded with pictures, & if these are a sample, I must say
there is great exaggeration in what is said about the stiffness produced
by adherence to a conventional type—they are infinitely freer & more
handsome than the Italian before Giotto, & remind me most of the early
Venetian painters before Titian & his cotemporaries—as one would expect,
the Venetians having had so much to do with Constantinople & having no
doubt borrowed much of their painting as they did of their architecture
from it. This place, Bowen says, is much less Greek than the other
islands, being more Italianized: the higher classes even talk Italian
among themselves. It was the official language till within a few
years—Greek is so now. The names of the streets are still Italian. The
inscriptions on the shops are often Greek & English, often Italian &
Greek. The money of the island is dollars but the small change is
English money, & they calculate in English money but in shillings, not
pounds, the Spanish or Mexican dollar passing for 4s.4d & other dollars
for somewhat less. Dollars are also one of the common coins of Greece.
This is a very pleasant inn & the provisions excellent—only too
tempting.

8th. The haze of yesterday resolved itself about midnight into violent
rain, with some thunder, & today it has rained nearly all day, so that I
have seen little new. Is it not curious how the rain follows me
everywhere? Though Edition: current; Page: [412] here every one tells me
I have come exactly at the best season. It seems doubtful if I shall
have weather while I stay for the three excursions which Murray says are
de rigueur if one wants to see the beauty of the island. A propos I soon
found that Bowen must be the writer of Murray’s Greece, for he kept
telling me things which I had just read in Murray. I breakfasted with
him in his very nice rooms & took the opportunity of asking him about
the eligibility of the place for living in, telling him my reason for
being interested about it—that either my wife’s health or my own, or
both, might very possibly make it desirable for me to fix in a southern
climate. He gave the greatest encouragement—said it had often surprised
him that so few English settle here, that it can only be because the
advantages of the place are not known. He said the common idea of the
English here is that you can live as well on £600 a year here as on
£1200 in England, but that quiet & economical people can do much better:
for instance his predecessor12 as Colonial Secretary told him he never
spent more than £500 though he had several children & kept a carriage &
two or three horses. He asked me if I should like to be Resident of one
of the Islands—saying that the work does not take above two hours a day
to an energetic person as he has not to govern but to review the acts of
the native government, all of which must be submitted to him in writing
for his sanction—that the pay is £500 a year & a house, or rather two
houses, in town & country, that the appointment is not with the Colonial
office but with the Lord High Commissioner who is always eager to get
better men than the officers accidentally in command of the troops, whom
he is generally obliged to appoint for want of better & whose
incompetence & rashness some times go near to drive him mad—that either
Cephalonia or Zante will be vacant within a year; & that they are not
bound to any representation except that they give a ball to the chief
people of the island once a year on the queen’s birthday & a dinner to
the members of the native government about twice a year. This is
tempting, now when I see how much pleasanter at least Corfu is than most
of the places we could think of going to: & if Ward had been going to
remain I could probably have had the place for asking. The new man13 is
the son of an India director14 but my having known him, as he died under
a cloud, would not I suspect be much of a recommendation to the son.
Bowen introduced me at the garrison library, the only place here where
one can see English newspapers & periodicals—there Edition: current;
Page: [413] I learnt for the first time Hume’s death:15 if all did as
much good in proportion to their talents as he, what a world it would
be! also that Lewis16 is Chancellor of the Exchequer & Vernon Smith17 at
the India Board: this last I suspect will give me a good deal of
influence there. At one oclock I called by appointment on Sir H. Ward:
he was extremely & pleasantly civil, talked sensibly about Turkish &
Russian prospects & about these islands which he extremely regrets
leaving (in conformity to official routine) for another
appointment—thinks Greece in a decidedly disturbed state & advises me to
be guided by the advice of Wyse of whom he seems to think very highly—&
ended by asking me to dine with him tomorrow en famille, which
considering that he is to sail on Thursday, was certainly a greater
degree of attention than he was in the least bound to shew. Bowen gave
me two pamphlets of his own,18 one of them on the politics of these
islands—a rather clever & on the whole practically sensible piece of
political controversy but which shews no wider or better or more liberal
ideas than the more liberal kind of Oxford people now universally have.
If it is fine tomorrow I have fixed to go one of the three excursions
with the botanist, Perry, who I am told is a great traveller & also a
great yachting man: I do not much like him, but it is agreeable to get a
companion to share the expense of a carriage who instead of being a
restraint on botanizing, extremely desires some one to join with him in
it. I like Joyce—he is a good specimen of a younger kind of Oxonian,
seems very desirous to get ideas & is also well acquainted with the
Logic.

9th. The rain went off before morning & the day became gradually fine. I
had first a botanizing walk with Perry to a place called the One-gun
battery (though there is no battery there now) in a most beautiful
position overlooking the mouth of an old harbour (now a shallow salt
water lake connected by a channel with the sea) & commanding the whole
south coast of the island, & part of Albania. After this I went with him
& two other fellow passengers in the steamer who are travelling with
him, on a carriage excursion, one of the three recommended in Murray,
over part of the highest mountain south west of the town, to the top of
a pass just over the sea on the Adriatic side, in a ridge from which you
see the whole of the view both ways. The details of the scenery going &
coming are more beautiful than I Edition: current; Page: [414] can
possibly describe—like the very finest things in Sicily & Italy in
everything else, but having in addition a rich green from the flowery
pasture which covers the country under the old olive trees—besides which
the cypresses have that peculiar effect which one has often seen in
views of Greece, something like but far exceeding the effect of a
Lombardy poplar standing in front of a bank of trees, & where there are
many they make the place look like a Turkish cemetery. The sparkle of
the sea waves in the sunlight at this place can be compared to nothing
but raining stars into the water. But what most struck me was the return
view of the Albanian coast. I never before so completely realized what
one loses here by a hazy day. The evening lights brought all the objects
on the Albanian coast south of the island into prominent relief, & where
I had seen only a rather tame mountainous coast I now saw deep openings
going far into the interior, between ranges of mountains overlapping one
another, & the peculiar disposition of ridges & angles with which views
of Greece & Albania have made us familiar but which I never saw anywhere
before in nature: the distant mountains north west from Nice as seen
from the heights are something like it on a much smaller scale—& every
ridge, every angle in a different light from every other. The town also
even from the least attractive side, the land side, looked charming. The
place grows upon me as all fine places do, but more than any other place
I ever saw—Everybody here, I mean all the English I have spoken to, say
they have felt & continue to feel the same, & the three English I went
out with were as enthusiastic in their admiration of it as I
was—especially Perry who says he shall certainly come here again next
spring. He appears to be a man of fortune, unmarried, about forty, & to
delight mainly in travelling & gardening, naturalizing foreign plants &
so forth—a handsome man with a long narrow head & face, dark complexion,
& decided Irish intonation. He is going to Athens & from thence to
Constantinople. The new High Commissioner Sir J. Young arrived this
morning, amidst firing &c, whereupon I thought it right to send a note
to Bowen to, in fact, release Sir H. Ward from receiving me at dinner,
saying that a stranger would be de trop, but received in return a more
pressing invitation, so went & dined at seven o’clock with both the
Governors, the remaining persons present being Lady Ward, a ladylike
invalidish looking woman, two daughters & the husband of one of them a
conversible military man aide de camp or something of the kind, Col.
Lawrence19 the head of the police, who seemed the most capable person
there, though with an impediment in his speech, a young chaplain & some
youthful sons & daughters. The dinner was partly continental, partly
English, including the largest boiled turkey I ever saw & some good
roast beef—the only good beef since Montpellier (to be sure I have
seldom tried the beef but never found it good). Sir J. Young seems a
well bred quiet parliamentary Edition: current; Page: [415] sort of
English gentleman, not at all Irish & not at all like a whipper-in of a
ministry, which he long was. He said he hoped he should see me again
before I leave Corfu. I gathered what information I could about the
country—they say there are about three months of heat almost equal to
the West Indies, because the sea breezes are not so regular & so much to
be depended on here as there—but even then you can go out in the sun if
it is to do anything, & if mind or body are occupied & strung up—but if
you lounge, you are likely to have fever. The town & most parts of the
country are healthy & free from malaria. The cholera has never been here
though it was once in Cephalonia. Mosquitoes in some years a good many,
in others few or none, except in marshy places. There are hardly any
books to be had here (bought, I mean, there are some good ones at the
Garrison Library, & others at the University, given by Lord Guildford20
& others), no map of the island except one made by Lady Ward, no views
of the fine scenery except her drawings: the Corfiotes, unlike the
Greeks generally, very indifferent about reading & improvement. By the
account of all these English they are quite Orientals as to lying &
corruption—the judges bribeable; & perjury in courts of justice
extremely common or rather always procurable by those who can pay for
it—which however they attribute very much to the abominable government
of the Venetians who used to send out the ruined nobles to recruit their
fortunes here, from whom even licences to murder your enemy might be
bought for ready money. Before I left rain had again come on: a great
bore, but my usual luck.

10th. It rained much in the night, but in the morning it was fine after
one shower, & I set off with the same party on the longest of the three
carriage excursions recommended by Murray—to an old monastery called
Paleocastrizza on the west coast of the island, 16 miles from the town
of Corfu. The road began as if we were going round the great bay north
of the town—until we seemed almost close to the foot of the ridge of San
Salvador: it then went for some miles through a splendid forest of old
olives, with green pasture under them & often as much brushwood & shrubs
as in the more open kind of English woods: of which much is ilex,
myrtle, lentisc & other evergreens, but there are also quantities of
judas trees, hawthorns in full fragrance, green brambles & much else. At
last we emerged on the top of a pass & descended from it to the seaside
passing & overlooking what seemed an endless succession of rocky coves
with deep-blue water such as I have seldom seen in the Mediterranean. I
cannot describe the beauty & variety of the forms of rocks & mountains,
the aerial tints, the glimpses of more distant views across the gulf,
which we had both in going, & still more in returning, Edition: current;
Page: [416] when distant objects were seen with more perfect transparent
clearness than I have seen them in all this journey. Nevertheless almost
ever since dark it has again rained violently. The character of the
vegetation on the two sides of the pass differed nearly as much as on
the two sides of the Appenines, the side towards the town being much
less southern in character than towards the Adriatic, on which side also
there was much less of the characteristic green of the island. If this
green did but continue through the summer instead of drying up by June,
the island would really unite the advantages of all climates. As it is I
think it decidedly the most beautiful & agreeable little bit of our
planet that I have yet seen & I do not at all expect to find anything
better in Greece.

11th. The weather seems to have entirely broken up. It rained today not
constantly but too often & too much for even a walk except about the
town. I read books which I had got from Bowen, occupied myself with the
plants, helped Perry with his, read at the reading room, called on Bowen
& promised to dine with him tomorrow with the new High Commissioner. I
had intended this day if it had been fine, for the finest excursion of
all, which I had put off because no day yet has been fine enough for it.
But it is doubtful now if I shall see the great view, or even have fine
weather for the Gulf of Corinth. The place is full of soldiers: a third
regiment of militia has arrived this morning for garrison duty, yet they
continue to send here from England regiment after regiment of the
regular army. Yesterday a frigate came from Constantinople which is to
take away one regiment, but the weather is not good enough for them to
sail today. This inn is clean, well kept & comfortably furnished, but
the rooms are small & noise anywhere can be heard all over the house.
There are larger rooms at the other inn, Carter’s; the Glub (not Club)
Hotel. It seems a very poor place for shops, perhaps they are better
than they look. But for neatness & cleanness no town I know in the South
can compare with it. The worst is, the heat in summer & rain at other
seasons—for Col. Butler21 the aide de camp says that he has found during
his residence here a great deal of such weather as today. The Greek of
inscriptions over shops, affiches &c is scarcely distinguishable from
the ancient. In fact it is the ancient with a few vulgarisms, which they
are gradually getting rid of. I go continually to the post office though
I did not much expect a letter yet. I have told the Messina post office
to send on the letters to Athens & have written to the office at Naples
to do the same—& I suppose I shall not get your letter to this place
except by leaving word to have it sent to Athens. But letters to Athens
will reach me for a month to come, for while it is the first place in
Greece I shall go to, it will also be the last, all excursions being
from it. Therefore darling please direct there till further notice,
especially Edition: current; Page: [417] as letters get there very
quickly via Trieste—sometimes in six days if they hit the twice a week
Austrian Lloyd steamers exactly, & if these have a good passage. Now on
beginning the last stage of my journey I necessarily begin to think
practically of getting home—is there any chance that my dearest one will
be able & inclined to meet me at Paris, Strasbourg or any other of the
places we talked of? If she could & would, how very delightful it would
be—& do not think that it would abridge my time in Greece, for my leave
of absence was in the terms of Clark’s certificate, for eight months, &
even if these are counted from the grant of leave & not from my
beginning to make use of it, this would extend to the 15th of July, so
that we could in that case prolong the holiday at least till then. I
shall certainly not outstay the month of June if doing so implies a
longer separation, but I should feel quite differently if we were to
pass the additional time together.—The Greek consul here to whom I took
my passport today to be visé, says that one can safely go to any part of
Greece that is worth going to, only it is well to go in a party of three
or four & keep together.—I have written a short note to Peacock22
entirely about classicalities.

12th. Violent rain in the night & another showery morning: but I shall
brave it by a long walk & then return to see the ex Governor depart. As
tomorrow morning is post time & I may not have much time this afternoon,
I shall close my letter now so adieu my own precious love. I shall write
immediately from Athens.

Yesterday morning darling I had the happiness of getting both her
letters together, the last of as late a date as April 2. The earlier one
must have been here all the while, only the stupid man could not read
it; I hardly expected one until today but if I had not received one
today should have insisted on looking over the letters myself. I do not
think many letters have miscarried—I am not sure of any but the one at
Naples: many however have reached me late, & not at the place to which
they were directed. I do not wonder that such a terrible winter should
have given you an illness. Thank heaven it is over—the illness & the
winter too—& though the last letter does not say Edition: current; Page:
[418] how you are, the handwriting & its being in ink are encouraging.
Respecting the dangers of travelling in Greece, my precious one will
have seen by my last letter that I am quite attentive to the subject, &
shall not run any serious risks. I shall be guided by Wyse who must know
the state of the country. You might well say that some other person’s
savoir faire was wanted “in addition” to mine—I could not help laughing
when I read those words, as if I had any savoir faire at all. The
English I have been going about with here are all going to Athens & some
of them perhaps about Greece—if so we shall have a party ready made, &
all the English one meets here are the class of experienced travellers.
Perry seems to have gone almost everywhere, & a Mr Prebble,2 just
returned from Egypt, is still more practised—the other two are young
men, one a nephew of Sir Frederic Hankey3 who was colonial secretary
here, the other & pleasanter named Bruce:4 the young men are nullities,
the other two not clever but tolerably & only tolerably well informed.
All know a little ancient Greek, none much except Joyce who remains
here—none know any modern Greek, but Prebble speaks French, German &
Italian capitally. They all however talk of going to Constantinople but
if they do I may very likely find at Athens still better companions. The
regular guides taken from Athens are by all accounts quite trustworthy &
clever at avoiding or getting through scrapes—the three good inns at
Athens belong to three of them, so they are responsible people.—To
resume my adventures—as happened at Girgenti, the moment I had written
to you about the bad weather it ceased. The 12th was a beautiful day & I
walked with Perry to the village of Pelleka, seven miles off through the
olive forest on the top of a hill, having the best view of the town of
Corfu & its immediate neighborhood & a splendid one of the Albanian
mountains, which now covered with a great quantity of freshly fallen
snow—(the more remote ridges I mean, with the nearer ones standing out
dark in front of them) are brought quite near, & are one of the most
magnificent spectacles I ever saw: but I had them still more finely
yesterday in the great excursion to the pass of Pantaleone across the
range of San Salvador. We had waited for the finest weather & today it
was a real Corfu day, as splendid as the scenery. The pass commands one
way all the objects which I had seen before in the island; & the other
way what I had not seen at all, the northern division, separated from
the rest of the island by this range—& several smaller dependent isles—&
from a position a little below the pass on the north side, the range of
the Acroceraunian mountains with their fresh snow—anything like this I
never beheld. All the views of Greece & Albania in Lear5 & Edition:
current; Page: [419] Wordsworth6 bear only the relation to it that a
sketch does to a finished picture. The best attempts of landscape
painters to imitate those tints are merely a faint shadow of the
reality. Yet in returning when I saw again the southern Albanian
mountains with one of the range of Pindus behind, as snowy as Ætna, all
illuminated by the most glorious sun, & the strait between of the colour
of a strong solution of vitriol, & the beautiful foregrounds which this
island always gives, I thought it equal to the view from Pantaleone; &
still more when I went out a little before sunset & saw it from the sea
wall in the evening lights.—Sir H. Ward was to have gone on the 12th,
but the Alexandria steamer from Trieste did not arrive soon enough & he
went yesterday morning at 7. I paid my respects to him as many others
did before his departure (on the afternoon of the 12th). One of his
parting acts was to send me a little Homer as a present because when
they were all talking to me of the beauty of Ithaca I had happened to
say I wished I had revived my recollections of the Odyssey before
coming. On the 12th I dined with Bowen to meet the new governor—there
was not much good talk but I heard some Greek songs sung to the guitar
by the writer & composer who wrote many of the songs sung in the Greek
war of independence.7 The music was very good but completely Italian
except one song which was almost Spanish. He sang well, and thus united
the three offices of the ancient bard. There were a Mrs & Miss
Wodehouse, staying with Bowen, the wife & daughter of Col. Wodehouse,8
lately resident in Ithaca & now going to Cefalonia: Bowen speaks of her
as a very cultivated & strong minded woman who knows the Greeks better
than almost any one & is more the Resident than her husband is—I saw
nothing very particular in her, but it was pleasant to see an English
person who had been in Corsica & Sardinia about which she talked more
than about Greece. Bowen afterwards renewed the subject of the
Residentship, said that Zante will be vacant this year: that it will be
offered to Wodehouse & if he takes it Cefalonia will be vacant & that he
is almost sure Sir J. Young has no one to whom he wishes to give it &
seemed very desirous that I should think seriously about it. I told him
I had not made up my mind to leave the India house but might very
possibly be obliged to do so & that this opening would be a strong
additional inducement. As one dinnering leads to another I found myself
in for another dinner with Sir J. Young, yesterday: the only persons
present were the Regent of Corfu (a Count something)9 & Col. Butler. I
learnt a good Edition: current; Page: [420] deal & so did the Governor
from the Regent, about the statistics of the island & had some talk with
Sir J. Y. about the taxes. I was glad to see so much of him in case we
should think in earnest about coming here. I do not believe there is a
more beautiful place in the world & few more agreeable—the burthen of it
to us would be that we could not (with the Residentship) have the
perfectly quiet life, with ourselves & our own thoughts, which we prefer
to any other, but if we have tolerable health there is not more of
societyizing than would be endurable & if we have not, that would excuse
us. This morning is the day for going to Athens, but the steamer has not
arrived & I cannot tell when we shall get off. And now I must be off to
take leave of Bowen & do some other matters.

Same evening. The steamer is not arrived yet & now will hardly leave
tonight if even it arrives. When it appeared how the matter stood I set
off with the same party for another excursion, to a place called the Ten
Saints, a chapel on one (though not the highest) summit of the mountain
south west of the town: the second highest mountain in the island. You
will understand that in these carriage excursions there is much
walking—& the cost among so many is trifling. The view both ways, but
especially towards Albania was very fine, & part of the Acroceraunian
group shewed itself over the pass of Pantaleone. But a great deal of the
snow on the mountains has already melted & the view though always fine
has lost some of its splendour—it was only when the late afternoon &
evening lights came on it that it was again unrivalled. This country is
the only one I ever saw where the peasantry seem really idle: you see
them in groups lounging in the sun in the beau milieu of the day, or
sitting in a circle, often playing at cards—even children do so.
Meanwhile the country is not half cultivated: the olives, always a lazy
crop, are here not even pruned, & the frequency of late frosts makes a
good season very rare—Col. Butler has been here six years of which five
were bad crops & one only middling. The vines, about which alone some
pains seem to be taken, now fail: yet the island does not grow grain of
all sorts more than enough for a third the consumption of its scanty
population. These islands raise more than £20 000 a year revenue by a
tax on imported corn. The only thing the country people seem to be
occupied with is conveying horse loads of green forage along the
excellent roads.—I am impatient to get to Greece now, having seen this
island thoroughly & so as never to forget it: & it has seemed to me
always more & more charming. All however say that the climate is
extremely variable, much rain, a good deal of cold, & intense heat for
three months. The post office here makes difficulties about forwarding
letters to Athens unless they are paid for, but Bowen bids me tell them
to send my letters to him & he will send them on under Wyse’s
cover.—Bown Edition: current; Page: [421] tells me that Reeve10 is
editor of the Edinburgh! it is indeed fallen. Who will consent to have
his writings judged of, & cut & carved by Reeve? For us it is again a
complete exclusion.11

18th. Athens. It has taken three days to get here & I can hardly believe
that I am here at last, though the three days have seemed like one very
long one. A great part of it has been spoiled by the weather, for the
rain pursues me here as it has everywhere else. However enough was left
to make it very beautiful. The steamer came in the night of the 14th &
on the 15th (Sunday morning) it set off about half past nine, but from
its being en retard did not stop as is the custom both at Cephalonia &
Zante long enough for passengers to land, nor at the Isthmus long enough
for them to go to Corinth. Patras was the only place at which we
landed—But to take things in order—We steamed down the channel between
Corfu & the mainland of Albania, in a very fine day though less clear
than the two preceding days, which were themselves far from clear.
Greece hitherto has had no more of clear sky than Italy, & Prebble says
as far as he has observed the Mediterranean is not clear between
Christmas & the middle of April but he expects it to become so now. We
passed Cape Bianco, the southermost point of Corfu, conspicuous by its
white cliff. Further on the islands of Paxos & Antipaxos make a
continued line with Corfu, & I hoped we should have kept the channel &
passed between Ithaca & Cephalonia, but this is only done in bad
weather. Argostoli the capital of Cephalonia is on the outside of the
island, & as we were going to touch there we passed between Paxos and
Antipaxos (two islands covered with olives but otherwise dry & bare)
into the open sea. The coast also here recedes, past Parga, towards
Prevesa & the Gulf of Arta & there was thus a great corner to cut off.
This should have been the finest view of the coast, but heavy clouds had
gathered over the mountains of the interior, & we only caught a brief
view of a small part of the main snowy range of Pindus. South of the
Gulf of Arta we were soon abreast of the island of Leucadia or Santa
Maura, another of the Ionian isles, named from the whiteness of its
rocks—it forms first a high mountain, then a long ridge towards the west
& we saw from a great distance Sappho’s cliff looking very like Beachy
Head,12 sharply cut out, but with a long rise & slope above it. The wind
gradually Edition: current; Page: [422] rose as we came in sight of
Cephalonia & towards dusk I was a little sick, but went to bed & it went
off, & I was not ill again in the next two days of narrow seas. We
passed Argostoli in the night & soon after daylight were in the bay of
Zante. I got up & saw it in the fine morning light, & most beautiful it
was. A broad round bay with the town spread along the side of it, &
mountains behind, something like the views of Macao. The place looked
neat, with nice north Italian campaniles & there is a very beautiful
mountain at the outer horn of the bay, but it was still finer as we
receded from it & were able to take in more of it at a time—the long
range or almost ridge of mountains extending from the town, which is far
south to the northern point opposite Cephalonia. We had now for the sake
of touching at Zante, gone far south of the Gulf of Corinth, & had to
turn again northward & pass between the islands & the coast of the
Morea. To the left we had Cephalonia & Ithaca, the highest mountain of
Cephalonia being next to us & this is one of the finest mountains I have
yet seen & the play of light on it was most exquisite. The western part
of the Morea (Elis & Messenia) is very flat but even the flat parts of
this country have marked features and the snow tipped mountains of
Cyllene in the north western part of Arcadia were conspicuous beyond it,
& far to the south east we could see the mountain of Navarino: by
degrees, behind the long point on which is Castel Tornese (built by the
crusaders soon after 1200). The vale of Elis opened itself out, & facing
us were the scattered rocky isles of the Echinades, many of them now
joined to the mainland of Acarnania by the great deposits of sand
brought down by the Achelous. But as we passed these, a violent storm of
rain formed itself over the mountains of Acarnania & Ætolia: we had to
go below & saw nothing. It was still raining violently when after
entering the outer Corinthian Gulf we put across & halted off Mesolonghi
on the northern coast: I went on deck but could see little. When however
in our zigzag course we reached Patras on the southern side, it was
again fine weather. We here landed, & looked about us. The nearer slip
of land between the mountains of Morea & the gulf is even narrower than
I had imagined & what there is of land is by no means plain, but lower
hills & slopes. We climbed to the castle & to another height above the
castle. The mountains of Ætolia on the other side of the gulf were most
exquisite. Patras is a very neat, quite new looking town—all the houses
looking as if just built which indeed is the fact, both here & at every
other town of Greece. The main street goes directly uphill from the sea
& is more like an oriental bazaar than a street—it has arcades on both
sides, a broad unpaved straight road; the fronts of the shops open & the
men in their motley Greek costumes sitting, often oriental fashion, on
raised boards at their work—many of them busy making their gaily
ornamented clothing. The place looked thriving in spite of the failure
of the current Edition: current; Page: [423] vine which is said to be
its principal dependence—but these little Greek ports do an immense
quantity of trading business all over Europe. There is a little port,
Galaxidi, higher up the gulf, which maintains I was told nearly a
hundred small vessels by carrying coals from England to Constantinople,
Athens &c. After leaving Patras we soon passed into the inner gulph,
through the narrow passage between two narrow tongues of land in which
are the little ports called the Castles of Rumelia & of the Morea. It
was dark soon after & as it was a cloudy night & no moon we lay off
Vostitza or Ægium till half past two the next morning. I got up at five
to find a rainy morning & all the finest part of the Corinthian gulf was
in a great measure hid from us during the remainder of the day, which
however gradually cleared, with occasional showers, very like an April
day in England: we went up the bay of Salona which from the green
mountains which bounded it, much resembled Switzerland or the English
lakes: at the end of it begins the valley (known as the Crissean plain)
which leads up to Parnassus & Delphi, & Parnassus ought to have been
visible but was quite hid: further on however we saw at times parts of
it through another opening, but never the summit. We continued, seldom
seeing more than one side of the gulf uncovered at a time; & never the
tops of the high mountains—but the lower mountains in front were so
perfectly lovely that we could afford to lose much. The mountains on the
north side were generally more peaked, those of the Morea more flat
topped but which were finest I cannot tell—We endeavoured with what
helps we could get to pick out Helicon, Cithaeron &c. but could get
little help on board for it is astonishing how ignorant these people are
of their own country. We never got much information but from the captain
of the steamer on the other side of the isthmus who told us those
localities very well: he was a Hungarian from Fiume & a very efficient &
pleasant fellow. We had many Greeks on board, among others, Colicotroni,
son or nephew of the hero of the revolution13 and who also distinguished
himself in it—he was going to Athens it was said to answer for something
he had done. He gave us some information but could speak only a very
little Italian & French. The Lloyd company has made a road over the
isthmus & sent us over it in carriages—it is about an hour’s drive or
less, all the most beautiful green waste—we passed over it with the
Acrocorinthus on our right & half a dozen other similarly framed rocks
beyond, only differing from it in not being visible from so far off on
the eastern side.—The mountains beyond, range above range, were the most
splendid that can be conceived & the weather often Edition: current;
Page: [424] allowed us to see them although there was often a gust of
wind & an April shower which hid them for a time. The other steamer took
us down between Ægina & Salamis to the Piraeus where we arrived just
before dark, seeing, for some time previous, the Acropolis & the
neighbouring hills right before us—the coast of Argolis past Poros quite
to Hydra & Cape Sunium looking like an island far out at sea. Piraeus is
a freshly whitewashed, quite new German looking town. We took a carriage
& drove to Athens in the dark & put up at a very nice large clean inn,
the Hotel d’Angleterre, kept by Elias Polychronopoulos14 one of the
famous guides. I have not attempted any description of this route, for I
felt all along that it would be quite in vain. You have seen good views
of the finest things in Greece & they do not a bit exaggerate while they
cannot give one tenth of the beauty. I shall feel bewildered in the
midst of it for days. It will be very mortifying if I am not able to go
about Greece. Everybody is talking of banditti who infest the Isthmus
especially, who once robbed the mail, & even broke into the Government
treasury somewhere & took away a large sum of money—it is said the
irregular soldiers disbanded by the present ministry have turned
robbers. Elias, who runs the chief risk if there be any, says there is
no danger at all—that some English are touring in Greece at this very
time—that the brigandage is all against the government & they do not
molest foreigners—which quite agrees with Bowen. He says he will give me
a guide who will take me anywhere & will answer for perfect safety. I
shall hear Wyse’s opinion & be mainly guided by that. I suppose none of
the English who have travelled with me lately will remain as they are
all going to Constantinople. Prebble undertakes to make the bargains for
us & it is rich comedy to see him do it—though neither clever nor a
gentleman he always carries his point by a mixture of reason,
determination & bad jokes which keep the enemy in good humour—he gets us
through wonderfully cheap & we are to pay here only nine francs a day
each for everything. Murray says ten shillings. It was a rich scene
between him & Elias, who is a complete Greek, immensely insinuating &
cajoling, officious beyond all reason, & who hugged & embraced him
nearly all the time, ending with a most furious embrace. I was not able
to write last night without sitting up too late, & today I must finish
as the post goes out this evening. I shall try to give a better account
of Athens in my next than I have given of the way to it. I hope by that
time to have got my nerves a little more quiet & shall be able to tell
you my plans. Be sure I shall not go anywhere without the fullest
assurance of its being safe. I am now going to the post with this, & to
ask for letters, then to leave my card & letter of introduction with
Wyse, then to the Acropolis. Adieu with a thousand loves.

Dearest—

I have just returned from Wyse. I left my card & letter of introduction
yesterday, & today on coming in I found his card, & he sent his Greek
servant to invite me to tea this evening—I went, & found a considerable
party of diplomates, officers &c—& their ladies, a niece of Wyse
presiding2—for his wife,3 one of the Bonapartes, lives separate from
him, & a daughter with her. He is pleasant, well informed & talks
intelligently about Greece & he introduced me to the French minister, a
M. Mercier4 (I think he called him) who is but lately arrived here, &
who talked very sensibly about France & England, but of course is a
Napoleonist par état. I was very happy to find that Wyse, though in
Bowen’s opinion something of an alarmist about the safety of travelling
&c, is not at all so in the present case, but takes exactly the same
view of the matter as the landlord here (if I may call this
slash-sleeved embroidered jacketed, cotton-kilted, ornamental gaitered
flying about active young looking Greek by so humdrum an expression). He
says, in the first place there are no brigands in the Morea, nor
scarcely anywhere except about the Isthmus. In the next place, they do
not molest travellers, least of all foreign travellers—they are simply
making a factious opposition to the present ministry, by robbing the
mails, breaking into treasuries & so on. To use his expression, they do
not rob travellers but villages. This coming in confirmation of Bowen &
of the landlord puts me quite at ease, & I shall start for Delphi &
Thermopylae as soon as I have seen Athens. I take that part of Greece
before Peloponnesus because the one is a definite excursion, the other
an indefinite which may be prolonged or shortened as time allows &
therefore should come last. I shall look out however for a companion, &
have some prospect of one in the form of a young Englishman who has
petitioned to go to Marathon in the company of our party as I may call
the accidental conglomeration of fellow travellers that has come
together at Corfu & here. I have made good use of the two days I have
been here: yesterday I saw almost all the antiquities & went today to
Eleusis. I have Edition: current; Page: [426] already got quite into the
feeling of the place—With regard to scenery it is hitherto rather below
my expectation, very inferior to Corfu & the Corinthian Gulf, the
mountains though otherwise fine being arid & bare, & very like those of
the south of France, while the peculiar beauty of this place, the bright
& pure atmosphere, I have not had—both these days though sunny having
been extremely hazy, so that I did not see the mountains half as well as
on the rainy day of my arrival. Wyse says that Lord Carlisle5 had the
same ill luck, & only had before his departure a few days of the
brilliant weather. Nevertheless the view from the Acropolis was
splendid. The temples rather surpassed my expectation than fell short of
it though I had not fancied that so much of the Parthenon had perished.
The beauty of it however is what no engraving can give any proper idea
of, even independent of what all the buildings here owe to the excessive
beauty of the Pentelicon marble they are made of. The temple of Theseus
I have from my childhood been familiar with a print of. I should never
be tired of looking at it. The interior has been made a museum for the
sculptures they occasionally dig up & I was not at all prepared for
their extreme beauty: there is one statue very like, & I think equal to,
the Mercury or Antinous of the Vatican, & a number of sepulchral groups
in which grace & dignity of attitude & the expression of composed grief
in the faces & gestures are carried as far as I think mortal art has
ever reached. It is of the happiest augury for the treasures of
sculpture that may yet be found when the government sets in earnest to
make excavations in the heaps of ruined temples. The modern town which
is nearly all on the further side of the Acropolis, away from the sea
(the street I live in points directly towards the Acropolis) pleases me
very much, it looks so new & fresh, & consequently so clean—though the
praise must be almost confined to the houses—the streets though mostly
straight are made irregular by being badly levelled. The Palace, & the
better class of houses, look like bits of Munich—the churches are of a
very respectable old Tuscan stile of architecture—& the poorer houses
clean & wholesome looking, & indeed even in the country I remarked that
I never before saw any country in which were such clean new hovels. The
gay Greek costume, always point-de-vice, & the strangeness of the Greek
inscriptions in the streets make every step one takes an excitement. The
way to Eleusis is across the properly Athenian plain, bounded by Mount
Hymettus on the east, Pentelicus & Parnes on the north, & Ægaleos on the
west, through which by the short low pass of Daphne we passed to the bay
of Eleusis (formed out of the Gulf by the island of Salamis) which forms
the southern boundary of the Thriasian plain now Edition: current; Page:
[427] green with corn in ear & vines in full leaf. The hill at the foot
of which Eleusis stands (still a rather large village) has an excellent
view of this little plain & the mountains which bound it, Cithaeron &
Parnes or at least branches therefrom. There is a good deal of dust
today & a strong north wind, which however is not cold, at least when
one walks—though returning from Eleusis in an open carriage it became
coldish in the afternoon, about five. This is a nice inn, very clean, &
everything very good—my darling would be quite comfortable in it & I do
so wish she was here, for the good of being here is above all in the
remembrances & I do not at all like having so many remembrances of
beauty which do not belong to her as well—though to me the constant
writing to her about the places from the places themselves, makes them
strongly associated with her—but still it is not like her seeing them
herself.

20th. Today I with the accustomed party saw most of the sights we had
not already seen, which are nearly all outside the city—& walked to
Colonos & the olive groves of the Academy which though hardly any
remains subsist, is still the place where most of the gardens hereabouts
are made, being the greenest part of this arid plain—very tolerably
green at this season, being watered by the Cephissus, a river rather
smaller than the Ravensbourne (as for the Ilissus it is even thus early
a very small brook & later in the year is quite dry above the place
where the fountain Callirhoe breaks into it)—at the foot of a little
ledge of rock where the Ilissus makes a little cascade, very pretty, if
the nymphs had not turned washerwomen. The views were extremely
beautiful—the day less hazy, but cloudy with sunshine mixed, & a violent
north wind which one can hardly stand against & which others call cold,
but I do not feel it so, nor suffer from it in any way: nothing seems
wrong with me but my stomach. The Acropolis with its four temples
(though the Propylaea is not really a temple) combines magnificently
with the hills about—& of the distant mountains, Pentelicus & the island
of Ægina are the finest, except the group at the Isthmus which are
glorious. What light it throws on Greek history to know that Acro
Corinth is seen as a great object from all these heights—much larger &
nearer looking than the Knockholt beeches6 from home. I think that
corner of the Morea must be perfectly divine. The gulf or bay or narrow
channel between Salamis & the mainland in which the battle was fought is
just under our feet but I cannot realize the history of the place while
I am looking at it—all the alentours are so different. I shall do that
better in our drive at dear Blackheath.—The Pnyx where the popular
assemblies were held is cut out of the side of a rocky eminence like a
theatre; & the very bema or pulpit, also cut out in the rock, from which
Demosthenes spoke his orations is as plain & Edition: current; Page:
[428] unmistakeable as Stonehenge, but if the north wind blew as it did
today (it is exactly en face) I wonder that anybody could hear them. No
wonder the Athenians sacrificed to Boreas. That god carried off
Oreithyia from one of these hills, which even in Plato’s time
rationalizing interpreters explained to mean that the lady was blown
over the cliff—as she might easily be. There is a gap in the mountains
between Pentelicus & Parnes down which the god rushes directly at
Athens. By the way the Phyle of Thrasybulus is plainly visible on the
ridge of Parnes. One sees hardly any women here—they keep or are kept at
home more than in Turkey, for they do not go about with veils. The few
one does see are fat & ugly—but the young men are many of them extremely
beautiful & the thorough freedom of motion which their common costume
allows, makes them look their very best.

21st. A most beautiful day, perfectly cloudless, though still what we
should call in England decidedly hazy: the same north east wind but much
less violent. We made the best possible use of it by ascending
Pentelicus. It is about two hours carriage drive to a monastery among
the roots of the mountain & two hours more climbing among thickets. The
approach to the mountain is at this season a green waste, grassy, bushy
& flowery. The mountain, a very elegant broad based pyramid is wholly of
the beautiful marble to which it gives its name—I never scrambled for
four hours over blocks & fragments of fine crystalline marble before. We
passed numerous quarries all the way up, some of them still worked; they
have been wrought into marble cliffs rivalling in height & boldness
those of the Simplon. All the way up the view grew more splendid & when
at the top (more than 3000 feet above the sea) what a panorama! The
Saronic Gulf exactly like a Swiss lake—range behind range in Attica,
Megaris, Boetia & Peloponnesus ending with a high snowy peak which we
mistook for Parnassus—the Acropolis undistinguishable from the
plain—Lycabettus & the adjoining heights reduced to hillocks—Hymettus,
nearly south of us, we saw far over as well as over the mountains of
Ægina—the plain of Athens & the plain towards Sunium spread out green
under our feet with the mountains about the peninsula of Sunium. In the
opposite direction Euboea (one mass of mountains some of them capped
with snow) from its southern cape to near the middle, with the beautiful
blue channel of the Euripus between, & out of this the semicircular bay
of Marathon, with its round treeless mountain-girt plain directly below
us, & the bird’s eye view so perfect that those who were with me thought
they had no need now to go to Marathon: beyond, several of the smaller
islands of the Ægean; the most conspicuous being Ceos, the birthplace of
Simonides;7 but in spite of haze we could make out Andros & even Scyros.
I never saw any Edition: current; Page: [429] combination of scenery so
perfectly beautiful & so magnificent—& the sunset & evening lights on
the innumerable mountains in front of us returning were exquisite. The
haze does not so much affect the beauty of the lights when the sun is
low. The more than earthly beauty of this country quite takes away from
me all care or feeling about the historical associations, which I had so
strongly at Syracuse. That I shall have when I read Greek history again
after becoming acquainted with the localities. I was not at all tired,
except the hand which carried the plants, for the load which Perry & I
brought in was quite painful to mind & body. I never felt so much the
embarras des richesses. Determining them with imperfect books takes
several hours in every 24: it is now past 12 & I have only determined
about a third, the rest must remain in water & in the tin case till
tomorrow—to be determined by daylight—nor have I been able to change a
single paper. I am here in the season of flowers as well as of all other
beauty. It is quite true that nothing, not even Switzerland, is
comparable in beauty to this—but as in all other cases, other inferior
beauty will be more, not less, enjoyable in consequence. If my darling
beauty could but see it! it is the only scenery which seems worthy of
her. Even Sicily recedes quite into the background. And it is but a
fortnight since I thought nothing could be finer than Messina! I hope to
give my darling an account of all the finest parts of Greece by the end
of next month when I shall set out for home.

23d. Yesterday morning the wind changed to west, & it has ever since
been hot, though not oppressive, & cloudless, till some clouds gathered
over the Morea today towards evening: but still not clearer than before.
I was engaged in determining the plants from breakfast to half past one
when I went out by myself & climbed Lycabettus. This is a small
mountain, at most 1000 feet, a mass of rock which rises close to Athens
(behind the palace) & is connected with a range of two or three similar
elevations collectively called Anchesmus which runs a little way
northward in the centre of the plain: it is therefore an excellent
station for looking round on the plain & its boundaries, Hymettus,
Pentelicus, Parnes, Ægaleos with Eleusis & Mount Geranea beyond, & the
gulf with its islands & mountainous coasts: also for looking down upon
Athens, the whole topography of which is taken in at a bird’s eye view,
made at once intelligible. I afterwards walked out on the road which
leads due north & is the promenade of the people of Athens: today being
Sunday there were numbers of people out, & it glittered with the
variegated & bright coloured Greek costume as if the crowd had been
soldiers in uniform. The costume is always the same, saving various
degrees of richness—but full half were in the ordinary European dress,
many of them no doubt not Greeks: a Greek looks particularly mean in
that dress. The women I saw were I think mostly foreigners but I have
not seen a single handsome woman at Edition: current; Page: [430] Athens
& nearly all above the lowest class look sickly. Today we went, the
party of five to Phyle—in a carriage to the foot of Mount Parnes, the
rest I walked, though two horses were sent forward for those who wished
to ride. The scenery & view were fine, but poor after Pentelicus: we
ascended some of the deep rocky defiles of Parnes, very like the
mountains behind Nice, & climbed to the fortress which Thrasybulus
seized,8 of which there are large remains—walls which must have been a
splendid piece of masonry—on an eminence overlooking a very high pass
over Parnes to Thebes from which Thrasybulus came. At the foot of the
mountain is a village which like most in Attica is peopled by
Albanians—the demarchus or mayor addressed me most courteously in French
& Italian, & went a great way with me unasked to point out the way. I
found myself quite familiar with the dress of the Albanian
peasantry—from pictures I suppose, though the Greek dress was new &
strange to me. The Albanian dress is ugly, & the men not comparable to
the Greeks in features though many were fine tall well made young
fellows. You should have seen an old shepherd with a triangular woollen
cap smoking a rude straight tube nearly as high as himself who sat
unmoved & unnoticing while the others were chatting with us & our
guide—very like a Turk—also a little child with her head adorned all
over with gold & silver coins which will form her dowry when she
marries—the way Albanian parents advertise for a proposal. The children
here whether Greek or Albanian do not beg—nor do I believe any Greek
begs who is not in actual want. They are too proud a people for a
beggar’s life.

25th. Yesterday & part of today were again showery, but this afternoon &
evening have been most beautiful, & though the mountains about the
isthmus were still hazy, I have never but once (which was at the same
hour—between five & six) seen the Acropolis in one direction & Parnes in
the other with so beautifully clear & definite an outline. I went to no
new places, but again to many of the old, especially the Acropolis & the
Temple of Theseus: the last, as I expected, incomparably the best
preserved of the remnants of Greek architecture, in fact almost
complete—at a distance seeming quite so: No other temple here is nearly
as well preserved as the one which is the best of those at Girgenti—but
enough of the Parthenon is standing to make it, with its immense size,
very imposing. Not having heard from Wyse who offered to go with me to
Finlay9 & to write to fix a time for doing so, I left my card at Wyse’s
& the next day (today) went to Finlay myself with my letter of
introduction. He told me he had intended calling on me but that Wyse had
said, no don’t, I will bring you together. I found Edition: current;
Page: [431] Finlay a much older man than I expected, thin & white
haired, & as Sydney Smith said of Macaulay,10 not seizing the
distinction between colloquy & soliloquy: however his books shew that he
is really a man of ability, & therefore as he knows Greece so well what
he says about it is worth listening to. He talked to me for about two
hours & would have gone on all day. He thinks the Greeks in a very low
state, & worse instead of better in the last ten years, having returned
to more & more of the bigotry & prejudices of the Byzantines—says that
they are eager & anxious to shew that they do not belong to Europe & the
West: that they like a Frank hardly better than a Turk—that there are no
men of talent growing up, no one approaching to the men of the
Revolution—that their very popular constitution is merely pour rire, or
rather serves only to enable the whole upper & middle class to sell
themselves to the government. He says that the bane of the Greeks is
their self-conceit—that a Greek workman will learn from a German in one
year to make what it took the German three years to learn, & that when
he has learnt it & has made what he thinks a capo d’opera he never makes
anything as good again, but is lost in admiration of his own skill &
ceases to exert himself—insomuch that he, Finlay, has been obliged after
much trial to go back to the German workmen. He told many curious things
shewing the extreme indifference of the government, even the present
comparatively good ministry, to all that goes wrong, which almost
everything does—& the universal jobbing & peculation that goes on, but
said there were two things to ground hope upon—one the universal desire
of education which everybody remarks—there is no country where people
expend so much in proportion to their means, for the instruction of
their children—& their educational institutions are the best they have,
especially the normal school. The other is the administration of
justice, which though far from good is a great deal less corrupt &
dishonest than anybody would expect—that it is not unfrequent for judges
to decide against the government, & that there really is a bar which by
decidedly throwing the weight of its opinion on the side of honesty
keeps the judges in some order. This seems to me very encouraging, & the
cause assigned is still more so than the result. But the ignorance, &
absence of ideas in all classes he says is perfectly wonderful & there
has never yet been a cabinet since the constitution was established of
which every member could read & write.—When I came in I found a note
from Wyse asking me to dine with him tomorrow without ceremony. It is
very strange that I have had no letters whatever here. I infer from the
dates & numbers of yours that you wrote a letter here between the two I
received at Corfu. Edition: current; Page: [432] I teaze the office
incessantly but they profess to put all the poste restante letters in
the window & there is certainly none there for me: This worries me a
little though I am not uneasy as I was at Naples—but I fear I shall
either get none at all, or not till I return from my first excursion in
Northern Greece. I have fixed to start on the 28th, with one companion
certain & two as yet uncertain, but I shall know tomorrow. These are not
the people who came with me from Corfu. Perry & the two young men are
gone today to Smyrna & Constantinople. I gave him a great many Sicilian
plants & we promised to write to each other on botanical matters. He is
a gentleman, tolerably well informed, seems to know a good deal of
physical science, in which he told me he took honours at the University
(Dublin doubtless) makes now & then a sensible remark, the effect
chiefly of his travels, but otherwise has nothing in him. Prebble is
still here but goes to Nauplia & Argos on the 28th & to Constantinople
afterwards. Who or what he is I cannot make out, nor could the others:
he spoke of himself to one of them as a “literary man”: I sometimes
suspect he has been a reporter or something of that sort. He seems to
know a great deal about Greek & Greek matters very inaccurately, but I
perfectly envy his power of speaking languages—very few people speak
their own with as much power & command of expression as he does
French—he can tell the drollest stories in French as only a good talker
in France itself can tell them—& seems to have quite as great a command
of German & Italian. But he never gives me the idea of either a highly
educated person or a gentleman. He spends nearly all his time in hunting
up antiquities & trying to make out sites &c &c. I suspect he means to
write about them. He alone of these people seemed to know something
about me—but whether much or little I cannot tell.—Finlay told me a good
deal about the brigands who are a bad curse to the people of the
country, living at free quarters on the villages, but he confirmed what
all others say of their not meddling with foreigners. The government
first disarmed the people, then disbanded a great part of their
irregular soldiery, & these, together with the convicts let out of
prison to go & revolutionize Thessaly, are the brigands.

27th, morning. Yesterday I went up Pentelicus again partly to shew it to
Prebble (who was accidentally left out of the former party) partly to
get better acquainted with my two probable travelling companions.
Unluckily it was the haziest day of all since I have been here—though
today is the clearest, & the view was much spoilt. It was however a
pleasant excursion & I feel stronger than I have felt yet at all. At
dinner with Wyse I met Finlay, General Church11 & two or three more. The
General is old & fort desséché Edition: current; Page: [433] at least
physically—he spoke much more favourably of the Greeks than Wyse or
Finlay—he thinks many of them care sincerely about liberty & a
constitution & are no further Russian than as they wish well to any one
who is fighting against Turks. He says there are more instructed men at
Athens than in almost any town of Italy. I heard many amusing stories
about brigands but not one of the persons present thought there was any
imprudence in my going or in the least dissuaded me. Wyse will get me
from the minister of the interior a letter to the civil & military
authorities which will order them to give me an escort if I want it—the
cost of which is a dollar a day. But Finlay says he would rather take
the chance of being robbed than the bore of an escort: a sign that the
chance is not great. My two probable companions are both youngish men
which is so far a disadvantage: one is named Dawson12 & is from
Cumberland—pleasant mannered but apparently not a regularly educated
man—with a decided preference for good opinions as far as I can yet see.
The other is a young Frenchman about whose going there is some doubt.
But Dawson for various reasons wishes much to go first to Nauplia, so we
are all three going there with Prebble by the fortnightly steamer
tomorrow to return by the Isthmus, being only away three nights, & the
next day to start northerly. I did not like this plan so well as my own
but thought it best to acquiesce & if the Frenchman does not find
himself too much fatigued by the short journey he will join in the long
one. The brigands on the isthmus are now it is thought dispersed. The
wind though westerly was violent yesterday & has given me some face ache
besides a swelled lip & inflamed nostril but in no other way do I suffer
at all from it & I believe my lungs to be better than at any former
time. Do not write again to Athens darling but write to Corfu—it is too
bad not getting my letters here. When I return it will certainly be by
Ancona, Florence & Milan & then either by the Splügen or the St Gothard,
so a letter to Florence or Milan will be safe. Adieu my dearest dearest
life. As the time draws nearer for meeting I seem to love her more than
ever.

My precious love. I returned yesterday evening from the excursion to
Nauplia, Argos & Corinth & I am obliged to write very briefly because
the horses are ordered & the guide waiting for the northern excursion.
To my Edition: current; Page: [434] infinite annoyance I still find no
letters addressed to me here, but instead of them an answer from the
post office at Naples addressed to J. S. Will, informing me that there
are four letters there for me but that they cannot send them unless I
direct some one there to pay the postage! I know nobody there & have no
mode of sending the money to reimburse them if I did. So I have no
choice but to lose the four letters. Nothing can be more vexatious. The
excursion has been very pleasant & I am stronger & digest better after
it. We went, a party of four, by the steamboat to Nauplia. We crossed
the gulf, passed Ægina—by this time I was sick, but the sickness soon
went off. We passed between the island of Hydra & the extremity of
Argolis: Hydra is less sterile & bare than I expected, & the town, built
round an amphitheatre of rocky hill, still more striking than I
expected. We turned the point & steamed up the Argolic Gulf, passing
between the mainland & the equally illustrious island of Spezzia. The
mountains of the Morea are still finer than those of the Gulf of
Salamis. We arrived at Nauplia in time to ascend to the lofty
mountain-citadel (the strongest fortress in Greece) before dark, & the
view from it round the head of the Gulf & into the interior was
magnificent. In this four days excursion I could not conveniently take
my writing apparatus so that I had to postpone all writing till now, &
now I must cut it short. The next day was employed in the plain of
Argos: this day & the day after were the clearest I have yet had in
Greece. The plain about the head of the Gulf, with the mountains of
Arcadia & Laconia on the further side, high range behind high range &
the furthest covered with snow, was I think the finest sight I have yet
seen in Greece. The Cyclopean walls of Tiryns & the Pelasgic walls of
Mycenae (for there is a distinction between the two kinds) are quite
worthy of their reputation & the first especially has made an indelible
picture in my brain. The Gate of the Lions & the so called Treasury of
Atreus which I believe to be a tomb, are both curious & beautiful.
Nauplia is a small but busy & rather neat town, with a great many quite
Turkish looking houses: Argos is like a large camp, or like the
collection of sheds rather than houses which you may remember near where
the Paddington railway station now is. The accommodation at the inn at
Nauplia was as tolerable as one could expect. The next day we took
horses & went to Corinth through the splendid pass in which occurred the
most remarkable destruction of a Turkish army in the revolution:2 thence
descending to the little narrow plain of Nemea, with the place where the
Nemean games were celebrated very obvious, & considerable & fine remains
of the Temple of Jupiter in the midst, then through another pass to the
ancient Cleonae with a most glorious back view over the mountains of
northern Arcadia (the range of Maenalus I believe) & when we got to the
last height before descending to Corinth, we had all that we missed on
our voyage up the Corinthian Gulf: Parnassus, Helicon Edition: current;
Page: [435] & Cithaeron in their utmost beauty & grandeur with snow on
Parnassus & on the Ætolian mountains—another high snowy summit among the
mountains of Achaia—the isthmus & both the gulfs spread out in all their
beauty under our feet. At Corinth we found there was no longer an inn as
the proprietor of the only one had just died. Our guide took us to a
café where we got an infinitely bad lodging but he had brought beds with
him & found provisions. In the morning we mounted the Acro Corinth & had
as splendid a view if not more so than yesterday’s—& then rode to the
steamer station, Calamaki, & returned to Athens by the steamer. I found
the riding would not do for me but we luckily met a party with horses
belonging to the same owner & effected an exchange of my horse for one
with a Turkish side saddle which is one of the recognized modes of
riding here—& on this I was able to trot & gallop as well as any of the
party, as indeed I had already done sitting sideways on my former horse
with one foot in the stirrup—I was surprised to find it neither
difficult nor dangerous, & am now quite at ease about the journey since
after a day of 13 hours spent between this & walking, I was able to
climb the Acrocorinth next morning early, with neither stiffness nor
fatigue. This is a miserable affair of a letter darling, but you will
like it better than none, & I shall not venture to send another till I
return from my 13 days tour though I shall write it as regularly as I
did in the Sicilian journey. I have made plenty of remarks but they must
wait till I have time to write them. Adieu with the utmost love. dearest
dearest angel. I go with only Dawson. Prebble & the Frenchman go to
Constantinople. In coming down the gulf to Athens, the captain who has
struck up a great friendship with Prebble, took us along the strait
between Salamis & the mainland, over the very place of the battle.3 The
beauty of the long winding strait is exquisite.

I have got thus far, my angel, & am now writing in a nice room of a very
pretty maison de campagne in I should think the finest situation in
Attica, belonging to somebody who was minister of war during part of the
revolutionary period. It stands a little way up Parnes, on the side next
Pentelicus, Edition: current; Page: [436] at a short distance from the
place which the Lacedæmonians fortified in the latter part of the
Peloponnesian war to take military possession of Attica. Where there are
no inns, travellers are of course entertained in private houses. The
owner of this is now absent. We form quite a caravan, having four horses
& two mules, three for ourselves & the guide, three for the luggage &
utensils, beds, provisions &c, also three muleteers & a cook: all this
being provided for the 25 francs a day we each pay, which also includes
the remuneration of the guide. The plain of Attica is a wide extent of
country with cultivation here & there. The thiness of the population
appears from the rarity of villages or houses. Towards the roots of
Parnes as of Pentelicus it is a mere waste, of shrubs, chiefly arbutus &
lentisk: but as soon as one gets into the gorges of the mountain one is
among fine woods, generally rather dwarfish but sometimes high &
strong—with considerable underwood & sometimes green pasture. Here on
the terrace in front of the neat house we look directly on a large knoll
covered with the richest green of cornfields & trees like the greenest
scenery in England & forming a capital foreground to the vale of Attica
as it lies between Hymettus & Ægaleos with the low line of Anchesmus &
Lycabettus between, ending in the Acropolis & the city—& beyond, the
gulf & the mountains of the Morea, these last from the haziness of the
evening (a south wind having set in) not shewing to all the advantage
they might do—but the variety of lights on the nearer sides of Parnes &
on Pentelicus is most exquisite. The commencement of the journey is
auspicious. I am writing this while waiting for dinner, on a table
spread as neatly as at home & I have no doubt we shall dine as well & as
pleasantly as at the hotel at Athens. Our guide, George Macropoulos,2
evidently understands this part of his business, though he does not know
the mountains from a distance & misleads us in the most absurd manner. I
have hitherto found, much to my surprise, the Greeks a remarkably stupid
people—the stupidest I know, without even excepting the English. I make
every allowance for the fact that they & we communicate in languages
which are foreign to both & which they know very imperfectly—but they do
not shew the cleverness that French, Italians & even Germans do in
making out one’s meaning, & they never seem able to find out what one
wants. Invariably they do the very opposite of what one tells them, very
much too conceited to say they do not understand. From Elias
Polychronopoulos the master of the hotel down to the lad who drives a
horse they are all alike both in their dullness & in their conceit: I
mean all those with whom a stranger comes in contact. They seem however
a very well behaved people; wherever we went in the Argos excursion a
crowd assembled round us & stood with a fixed gaze, but never by word,
act or gesture were in the smallest degree offensive, & if we spoke to
them in the few words we could command, or examined their dress or
anything belonging Edition: current; Page: [437] to them, they were
evidently extremely delighted. Like other animals they like to be
noticed. We heard in these woods some blackbirds which sounded quite
like England. In the Argos excursion we heard numbers of nightingales &
saw a large black fox, several tortoises as large as a man’s head, &
quantities of lizards—one today of a beautiful yellow green must have
been from 18 inches to two feet long. But the noisiest animals are the
frogs, who cry four or five times louder than the loudest English frogs
& with a much greater variety of notes, one of their cries exactly
resembling that of the chorus of frogs in Aristophanes.3 My travelling
companion Dawson is pleasant mannered & seems desirous of information
but very little educated & even leaves out many an h—which one would not
have expected from his appearance or the tones of his voice, or his
general manner of expressing himself. One meets with strange English
abroad—one young man came down the gulf in the steamboat with us this
last time & went to the same inn, a white faced weakly looking creature
the twist of whose mouth & lameness of one of his spindle like legs
shewed that he had had a paralytic stroke—he was evidently a gentleman:
he seemed to have gone about very much yachting & was now going to the
Crimea—this young man after dining on the steamer dined again as soon as
he arrived, talked of dining twice as if it were quite a common practice
with him & of drinking a pint of rum & a bottle of wine by himself &
talked in the exact mincing voice & manner which Punch is always
laughing at.

4th. Achmet Aga, in Euboea. After leaving our pleasant lodging we
ascended the very considerable height on which the old fort of the
Lacedæmonians was built, some ruins of which remain: but the view was
not finer than that from the terrace in front of the house. There was
however a view the other way over the plain of Tanagra & the Euripus to
Euboea. We soon got clear of the gorges of Parnes & descended into the
plain or valley of Tanagra where we found already considerably more wood
than in Attica, & some fine specimens of a kind of oak differing from
ours by having its green modified by a slight grey downiness. The
country is mostly uncultivated. This plain is bounded on one side by the
main range of Parnes, on the other by a lower range which turns round
from the east end of Parnes: after some time we ascended this & from its
beautiful bushy height, saw in front the mountains of the north of
Boeotia, to the left the snow clad Parnassus in the distance & to the
right the beautiful channel of the Euripus, now stirred by a strong
south wind blowing up it—beyond were the coast & mountains of Euboea &
the little plain of Eretria. After passing through a gap in some low
hills in front we came in sight of Chalcis, the Negropont of the
Venetians, on the other side of the strait: but the Euripus which in
this part Edition: current; Page: [438] abounds in inlets, makes here a
deep broad bay in the Boeotian coast (the bay of Aulis, the scene of the
sacrifice of Iphigenia) which for want of a ferry we had to go all
round, often turning our backs directly on the place we were going to.
We entered Chalcis by a bridge, like that over a very small river, under
which the sea runs with a force greater than that of the Rhone—&
reverses its direction every eight or ten hours, a curious fact which no
one has satisfactorily explained. The country lies in so odd a way that
we seemed to be crossing from Euboea into the mainland when it was
really the reverse. Chalcis is a much better town than I expected, neat
(for Greece) with some new looking large houses & a generally
whitewashed look: several old Turkish mosques also, two of which we
entered: one is now a Greek church & the gaudy ornamentation rather
spoils the effect of the simple beautiful architecture of the mosque
(which is always one & the same). Another is still used as a mosque by a
few Mussulmans who still live here but though the minaret still stands,
the call to prayer is not allowed. The town is strongly fortified & has
a citadel besides. From the opposite coast it looks fine by its
situation & striking by the vast solitude of the whole wide extended
scene round it. Here also the inn which did exist exists no longer & our
guide procured us a lodging in a private house, that of a marchand as he
expressed it: & curious it was. The ground floor was wholly a courtyard,
having the oven in one corner where the women were baking bread—the
remainder being the receptacle for all manner of untidiness & worse. The
house consisted of one floor resting partly on walls, partly on supports
to which the ascent was by a partly stone partly wooden flight of steps,
leading to an open wooden gallery—(the floors in Greece are always wood
& not stone as in Italy & Sicily) & adjoining this were the
rooms—apparently three besides the kitchen—one of which was made over to
us. It was cleanly & freshly whitewashed but two swallows had made their
nest in one corner of it & in the morning flew about the room. The
swallows here go everywhere: they are a most beautiful breed, white on
the under surface, with black heads & backs, larger & more svelte than
ours & with much more of song. Of course cleanliness is impossible with
such inmates & indeed to make these people cleanly the first requisite
is that they should not live with their animals as they now do. This
morning we first crossed a considerable plain on the banks of the
beautiful Euripus, now perfectly calm & glassy. As the mountains of the
north of Euboea came quite down steep to the strait, we had to go inland
into the midst of them, through gorges covered more & more with pines,
some of which had a peculiarly beautiful head-of-hair sort of look, & we
came to more & more green trees, especially the oriental plane which we
always have met with in Greece about the rivers or rather brooks. We
wound up a high mountain, from parts of which the view back on Chalcis,
the Euripus & the south of Euboea was magnificent while on the other
side we Edition: current; Page: [439] looked over northern Euboea, the
Locrian & Thessalian coast & the island of Scyros. We descended into the
most beautiful deep ravines imaginable, in which the usual evergreens,
much increased in size (especially a kind of arbutus with a red bark,
much larger than ours & which flowers in spring) were mingled with ash,
the common English oak, several other deciduous oaks, a fine sumach, the
judas tree in the full beauty of its delicate green leaf, & above all
the oriental plane. We continually crossed little bits like the wilder
parts of a fine English park, set in a frame of mountains, & at last
came out on a plain (surrounded by mountains) covered with magnificent
plane trees which we were never tired of looking at. One noble tree in
the full vigour of life & health must have been fully equal to & much
like the castagno di cento cavalli.4 Here we again saw cultivation,
which we had left behind in the plain of Chalcis: In the midst of this
plain is a small village with the Turkish name of Achmet Aga, a village
made entirely by an Englishman named Noel5 who for his reward has lately
had his house actually gutted of everything worth removing, & the whole
village plundered by a set of brigands. It is in his house we are
lodged, quite unexpectedly, for the guide told us he had asked
hospitality of a German named Emile.6 This is exactly like the ignorance
& gross inaccuracy of their guides (this man is thought one of the best,
& I have tried two others). The supposed Emile turned out to be Müller,
Noel’s partner. Noel is very like William Adams7 in appearance & ways; &
he welcomed us heartily. He is full of indignation against the
government which never punishes brigands, continually amnesties them, &
even appoints them to offices. He says things are going from bad to
worse & he fears that after having given twenty years of his life to
this place he shall be obliged to leave the country. He was here
travelling at the age of 19 when the Turks were obliged to sell their
land & leave the country: all Euboea belonged to them & finding that he
could buy one of the largest & I should think quite the finest estate in
Greece for £2000 he did so. He is now quite out of spirits. He says
nothing could be more quiet than the country for the first 10 or 12
years & the people were well conducted & attached to the law: but they
are now becoming demoralized by seeing men guilty of the most horrid
Edition: current; Page: [440] crimes going about rich & often placemen.
The brigands entered his house in the middle of the day, remained five
hours, & if Noel had not had a large sum of money in the house which
partly satisfied them he would no doubt have been tortured with boiling
oil to make him disclose the supposed hiding place of his money. The
people outside though armed made no attempt to resist, & a Greek
according to him (except the regular soldiers) never will expose his
body to an enemy: he will only fire from behind a tree or a rock. The
authorities at Chalcis had full information of the intended raid, but
neither took any measures to prevent it, nor gave the people in the
island notice to take care of themselves.

5th. at a village in the north of Euboea where we are lodged very
comfortably in an unfinished house, I should think the largest in the
place. The day’s journey (though the weather was both hazy & cloudy) was
the most splendid I ever had. We continued to descend the plain or
valley in which Noel’s village stands—A clear mountain brook or river
winds down in the midst among a perfect forest of the noblest plane
trees—one, a single trunk (not several from one root like the one we
admired yesterday) was the most gigantic tree I ever saw: Dawson
measured it round with his outstretched arms & it took eight lengths.
There is much cultivation in the valley, most of it by Noel’s tenants.
The system here is metayer; the government tax of 10 per cent & the seed
are first deducted, & the landlord takes in kind a third of the
remainder. After a while we ascended another range, & all the rest of
the day we passed in crossing or looking down upon deep broad ravines
between mountains much clothed with trees, half of them at least (&
sometimes the whole) deciduous: the plane, several kinds of fine oak, &
various others. It is useless attempting to describe it. Whatever one
picks out as the choice bits in any other southern country compose the
whole of Greece, & here we have it mixed with much of what is finest in
the northern countries. We often overlooked the Ægean on the eastern
side of the island, with Scyros apparently quite near—a long mountain
ridge: & at last came in sight of the Gulf of Volo in front with Othrys
& Pelion behind it & the islands of Peparethus, Sciathos & others over
against its entrance (in a clearer day we should also have seen Ossa &
Olympus) making the divinest view I ever beheld. About the middle of the
day we came to a large rich village where the people were assembled for
the fête of their patron St George & we saw dancing of the most barbaric
kind to truly Turkish music, a drum going like strokes of a blacksmith’s
hammer & a sort of flute sounding like a bagpipe. There was general
personal cleanliness & much fine dressing—they are an odd people like
South Sea islanders I should think. Noel shewed us several of the
cottages of his peasants—one large room, with an earthen floor, the fire
in the middle & a hole in the roof above it for the smoke—one end of the
room sometimes Edition: current; Page: [441] partitioned off, sometimes
not, for all their animals, cows, oxen & all. In the midst of one of
these stood the paysanne, a neat, still handsome woman, quite finely
dressed for the fête, making the oddest contrast with all that
surrounded her. At the dancing nothing could exceed the polite
attentions we received from all the people. It is impossible to dislike
such universally good humoured & courteous people but they are almost
savages. They always consider & speak of themselves as Orientals, not
Europeans. George, our guide, who has travelled a good deal & speaks
French very well for a person of his condition, always says in answer to
any criticism “cela viendra avec le temps”—it is to be hoped it will,
but all the English here except General Church think things are going
backward. In Greece it is not generally the custom to sleep in a bed:
all but decidedly well off people spread a carpet or rug on the floor &
lay themselves on that, with some kind of coverlids or without any, & I
suppose without undressing.

7th. Stylidha, on the Gulf of Zeitun.—An hour’s walk took us to
Xerochori, a large village, & the chief place in the North of Euboea,
where we had a conference with the Eparchos or sous-préfet, to whom a
functionary (the captain of the port of Limni) whom we met at the fête,
had volunteered to give us a letter, to assist us in hiring a boat to
cross to the mainland of Greece. We found the eparch, who is a Hydriot,
something like a man of business, & I believe the islanders generally
are decidedly more civilized than the Continental Greeks. He loaded us
with civilities & invitations & sent a man with us to Oreos, the port of
embarkation, two hours off, to speak to the captain of the port there.
Oreos is a little village, which replaces a large town of ancient Greece
& here we waited a great part of the day, there being only one boat in
the roads large enough to take horses & the demand therefore being
exorbitant. The captain of the port was unluckily absent but when he
arrived he obtained some little abatement & we were obliged to close
with the boat. It was a decked boat with two masts, but the horses so
filled it that there was little more than standing room. If the wind had
been good we should have made the run up the Gulf of Zeitun in three
hours; but we were becalmed & it took us twenty one, not only losing a
day, but obliging us to pass the night on board—& as it was perfectly
impossible to go into the tiny hole below we had to make our beds on
deck—a hazardous experiment you will say for me—but it was so serene &
warm a night, without a breath of wind, that taking every possible
precaution I sustained no harm. The day had been one of the haziest I
ever saw in fine weather. The next morning though still hazy was
somewhat better, & the scenery was beautiful, but in spite of landing
our horses to lighten the bark, we made hardly any progress till after
midday when a brisk wind sprung up. We passed between the north end of
Euboea & the narrow strip of Greek territory which lies between this
channel & the Edition: current; Page: [442] Turkish frontier & is known
as Phthiotis: when we had passed Euboea & the entrance of the Euripus we
entered the Gulf of Zeitun or Lamia which runs northwest. The whole way
we had the mass of Parnassus visible on the left, much more clearly &
nearer at hand than ever before, & the snowy tops of Œta & Othrys ahead.
The range of Othrys forms the northern boundary of the Greek kingdom.
Œta is some masses of mountain a little back from the gulf. The
mountains come very close to the water’s edge, leaving in one place only
the narrow pass of Thermopylae which we first saw from the water & shall
see tomorrow thoroughly. Our guide wanted us to land at Molos on the
south side, very near Thermopylae & not go to Lamia at all, & by this we
should have saved a day, but as the dangerous part of the journey, if
any, begins here, & we were told that there were only national guards at
Molo, in whom we felt no confidence, we decided (as the Eparchos had
advised) to land at Stylidha, the port of Lamia on the north side. There
we waited on the civil & military authorities, presented our ministerial
order, & are to have a guard of six regular soldiers or mounted
gendarmes early tomorrow. To this we are legally entitled: what we give
to them is bakshish—a word in much use here—in which form they will cost
us about a dollar a day. We got, by the aid of the mayor’s deputy, the
best & most spacious lodging we have yet had, in a newly furnished
house—two very tolerably large though scantily furnished rooms (but we
carry a table with us) from the balcony of which we look over the gulf
full upon Parnassus, Œta & Thermopylae. The waters of the gulf abound in
curious animals, especially the jelly fish which looks like a ring of
seaweed—seen closer the ring is seen to be composed of muscular fibres
stretched across from the inner to the outer circle, a gelatinous mass
filling up the inner, & fibres like roots hanging down below—the thing
moves by contracting its muscular ring. This day of inaction has
fatigued me much more than the previous days of hard walking & riding—&
I must hasten to bed. The handwriting of this letter testifies to my
fatigue but I am better in health than usual—that is, I digest
better—well as to digestion is no longer a word for me. But I have
abundant strength & stamina.

9th. Topolia: We started from Stylidha with our six guards who however
were not regular soldiers: but they only went with us to Lamia, three
hours off, past the head of the gulf. Here the commandant gave us two
non commissioned officers & eight privates, to whom the commandant of
the following station of his own accord added two more: so we are well
protected. The number makes no difference in what we pay. Some of them
go before us & others behind & at the commencement they threw out
vedettes to right & left but they left off this when they got into the
narrow ways. At the head of the gulf there is a considerable plain, &
the part near Lamia is better Edition: current; Page: [443] cultivated
than any other part of Greece which I have seen. There is however a
great deal of marsh round the head, as with the Lake of Como. After
crossing this plain we entered the pass of Thermopylae, between Œta &
the gulf: first crossing the Spercheius, a river of some size, the first
real river I have seen in Greece. But Leonidas8 would not know the place
again, for in the 2350 years which have since passed, the Spercheius has
brought down so much soil that it has converted the narrow pass into a
broad flat, partly marsh, partly covered with scrub, through which the
river winds its course in a very slanting direction & at last falls into
the gulf. The side of Œta rises very steep, but covered with copse. The
place of the ancient pass is fixed by some hot sulphurous springs which
now as then gush out from the foot of the mountain, & also by the
tumulus which was raised to contain the sluice. The foot of the mountain
is a perfect shrubbery of oleander, agnus castus, & wild vine in
addition to the usual shrubs of the country. After we had sufficiently
examined the place we climbed a part of the mountain & wound round its
sides, catching an occasional fine view of the Gulfs of Zeitun & Volo,
the north end of Euboea &c. but unfortunately the fine weather has
disappeared, the day was showery, at last thunder came on, & lasted with
most brilliant lightning nearly all night. We halted for the night at a
village called Boudonitza, at some height up a pass in the range of Œta:
we were lodged at a priest’s house, which was a queer place enough but I
did not observe any bugs—the quite new house we lodged in at Stylida
swarmed with them. In the morning we continued to ascend the same pass,
the sides of which were covered with the most beautiful Alpine fir wood,
to which the brilliant greenness of the young shoots gave the most
attractive beauty. We were now completely in Swiss scenery. When we
reached the top of the pass we looked down suddenly upon the great
valley of Phocis, larger & broader than the Valais, & reaching from
Boeotia to Thessaly—it lies between the range of Parnassus & that of
Œta, the former of which was now spread out before us & the group of
summits more particularly known by the name of Parnassus was exactly
opposite. Clouds however hung on most of the tops & it soon begun to
rain & rained at intervals all the rest of the day. The valley is very
green at this season—the centre alone is cultivated, though the whole is
evidently very fertile—the rest is waste or beautiful woods of oak &
plane: several beautiful streams run down it towards Boeotia & I suppose
all join lower down. But a village or two of few houses, just visible in
nooks of the mountain, are all that remains to represent the twenty
cities of Phocis. People talk of coming to Greece to see ruins, but the
whole country is one great ruin. After crossing obliquely this great
valley we entered the gorges of the opposite mountains, which are like
Edition: current; Page: [444] very wild parts of the higher Alps, and
nearly as verdant—with great richness of wood, both firwood & deciduous
trees, & great affluence of water. An exceedingly long ascent followed
by a much shorter descent brought us into another long green valley
(much narrower however) which we followed to its head & ascended the
long woody pass which terminates it, the rain gradually went off & gave
us fine views of the mountains behind,—& finally we came out at an
immense height above a long deep & broad valley reaching quite to the
Corinthian Gulf, which we saw in the evening light of a blue like the
blue Salvia, with the mountains of the Morea behind. The descent was
very long to the village of Topolia, though this is still at a great
height above the valley. We have now turned quite round Parnassus & have
got to the west of it which it seems is the best way to Delphi. The road
all day was the remains of an old Greek or Roman paved road, most of it
however washed away & only enough remaining to shew what it once was: We
are lodged at the neat looking house of the owner of the only shop (I
suppose) in the village, but it is, for a village, a very large & fine
shop—I do not think Chalcis, with its completely Turkish bazar can
produce anything comparable to it. All this part of Greece is as unlike
the aridity of Attica as the Alps are to the mountains about Nice.

10th. Delphi. A short day’s journay, only 4 hours; which & a good deal
of walking about afterwards I did on foot. Leaving Topolia where we were
almost eaten up with bugs, we descended into the hollow & made our way
back into the great deep valley of Salona, the one into which we looked
down yesterday evening but from which we had diverged in the twilight.
Salona itself, a large village or small town, is some way up the
opposite side of the valley, on the base of a very high snowy mountain
approaching to the height of Parnassus—This valley is well cultivated,
the cultivation even going a short distance up the mountains on both
sides. After descending the valley for some time towards the sea we
began winding up the eastern or left hand side of it, until we
overlooked the Crissœan plain (hid before by a winding of the valley)
quite down to the Corinthian gulf, or rather down to the bay of Salona
into which I had come in the steamer—we saw the port of Galaxidi & the
neighbouring heights well, but the mountains of the Morea were hid by
the cloudy, & at last showery day. The plain of Crissa, formerly
dedicated to the infernal gods for the impiety of its people (they had
obstructed & pillaged the visitors to Delphi), & forbidden to be
cultivated under the penalties of sacrilege, is now one of the greenest
& richest pieces of cultivation in Greece, half of it being beautiful
olive groves which also press into the narrow gorge up which lay the
Sacred Way leading to Delphi. We looked down into this gap, but could
not see quite to the bottom: it is immediately below very high &
precipitous mountains, while the side on which we were spreads Edition:
current; Page: [445] out at a certain height into a gentle slope, in
which is a good deal of terraced cultivation, the whole resembling some
of the upper parts of the lower valleys in the Pyrenees. At the higher
edge of this slope is Castri, which has now resumed its name of Delphi &
we have put up in a very humble private house. Delphi is one of the very
few places in Greece of which the views in Wordsworth’s Greece9 give a
more favourable idea than the truth: it is however fine, backed by a
very precipitous cleft portion of Parnassus & looking down into the
broad valley with a narrow gorge at the bottom of it, rapidly ascending
from right to left. I dare say it was very imposing when it was a fine
town with a magnificent temple: it seems to have been at that time
entirely built on artificial ground supported by a solid wall along the
mountain side, much of which (most splendid masonry) still remains. The
Castalian spring is a humbug. The only bit of ground approaching to a
level to be found near the town was also propped up by a wall & formed
the stadium or racecourse for the Pythian games, the most important &
celebrated in Greece next to the Olympic. The site of the temple of
Apollo is now clearly ascertained & the foundations have been partly
excavated: it is in the very middle of the modern village. Many
fragments of reliefs & other sculpture & large pieces of broken column
are lying about. But I think the most curious thing we saw was a very
primitive mill for pressing the oil from the olives, which we saw at a
small monastery close by, very nearly as wretched a place as the private
houses.

12th. Lebadea (or Livadia). We set off from Delphi to climb as much of
Parnassus as it is expedient to ascend at this season, namely to the
Corycian cave where the Delphians of old used to take refuge from
enemies & which served for similar purposes lately in the war of
independence. After a steep climb up the part of the mountain which is
immediately above Delphi, we arrived at a table land of some miles in
circumference, very much resembling an ancient crater—round which rose
many summits, the great mass of Parnassus proper with its snowy top
being at the further extremity. The table land itself is very uneven &
has a park like look from the firs & other trees scattered over it,
intermixed with pasture & even cultivation. There is a considerable
village on it further on, near the foot of the principal mountain; but
we stopped short of this & climbed one of the minor ones to within a
short distance of the top (about the most difficult ascent, & subsequent
descent, I ever made, being entirely pathless, though not dangerous)
when going in at a low entrance we found ourselves in a colossal
subterranean hall, with a dark passage beyond it, great stalactites
hanging down, & the stalagmites below looking in the dim light like
gigantic figures of men & animals. The view from this mountain over the
Corinthian Gulf was much Edition: current; Page: [446] hindered by
clouds on the higher summits of the Morea but the day was very fine &
the clouds gradually cleared off. We descended by a different route to a
large village named Arachova which is higher up the Pyrenean-looking
gorge overlooked by Delphi & overlooks it in the same manner, saving
that it looks (owing to a turn in the hills) down & not across the
gorge, direct towards the Crissœan plain. This valley is on the whole
well cultivated; the sloping side of it is very generally laid out in
vines & there are many olives in the lower part; but the mountains on
the other side like the sides of Parnassus above are too precipitous to
admit of any cultivation. Soon after passing Arachova we reached the
summit of the pass & saw quite down to the Lake Copais & the plain of
Boeotia; & of this we had better & better views as we advanced in our
route; which was a rapid descent of two or three hours, till we met
another valley ascending from the Corinthian gulf, in the part of it
called the bay of Aspraspitia, & the abrupt sides of this valley forced
us to turn to the left & ascend it—this fork being exactly the place
fixed on by the Greek tragic poets as the spot where Œdipus met his
father Laius without knowing him, & killed him in a fray.10 At the top
of this second valley we wound over a mountain pass & came out at the
head of the broad valley of Boeotia which comes quite up to the foot of
Parnassus. At the root of the mountain is the ancient Daulis, now the
village of Davlia (the scene of the tragic adventure of Philomela)11 &
here we put up for the night. Though it was a long & hard day’s work I
was not the worse for the fatigue, but had all day the worst indigestion
I have yet had—for some days I have had it worse & worse but now I must
decidedly pull up & I put myself at once on regimen. In consequence I
have had today a much less bad attack. Today has been a short day but a
very fine one—the whole way along the plain. Parnassus & the other
mountains round were most splendid in the cloudless sky & bright
sunshine & Parnassus looked, even more than from any other place, his
full height. The plain or valley of Chaeronea is surrounded by
mountains, those on the east side being rather low—these separate it
from the valley of Phocis & we saw across the low mountains (mistake: it
is a lower part of the same valley)12 the high ones which bound that:
including the range of Œta which we passed over two days ago, & the
snowy range of Othrys with one domelike summit, running east & west &
closing the whole prospect on the north side. The plain of Chaeronea is
a basin with only one outlet, & the aspect of the place, combined with
the perfect flatness up to the Edition: current; Page: [447] foot of the
mountains & the depth of the alluvial soil, shew that it was once a
lake. In the middle of one side of it is the site of Chaeronea itself,
of which the only remains are a theatre much of which is preserved: the
battle was fought in the plain a little lower down, & on the spot are
lying about the fragments of a colossal lion erected in honour of the
Greeks who fell fighting against Philip13—this lion had quite sunk into
the ground by its own weight & when it was found about 25 years ago was
quite perfect, but the ignorant Greeks blew it to pieces with powder in
hopes that it contained treasure. The only fragment recognizable is the
colossal head which shews how imposing it must have been. At this place
Plutarch14 lived, in the time of Trajan, & consoled himself for the fall
of Greece by writing his lives, & much amiable philosophy. Instead of
going round by the outlet of the basin we crossed a low part of the side
of it, & entered into the larger basin containing the Lake Copais where
we immediately saw before us, mounting up the side of one of the
bounding mountains, the town of Lebadea. It looked from a distance like
any of the villages we have passed, only larger. When we were in it, we
found streets with Turkish bazar-looking shops, like Patras or Chalcis
but on a still humbler scale. It is however the largest town in northern
continental Greece. We put up, for the first time, at a Khan, that being
the custom here: there were Khans in most of the places we have been at,
but the private houses were supposed to be better. Here it seems you
cannot get accommodated in private houses: the Khan however is much more
roomy than the little holes we have been squeezed into & there is quite
as much furniture, viz. two stools & a table. It is also quite
clean—much cleaner than the last two, where the plague of fleas has been
prodigious (as it is here), but, contrary to what might be thought, the
only places where we have been tormented by bugs, or seen any, except a
stray one or two, have been the only two really clean & new-built
houses—rooms with clean washed boards & brilliant whitewash. This
accords with the theory that bugs are a wood insect. We here parted with
our escort, but are to have a fresh one tomorrow. No dozen people could
be more well behaved or even well bred than these men, & the sergeant
who commanded them is really a gentleman. We could converse little with
them, being obliged to speak through the guide as an interpreter, but we
could understand their courtesies. They are very gay & lively, &
listening to their talk among themselves I continually caught words
which notwithstanding the difference of pronunciation I recognized as
ancient Greek—The cave of Trophonius was near this place & they shew
something which they pretend to be it, but the better opinion is that it
is Edition: current; Page: [448] blocked up by rubbish & has not been
found. I have thought it better to rest & write this than go to see the
sham piece of antiquity. Through the whole journey our fare has been as
good as at a good inn & the mode of serving it as neat & well ordered as
in an English household. Dawson is a very pleasant fellow traveller,
sensible & right feeling in all practical matters—he knows no Greek, I
think not even the alphabet & very little Greek history or rather none
at all: his ignorance of it is such that I wonder at his coming to
Greece—what he does know is some chemistry, & a little geology. He is of
Cumberland, from the valley of the Duddon, & as he seems to have no
profession & talked of somebody as a tenant of his, I infer that he has
a small independence in that country of divided landed property. He is
not a disagreeable or troublesome acquaintance to keep up, living at the
opposite end of England.—After writing this in the open loggia of the
Khan (which Khan I can compare to nothing so well as to the loft & rooms
over an English stable) I went out & climbed to the ruins of the
Venetian fortress above the town which stands on a height facing the
perpendicular cliff of the mountain, from which it is separated by a
deep & very picturesque gorge—& has a splendid view. Livadia is a
wretched looking place.

13th. Plataea. We were off about six & rode or walked for twelve hours
but as it was all on a comparative level I am less fatigued than in any
former day. Our road lay at first along the roots of Helicon, raised a
little above the great basin of the Lake Copais. The lake itself, owing
to the stoppage of the Catabathra, or channels natural & artificial
which formerly let out its superfluous water into the Euripus, has
invaded much of the surrounding country & it is even said has submerged
some of the numerous cities of Boeotia—it is now a mere swamp, ugly &
pestilential & I was glad to hear from the commandant of Lebadea that
there is a scheme for draining it which however has been put off for
want of money. If there were security here & confidence in the
government, a company could soon be formed in England to do it,
indemnifying itself by the sale of the reclaimed land, the alluvial soil
here being the richest in Greece. Across the low mountains which bound
Boeotia along the north eastern coast we saw the beautiful mountains of
Euboea nearly from one end of the long island to the other. We had the
choice of two roads, one through Thespiae, the other over part of
Helicon, much longer & more difficult but commanding fine views: not to
make the last two days of our journey too long, we gave up the Helicon
road, except making a detour to the fountain of Aganippe, formerly
sacred to the Muses, which lies in one of the folds of Helicon, having
an appearance very like an English mountain. The fountain like Castalia
is a humbug & I cannot believe it to be the true one. Helicon however is
a very fine verdant mountain consisting Edition: current; Page: [449] of
a long unequal ridge like some great animal with a camel’s hump on the
small of its back. Beyond this lies Thespiae on a small height, with a
church into the wall of which are built some good ancient bas reliefs.
It is a small village, now known by the significant name of Eremocastro
or deserted encampment, & looks across the highly cultivated & broad
plain of Thebes to the long range of Cithaeron which closes Boeotia to
the south & being prolonged into Parnes, separates Boeotia from Megaris
& Attica. Across this plain we passed, crossing the field of battle of
Leuctra, a fine place for the manoeuvering of troops, in the midst of
which is a large high tumulus for the bodies of the killed. Between
Leuctra & the foot of Cithaeron runs westward a fine green vale to the
mountains of the Isthmus. We passed very near the walls of the old town
of Plataea, the enceinte of which is pretty complete, & arrived at the
modern village, which is a little higher up than ancient Plataea &
nestles under the foot of Cithaeron. The view from it is superb: all day
when we looked back we had magnificent views of Œta & Othrys &
especially Parnassus. We now look back over the broad green uneven plain
of Thebes, along the beautiful line of Helicon to the left, terminating
in the sea of summits which border on that side of Parnassus. We lost no
view by not going over Helicon, as the day was hazy & the morning even
foggy, though the weather is now extremely fine—indeed hot, but I have
not found the heat oppressive anywhere in Greece, except a little at
Athens. We are worse lodged tonight than ever before, being in a sort of
Irish cabin (except as to size) quite as bad as that which Noel shewed
us in Euboea: however for once it does not matter as the insects do not
seem to be worse than elsewhere & our own beds & useables are always
clean & comfortable. Notwithstanding the strictest regimen & the great
quantity of exercise I have suffered much from indigestion today.

15th. Athens. My dearest dearest angel I have received this morning her
letter to Athens—the first part would have made me perfectly
miserable—the second leaves me only anxious—but it is well that the time
for going home is nearly come, as I should henceforth have felt certain
that no news was bad news, & should have been terrified whenever I did
not get a letter at the time & place I expected. Thank heaven that she
is so much better or rather less ill than she was & is again a little
hopeful. I am so glad you have had Ferguson.15 We have the summer before
us & must do whatever is best for enabling her to recover some health &
strength. My plan is to return by way of the Morea & cross over from
thence to Zante, there to join the steamer which leaves Athens on the
29th of May. By giving up the Morea I could go a week sooner, but as I
am here & able to do it & am never likely to be Edition: current; Page:
[450] here again, it seems a pity not to see some of the very finest
things in Greece. The steamer will take me to Ancona where I shall find
a diligence to Foligno & I hope from thence to Florence & I propose
returning through Switzerland but as I do not think it would do for me
to travel day & night the long distances, I may be obliged to go by
voiture & even so to stop for a day now & then. From Bale to Strasburg
or Paris is quick work by railway—still it will hardly be possible for
me to be at Paris by the middle of June—but as I said in one of my
letters, my holiday on the most strict interpretation does not expire
till the 15th of July, so that if we met at Paris even at the end of
June we should have a fortnight to spend there together. I will waste no
time on the road & if my darling writes immediately to Florence I shall
be almost sure to get her letter which will tell me whether she will be
able to go to Paris & how soon. If she cannot tell in time to write to
Florence, then to Milan. It is provoking that so many of my letters, all
of which I paid, & generally a very high postage, should have been
charged again. Of course the Sicilian post office officials embezzled
the money, but those at Corfu I cannot understand. I shall pay no more
till I get to Florence. To resume the account of my journey: at Plataea
a disagreeable thing happened—the guide’s money bag, containing nearly
100 francs, was stolen. He charged the mistress of the hut & her
daughter & carried them off to Thebes where Dawson & I had to go with
him to the authorities to tell what little we could, but the chief of
the police who held his court in a kind of dog kennel, very judiciously
did not take our evidence as he had no one to interpret it but the guide
himself. Dawson & I had previously each separately made up our minds
that we would refuse to sign evidence so taken. As no fastenings of
doors practicable here are effectual, I wonder nothing had been lost
before. It is lucky for him & for our journey that it only happened the
last day. Nearly the whole foundations & more of the walls & turrets of
the old Plataea still exist, it lies on the slope up to the fort of
Cithæron, overlooking the plain rather than valley of the Asopus &
making the detailed account in Herodotus of the battle of Plataea16 very
interesting & intelligible. We see from it the whole of Boeotia, bounded
by Helicon, Parnassus, Othrys, Œta & the Euboean mountains, but not
Thebes, which is hid by a rise in the intermediate undulating plain.
This plain at least is a good specimen of cultivation. The present town
of Thebes, a wretched place, & made more so through an earthquake two
years ago, lies on the north east side of one of the undulations,
turning its back to Plataea & looking over one of the finest of the
smaller basins which form the basin of Boeotia. Our course from Thespiae
to Plataea, from Plataea to Thebes & from Thebes to Attica was a
complete zigzag. We crossed the Edition: current; Page: [451] plain or
valley from Thebes to the port of Cithaeron, up & across which there is
a really well made winding carriage road: but (cosas de Grecia) between
Cithaeron & Thebes it is little but a track, & on the side next Athens
it has been so left unrepaired & is so worn by rain & watercourses that
it is hardly practicable for carriages. The view from the top of the
ridge of Cithaeron is one of the finest in Greece—Olympus is said to be
visible but the day was so hazy that we could not see it. All the
distant views in Greece have been more or less spoilt for us by the
haze—but happily the near ones are so splendid, one does not feel what
one loses. At Eleutheroe, the site of a ruined fortress of the time of
the crusades (an error. Gen. Church tells me it is Hellenic), at the
foot of Cithaeron on the side next Athens, we met a carriage which I had
ordered to be sent to enable me to gain an additional day’s rest at
Athens. We went through the lower gorges of Cithaeron, among the dry
wastes of Attica to Eleusis & thence to Athens. We left our escort at
Eleutheroe—having heard nothing of brigands except that some had been
taken near Chaeronea & Orchomenos. I shall now take three clear days of
rest before starting again for which I shall be much the better,
although I am not at all done up by the journey. I have been more
fatigued some days than others, but not increasingly fatigued: when I
have been able to take a long walk before riding at all, I have hardly
been tired at all—& so when the country has admitted of much trotting or
galloping. It is the sitting on horseback with my feet dangling that
fatigues me when long continued: but I now recover myself by walking
which I could not so well do in Sicily. My digestion is not quite so bad
& I hope by degrees to bring it round. Probably now a perfectly regular
life such as we have at home will agree better with it than travelling.
But to all appearance the pulmonary complaint has derived the greatest
benefit from this holiday. I called on Wyse this morning & saw him: he
agreed in all I said about the Greeks, & told me many things, shewing
the same brainless stupidity, & incapacity of adapting means to ends, in
the acts of their government which I had observed in the common people.
I now perfectly understand all I see in Greece, but I must say I now
feel little or no interest in the people. Still if they get education
they may improve. Wyse thinks the stupidity is in a great measure
laziness but he admits them to be stupid. I began this letter the very
day my darling wrote hers & it is only now going—the post being
tomorrow—but I shall write also by next post before I leave Athens.
Dawson writes every evening to somebody at a length which makes me quite
ashamed of the shortness of mine. But whatever I have not written it
will be delightful to say when the happy time of meeting comes. Adieu my
beloved—with the utmost possible love & longing to see her again—adieu
my dearest dearest wife.

My dearest wife,

having written so lately I have not much new to tell, but I do not like
to set out on another excursion during which I shall have no good
opportunity of despatching letters, without writing a few words to say
how I am up to the last moment & what I am going to do. It is now
settled that I go alone, Dawson having made up his mind not to go. This
is disagreeable, as it increases the expense from 25 francs a day to 36,
besides my having to pay the whole instead of half of the back fare, &
the boat to Zante. It will not cost me much less than £2 a day for the
12 days it will take—but it is the only expensive part of my journey,
which has not hitherto cost at an average above £1 a day or thereabouts.
I feel quite capable of the journey, but in case I find it too fatiguing
I can shorten it to eight instead of twelve days by omitting Sparta &
Messenia—but as these by all accounts are the most beautiful parts of
the whole country I shall not give them up unless obliged. There are few
or no robbers in the Morea—Locock,2 an attaché here, & his brother, have
just returned from a tour there in which they took no escort, & nobody
seems to think more than one gendarme desirable. I shall not take any
unless where on enquiry from the authorities I find the roads are
suspect. The authorities evidently always wish you to take an escort as
the soldiers gain something & the government loses nothing. So there is
no danger of their disguising risks. During the whole northern tour it
was never either hot or cold, but delightful summer weather: At Athens
however it must have been hotter—the barley (the only grain about here)
is all ripe, & being cut, & the country is assuming its summer brown.
Today however is the first really hot day. I am not afraid of heat in
the Peloponnesus as I shall be in the midst of high mountains, & the
plain of Arcadia is 3000 feet above the sea. As to health I am doing
very well. The three days rest have quite refreshed me & my digestion
has much recovered. It is curious that after dining out I always have
either no indigestion at all or very little, although latterly I have on
these occasions eaten much more than usual—which I can only explain from
my drinking several glasses of wine. Yesterday was an example. I dined
with Wyse, & saw many people, his salons having been opened in the
evening—Church, Finlay &c as before, & among others Mavrocordato,3
Edition: current; Page: [453] & the minister of war Kalergi [sic],4 the
man who headed the people in extorting the constitution from Otho5 & who
previously had, though almost a boy, greatly distinguished himself in
the war: he has the manner & appearance at least of a person of some
character & strength, Mavrocordato that of a superannuated twaddler. I
had some talk with the latter but of course it turned only on general
subjects. Wyse is everything that is most polite & attentive, even to
undertaking that his man shall see after my luggage which I intend
sending by the steamer to meet me at Corfu. The steamers halt a day
there on their way to Ancona & Trieste. I have been reading the English
papers but there is nothing pleasant in them—the war seems likely to
last many years, Palmerston as I expected has disappointed everybody,6 &
all that relates to the visit of the crafty French despot7 exhibits the
whole people of all ranks in England in the most contemptible &
disgusting light. And who is there that thinks this or says it in
England? We, & perhaps Grote—encore he probably thinks it & does not say
it. I hope to find a letter at Corfu—after that I shall have none till
Florence, but I shall be there I expect by the 7th or 8th of June. I
have no thought of staying there longer than a day, for rest. Thank
heaven I shall soon see her now, & thank heaven also that we have the
summer before us—which I hope will set her up & Torquay, now that we
know it agrees with her, is a resource in case of not liking to go
further off. I look forward with the most pleasant anticipation to the
quiet of two or three summer months at our dear Blackheath. I shall
enjoy also resuming old occupations & beginning again to write something
that may be useful after us. And now adieu my dearest wife from your

My dearest love,

I am so far on my Peloponnesian tour, & am feeling in better health than
I have felt for many weeks. I have had not only no indigestion but a
return of the feeling of health which I used to have formerly. And it is
curious that this has not been produced by abstinence, for in the three
days I passed at Athens I ate & drank more than I had done for a long
time. The first morning, not having dined the evening before but had tea
& macaroni, I felt the unmistakeable sensation of wanting stimulus, so I
had two small cutlets at breakfast, & this agreed with me so well that
every morning since I have had the same, & two eggs besides diminishing
the already moderate quantity of bread. I have eaten more at dinner &
generally drank a little wine, & the day I dined with Wyse I did not
restrain myself at all—well, I seem to have recovered my digestion. I
have no doubt the wine helped, but I think the hot weather had a share
too—I always used to have my best health when I took long walks in a hot
summer day, & I felt today the very sensations. The day began really
hot, but with some breeze; then it became cloudy & excessively pleasant.
I walked to the Bay of Eleusis, rode to Eleusis & past, walked again
then rode here. The road overlooks the straits of Salamis & is more
beautiful than I can describe. Everything is made up of beauty here—the
tamest bit of Greece would be thought unrivalled beauty everywhere else.
The Athenian & Megarian plains have lost the little green they had
(except olives & sometimes vines, which are now in full flower &
deliciously fragrant). The corn is all ripe, much of it cut & some
carried. Megara itself is a rather imposing looking village or small
town, on the face of a hill, looking across a belt of country to the
Gulf of Salamis. It lies on a neck of comparatively flat land between
the two Gulfs: forming a broader isthmus outside the isthmus lying
between the beautiful Geraneia (which is the mountain of the isthmus) to
the southwest, & Cithaeron to the north east. I arrived ferociously
hungry & only agreeably tired, at one of the best Khans I have seen,
consisting of two empty rooms closed all round & a third open to the
street on one side—an outside staircase leading to them. So many
enormous loaves are ranged on a shelf along one side of the room in
which I am writing, that it is evident the people who take care of the
Khan are dealers in bread.—In about a month now it will be the real hot
season in Athens, a time of which the English here speak with dread. The
Wyses Edition: current; Page: [455] say that after many trials they find
the best way is to sit up very late, & rise late: for from sunrise to
noon is far the hottest time, a breeze springing up at midday & the
evening being comparatively cool. The weather is still hazy. To judge by
my new experience I should call Greece the haziest country I ever was
in: & Wyse says it is only clear in winter; in spring & summer there is
much hazy weather. From some peculiarity however the near objects are
often seen with the most sharp cut outline when the distant mountains
are quite dimmed by haze. I rather enjoy the change to travelling alone,
or rather without a companion. Dawson I think wished when it was too
late that he had decided to go with me, for he is quite doubtful about
going to Constantinople after all, on account of cholera, quarantine,
dislike of a long voyage, the expectation of bad & dear quarters, &c. He
has shewn himself decidedly selfish, for by his compelling me to go with
him to Nauplia first, or wait for him at Athens, or go the northern tour
without him, he made me lose two days as he knew, five as it has turned
out: he perfectly knows that this loss of time has embarrassed me much
in planning my Peloponnesian journey, & obliged me to give up things I
should like to see, besides causing me the extra expense of crossing to
Zante instead of meeting the steamer at Patras: & he knows how much more
expensive the tour is to me from not having a companion: these things
being so, if he cared no more about going to Constantinople than it now
appears he does, the balance should have been turned by the reparation
due to me.

19th. Corinth. We started at seven & arrived about five, of which I did
not ride above three hours, & walked the rest. I am not more than
pleasantly tired, though not so well as yesterday, owing to my having
returned to the old stile of breakfast. I propose henceforth to eat no
bread, but breakfast on macaroni & tea, & dine on soup & chicken or
meat. I think this diet has a good chance of agreeing with me. The
weather is delightful, just hot enough and just wind enough: the road, a
continuation of that most delightful route overlooking the gulf, with
its deep blue waters, Salamis, Ægina &c & a last view of the tops of
Pentelicus & Hymettus. By degrees the Acro Corinth raised its globose
mass in front of us, & getting clear of the roots of Geraneia, we came
on the comparatively level ground of the Isthmus, with its splendid
views of both sides of the Corinthian Gulf: Parnassus, Helicon &c on the
north, & the mountains of the Peloponnesus on the south, including the
massive lofty & snowy summit of Olonos (as the guide says), Khelmos as I
suspect, which rivals Parnassus in apparent height. I am much better
lodged than last time, in an almost empty private house, which however
can boast of two chairs & the same number of tables. The view from the
wooden gallery in the evening is glorious. Tomorrow we make direct for
the centre of Peloponnesus. Before starting in the morning I went about
Megara looking Edition: current; Page: [456] at some fine headless
statues which were standing about in various private houses. A Museum is
much wanted to receive such things, & Wyse says he has at last succeeded
in inducing the Greek Government to establish one.

20th. Valley of the Lake Stymphalus. This day last year I did not think
I should be alive now, much less that I should pass my next birthday in
Arcadia, & walk & ride nearly 14 hours of it. From Corinth we went some
distance parallel to the sea, along the Corinthian & Sicyonian plain,
with a fine though hazy view of all the northern mountains: those of
Ætolia, Parnassus, Helicon, Cithæron & Geraneia. I have at last with
great difficulty convinced my guide that Helicon is not Cithæron. On a
low height at the further end of this plain is the modern village of
Sicyon, with scattered remains of the old town, especially a theatre
with two subterraneous passages cut through the hill, I suppose as
outlets for the people. Sicyon looks across the plain at Corinth. Behind
this height we came to a sudden descent into a very deep ravine,
hollowed out by a small river in the very crumbly soil of this part of
the Peloponnesus. The bottom & sides of this glen were beautifully
green, though more with bushes than with grass. It was full of
nightingales & blackbirds. I have heard no thrushes. After ascending the
valley some distance we had a long climb up the heights which inclose it
& which are, as it were, the legs of the table land of Arcadia: from the
top we again saw Salamis, Ægina &c, & the mountains of Boeotia; the
Corinthian plain in front looking quite brown & burnt up: while a few
steps further on, all was the freshest green & the corn not even in ear.
We found ourselves at the head of a green valley with a small lake at
its further extremity in the midst of very high, some of them snow clad
mountains, with fir woods scattered on their sides: one of them a
massive, very precipitous mountain which we afterwards wound round the
base of, quite the most beautiful mountain I have seen in Greece. We
continued to pass over small heights from basin into basin, for the
valleys of Arcadia have mostly no outlets, or only subterranean ones:
their waters either evaporate or run underground & reappear elsewhere.
These valleys, with few or no trees but often rich pasture, are inclosed
by mountains which rise to a vast height even above this elevated base.
I see that Arcadia is green through the summer or great part of it owing
to its great elevation & the multitude of brooks that gush out of the
mountains everywhere, & to this it must owe its pastoral celebrity, the
cattle being driven up here from the arid burnt-up coasts. I am very
glad not to have missed this as it is not only of a totally different
character from all else in Greece, but the mountains finer. They run
into so many intersecting ranges that I have not yet got to understand
them, but we do seem to have now come up to a high barrier range running
east & west. We are in a village at the end of the valley of the Lake
Stymphalus, the lake completely fills up Edition: current; Page: [457]
the space between the mountains in the lowest part of the valley, which
rises both ways from it—they believe that the little river which I saw
coming out through the rocks at Lerna near Argos (the place of the
Lernaean hydra) is the outlet of the waters of this lake. There is a
much larger & finer lake a little way off, the lake of Phonia, & we were
going there, but were told by some people we met that the road had been
blocked up by a landslip. We therefore turned off to this village in a
nook of the highest mountains; I do not know its name.—My change of diet
has answered; I had no indigestion today, save a very slight one, six
hours after breakfast, which I attribute to having then drunk some
water; which I find, at times, stirs up some wrong chemical action in
the stomach.

22nd Vurlia, overlooking the valley of the Eurotas. I reckoned without
my host yesterday: the macaroni breakfast did not answer yesterday, & a
trial of chicken this morning has scarcely answered better. Still I am
strong, & less & less fatigued, though thinner I think than I have ever
been. Yesterday was a ten hours journey, today eleven: of which I walked
most of the way, except the conclusion of yesterday. I find my only plan
is to start walking, walk till I am really tired, ride for not more than
an hour & then walk again: when I descend from the horse I am always
intensely tired, but it soon goes off by walking.—We left the head of
the valley of the Lake Stymphalus by a climb of about 2½ hours up a most
splendid Alpine pass among fir woods (spruce) which here come down quite
to the level of the valley. I call it a pass, but it is a hollow of the
mountain, leading to one of the lower points of the ridge. From the top
we looked down another fine deep green valley nearly to Argos, &
presently came to the top of a ridge from which we looked directly down
on a broad valley much more elevated than those we had come from, which
the guide at first said was the valley of Tripolizza: across it we saw
some of the highest mountains, peaked & snow clad, which I have seen in
Greece, with their sides covered with firs: these I afterwards found to
be the range of Maenalus, running north & south through the centre of
Arcadia. These however we saw over the tops of other mountains, among
which the valley seemed to wind. It must be the valley in which the
Arcadian Orchomenus stood. In the further part of it there was water,
which will be there till the summer dries it up. We went some distance
down this valley or basin & then crossed by a low pass into another, at
the foot of Maenalus: & went along that: both are highly cultivated, the
whole bottom & the hollows of the mountains being covered with corn,
most of it fully in ear but bright green. These Arcadian basins seem to
be quite the best cultivated parts of Greece & we saw an unusual number
of people in the fields. We left the second basin by a pass over a low
slope of Maenalus itself & came out at the north end of the large broad
valley of Tripolizza. Edition: current; Page: [458] The whole of the
upper part was now a lake, the waters of winter & spring having gathered
together, there to remain till dried up, after which maize will be sown
there. In today’s journey we saw another such lake. Doubtless these
valleys without outlets are common enough elsewhere, but in the north
they become permanent lakes, being filled up to the level at which they
can find a passage. We had to go a long way round this lake, which
considerably lengthened our day’s journey. We came to the site of
Mantinea of which nothing remains but the foundations of the walls, the
circuit of which is complete. It must have been a large town, & I could
not help thinking how different this valley must have looked when it
contained two of the finest cities in Greece, this & Tegea. The roads
through all these valleys are good for Greece, being grass instead of
stones, & we rode at full speed from Mantinea to Tripolizza rounding by
the way a prominent point of the mountains on the west side of the
valley which point bore a conspicuous part in the battle of Mantinea in
which Epaminondas received his death wound.2 It also separates the
valley into two dissimilar parts. The north part has round its head &
along one side the lofty range of Maenalus & is completely a mountain
valley though a very broad one; but south of the point it spreads out to
nearly double the breadth & becomes a plain encircled by rather low
mountains, low at least on this side, where their base is already so
elevated. Over these low mountains appeared a snowy summit, not streaked
with snow like Maenalus but covered with it like Ætna & shining in the
evening sun: this I at once concluded was Taygetus, but (to shew you
what the guides are) my guide said Taygetus could not be seen from here:
I kept my own opinion but said little, knowing it by experience to be
useless: but this morning from a height a little further on he shewed me
the same mountain & said it was Taygetus. This man is reckoned one of
the good guides, & is not by any means stupid for a Greek. After turning
the point Tripolitza came in sight: near the western boundary of the
plain, backed by low mountains, little more than hills, through which
the passage must be easy into Western Arcadia. Tripolitza before the war
of independence was a town of some 20 000 inhabitants, but was
completely destroyed by Ibrahim Pasha3—it is now a small though longish
town, looking from a distance like a pretty village—it is much
intermixed with gardens & trees but quite Greek otherwise, which is not
praise. The Khan however was a good & clean one. Up to this place we
have taken no escort, even between Megara & the Isthmus where so lately
the great robberies were—the post was robbed six days successively—but
Edition: current; Page: [459] there are no banditti there now. Here, at
Tripolitza, the commandant, who can make himself perfectly understood in
English, said there were no robbers in his district, all having been
killed or captured, but he had heard of three in Laconia & he insisted
on sending two footsoldiers with us, though they are a great delay, for
they cannot walk so well as the muleteers (with their fire arms) & want
to rest & boire un coup continually. The plain of Tripolitza is finely
cultivated like the other Arcadian basins but it is not so verdant, the
mountains being more arid looking. All vegetation here is a full month
behind even Pentelicus. We crossed the remainder of the plain, leaving
the village which stands on the site of Tegea a little to the left; then
crossed the low mountain barrier & descended into one of the gorges of
Laconia. All the rest of the day we went from one of these to another,
varying it with an occasional piece of uneven table land—generally
descending, & at last very rapidly. This however though it would be
admired anywhere else is altogether the least striking part of Greece,
the forms of the mountains being more rounded than usual, & the whole a
complete wild with a barren arid appearance—only fine when a glimpse is
caught of Taygetus: but I was well rewarded at the last by the very
finest view of Greece, at least made so by the lights of sunset, but it
must always be one of the finest. This was in the descent to this
village of Vurlia, (near the site of Sellasia) which is itself very high
up in the mountains on the east side of the magnificent green valley of
Sparta. The opposite boundary is all formed by the range of Taygetus on
which this house directly looks—& which is as fine as any part of the
Alps & much finer than Parnassus or any other mountain I have seen in
Greece. The highest part is something like the Dent du Midi at the head
of the lake of Geneva & at present brilliant with snow like that, but
from that highest part it extends in a jagged ridge or series of peaks
to right & left, falls to the length of the Mont Blanc group of
mountains. Below it glitters the Eurotas—the valley immediately under
the village is hid, but above & below it glitters like an emerald, as do
also the sides of the mountains & the view northward to the mountains of
Western Arcadia by the sunset lights was glorious—the mountains
themselves very fine, especially one like an enormous dome with smaller
domes to right & left for shouders. I shall see this valley
tomorrow—unhappily time does not admit of my passing a night at Sparta &
seeing the country in the way I should wish.

23rd. Khan of Georgitzi in Laconia. I walked to Sparta after breakfast,
a three hours walk. The valley, like all other scenery, loses much by
the glare of sunshine, but it does not disappoint the expectations it
raised, except that the mountains on the opposite side of Taygetus are
comparatively tame. The scale of the scenery is so great, that what
seemed from above one great though uneven valley is partly made up of
the buttresses of Taygetus—a Edition: current; Page: [460] range of
green mountains projecting forward from the great range—behind & above
these is the region of firs, & above that is the region of snow. There
are besides lower hills along the middle of the valley so that the
really level ground is narrow—until we reach Sparta where these
intermediate hills appear to cease, & we see the mountains on both sides
gradually decline into the long low ridges which form the two great
southern promontories of Malea & Matapan. Sparta is a new, &
comparatively neat village, built on the old site, laid out in broad
streets which are not at all levelled, but left to nature: cosas de
Grecia! The guide thought it right for me to call on the juge de paix,
of whom I had heard both from Bowen & Locock, who likes all foreigners
to come to his house & always lodges & entertains them, refusing all
payment. I went & found a house externally very like the barns I am
usually lodged in, but internally with an approach to civilization: it
is true the floor of the principal room was boarded very much like a hay
loft, but there were chairs, or something like them, & two sofas which
bore marks of having been slept on. Few Greeks sleep in a bed; a carpet
or rug on the floor is their only couch, & even in the well to do houses
in the villages & country towns not more than a couple of wooden stools
to sit on, with boards round part of the room in the Turkish fashion,
spread with some sort of cloths or carpets. The judge was at his court,
but came at once on being sent for—cosas de Grecia! I was entertained by
his young ugly wife, his old strong looking careworn looking mother, &
his seven or eight years old daughter by name Calliôpe, to hear which
name cried about the house was very odd: I could exchange very little
discourse with them, but they handed me, first a long wooden tobacco
pipe as tall as myself—I contrived to inform them that I did not
smoke—then a tray with a glass of very nice sweetmeat, a glass of water,
& a stand with about twenty spoons that I might take as many spoonfuls
successively as I liked—twenty apparently silver spoons being I suppose
thought a better arrangement than one plate. After this came the usual
little china cup of café neri which is the common Greek civility & is
what a Greek gives to anybody at a café: as an American gives “a sherry
cobbler”—so a Greek gives a coffee, which being never strained & being
served boiling hot is always thick & the lower half undrinkable: this
however being at a private house was better. The judge, Mr Phangara,4
presently appeared—he spoke French pretty well, better indeed than he
understood it when spoken. He is a pleasant mannered man & seems to
delight in the excitement of having foreigners in his house. I had not
time to stay long. After this I rode to Mistra, the town which had taken
the place of Sparta but is now being gradually abandoned for it: it is
at the foot & partly up the side, of one of the green buttresses of
Taygetus, on the summit of which buttress is its citadel, commanding
what must be a splendid view. I Edition: current; Page: [461] had not
time to climb it. The rest of the day I was walking & riding northward
up the valley of the Eurotas, with frequent fine views of the snowy
range which however was often hid as we wound our way among the hills
which are in the valley: at every instant crossing a crystal rill or
brook: it is truly a valley of sweet waters—& the Eurotas itself a
beautifully clear mountain stream, about the size of the larger
Devonshire rivers. I am writing this in a Khan which would be honoured
by a comparison with the worst English hayloft, & the fleas are running
all over me & biting me continually. But I have been well today & am not
at all more tired than is good for me.

25th. Constantinos in Messenia. I am writing in the usual great hayloft,
devoured by fleas—those in Sicily were nothing to them, these are so
much more numerous & bite so hard. The people, alas, keep their rugs &c
here, which ensures what I am suffering. Since I began the last sentence
I caught one in the act of getting into my nostril. They make their way
up from the floor much faster than I could catch them if I did nothing
else. I have two days to relate. The ways from Laconia into Messenia are
two: one up a gorge of Taygetus, & through a very conspicuous gap in the
ridge, to Calamata: the English at Athens all recommended this route,
which is the shortest, but the most difficult. The guide however said
horses could not go—mules must be taken at Sparta & the horses sent
round—which would cause expense & delay, & though I suspect the
difficulty is of the guide’s own making, I gave up the idea. (The fleas
are now attacking in columns, & firing into many parts of my body at
once.) The other way is by rounding the extreme north end of Taygetus, &
this we began on the 23rd & completed on the 24th: first among low
hills, with frequent views of the range: at last the broad valley of
Megalopolis began to open on the right—& from its spaciousness & its
situation it well justifies the choice of Epaminondas when he induced
the Arcadians to found a great city there as a curb to the Spartans.
This valley is much of it covered not with olive but with oak wood: it
goes round the end of Taygetus. We did not go quite round, but went
through a low pass which cuts off the last hill, & contains the village
of Leondari with a fine view both ways towards the valley, or plain. We
then entered an oak forest exactly like an English wood, & after some
two hours of this, partly across a corner of the plain, partly ascending
some heights beyond it, came out at the upper end of a fine green
descending gorge, part of the way down which we found our stopping place
for the night, a village with the Turkish name Dervenia, from which we
looked directly down on the plain of Messenia & right upon the mountain
of Ithome opposite, the principal scene of the war between the Spartans
& Messenians, & the site of the city to which Epaminondas brought the
expelled Messenians back, i.e. their descendants, after two centuries of
wandering. This place Edition: current; Page: [462] was the object of
today’s employment, the pleasantest day’s work I have had, both from
what I saw & because I felt unusually well. I seem to grow stronger & to
be less tired every day. This morning we crossed the plain, or rather
this side of it—it seemed a mere valley like that of Megalopolis, & a
low ridge hid even its termination by the sea at Calamata—but in truth
it goes round Ithome (which is an insulated high mountain projecting
into it) & fills nearly all the south west corner of the peninsula. We
went straight for the mountain crossing the river Pamisus, a real river
& rapid, but not with the exquisite clearness of the Eurotas—then
climbed a considerable height up & round the beautiful green mountain,
through a fine wood, with oaks, fir trees, the usual arbutus, judas tree
&c for underwood till we reached the top of a low pass on the shoulder
of Ithome, connecting it with the heights which bound the basin on the
side towards Arcadia. Here the walls of Epaminondas met our sight, & are
one of the very finest things in Greece—the splendid Hellenic masonry,
the finest in the world—the walls & many of the turrets still stand, to
a very considerable height, with the edges as sharp almost as when first
cut—looking as fresh as Waterloo bridge, the enormous blocks remaining
fixed in their places by their own great weight without cement. This was
the northern entrance of the city but the enceinte was immense—it went
quite round the bulky mountain of Ithome—along the ridge of a smaller
mountain which extends beyond Ithome & juts out into the plain—then
crosses the valley to the top of the heights on the opposite side & goes
along these till it returns to the gateway by which we entered & which
is a circular corps de garde in excellent preservation. The town
extended southward down a valley into the plain, with the Gulf of Coron
(or Calamata) & the heights which bound it on the west, apparently quite
close (though the day as usual was hazy). We passed into the great
inclosure & made a complete tour of the mountain passing the little
village of Mavromata which occupies a small corner, & returning over
another pass between Ithome & the lower mountain beyond it to the south.
From this the view both ways was one of the finest in Greece—south west
the mountains of Coron & Modon (which stand quite isolated) the
intervening plain of Messenia & the gap or outlet towards Navarino: on
the other side the reverse of the former view of Taygetus, with the
valley I had crossed in the morning extending quite to the sea, the town
of Calamata at the foot of Taygetus close to its own beautiful gulf, &
two beautiful promontories beyond, the further of which was the long
jagged descending ridge of Taygetus terminating in Cape Matapan, the
southermost point of Greece (islands excepted) which, & the sea beyond
it, became finely visible a little lower down the mountain. In a
beautiful part of this descent is the monastery of Mount Ithome, where
we halted to rest the horses: the monks seemed decent, good sort of
people, but very ignorant. I managed to have some little conversation
with them in Edition: current; Page: [463] Greek, the only language they
knew. After descending to the foot of the mountain we proceeded
northward along the valley to the beautifully situated village in which
I am now suffering. A hundred times since I began writing I have
stripped my trousers up & my socks down when numbers of the enemy jump
from their encampment—I am afraid they will consider my clothes as their
permanent quarters & travel with me, in spite of all I can do, through
the remainder of the Morea. I must now go to bed to get partially rid of
them though I fear they have occupied that too. Good night, therefore my
darling love.

26th. Andritzena. I never saw so many fleas in the whole of my precious
life, as I found on my clothes & body on undressing last night. After
chasing them one by one I laid the palm of my hand over six or seven at
once. During the night they danced a saraband on my face, & I fancied I
could hear the sounds of myriads of them jumping on the floor: but
perhaps it was only the droppings of the swallows, for there are always
swallows in these places; the people think them lucky: & they often fly
about in the night, as these did. In the morning while I was sponging
myself nearly a dozen of the enemy gathered on my legs & feet. What is
worse, I have brought a colony of them with me to this comparatively
clean place, & they are tormenting me worse than ever. One little rascal
had the impudence to bite my hand to my very face. But to turn to a more
agreeable subject; this was again a most delightful day. We went up this
fork of the Messenian valley to its very end, & I admired its verdure,
produced in great part by grass: we often trampled on a kind of camomile
which raised a very pleasant lemon like smell, which I had noticed also
in Corfu. Having got to the upper end of the valley we climbed the
mountains at its head—about two hours of hard climbing in very hot sun.
Ever since we entered Laconia it has been hot, the valleys being all
open to the south, but there was always a wind which tempered the heat
when our faces were towards it—a delicious south wind: & today when we
were travelling northward the wind happily changed to north & met us
when we reached the top of the ridge. We now had the most splendid back
view: the gulf of Calamata, the mountains of Modon, Coron & Navarino,
now apparent as a very large group of high mountains—the Ionian sea
through a gap to the right of those: then Ithome, which I never
understood till I saw it from here, blended into one with the smaller
mountain attached to it, a mountain mass apparently rising isolated from
the midst of the plain & lording it over the whole country. It seemed
quite natural that the Messenians, when they could no longer defend the
rest of their country, should have retired to this mountain & held out
on it for ten years.5 In the opposite Edition: current; Page: [464]
direction we looked down into the valleys of Western Arcadia which
unlike those in which I had lately travelled, are not broad & flat but
very narrow gorges deep sunk among high mountains—the reason no doubt
why in antiquity there were none but small towns here. The sides of all
these gorges are scattered with fine oaks & occasionally still finer
planes but not so that they can be called well wooded. We descended by a
very steep path, a descent nearly as long as the ascent, into the first
of these, where we crossed the Neda, a beautiful mountain stream, & as
we sloped gently up the opposite height, we could see the valley slant
down & meet the Ionian sea: the guide pointed out the site of Phigaleia
at a great height, further towards the embouchure on the same side, but
from this we were separated by another deep glen: we turned up the side
of this & went on mounting: mounting till we got as high I should think
as the top of Ithome, & there, on a ridge just where the very top of one
deep glen meets the side of another, stood the temple of Apollo
Epicurius, called the temple of Bassae, built for the people of
Phigaleia by Ictinus6 the architect of the Parthenon, & the best
preserved temple in Greece, after that of Theseus: the Phigaleian
friezes in the British Museum, said to be by the pupils of Pheidias,7
were taken from it. Nearly all the columns of all the four sides,
together with their architraves, are still perfect—the inner pillars are
all gone but one; & the curious bases of more, which (though I have not
seen the fact noticed) project inwardly like a sort of feet of a table &
are of a kind of bell shape. The ground is strewed with unbroken blocks
sufficient it would seem to restore the whole building—these stones from
their out of the way situation not having been taken to build other
houses or broken up to make fences as has been done & is doing
everywhere else. Besides the singular beauty of the temple itself, it
has almost the finest view in Greece—looking over the tops of mountains,
to Taygetus one way, down a deep green vale right over Ithome which
looked really glorious—then another way to the Ionian sea, into which
the Neda could be seen flowing & the plain of Cyparissia round the base
of the corner group of mountains—in another direction the mountains of
Tegea & Tripolizza could be seen—in short the whole southern half of the
Morea—& when after staying above an hour here we resumed our journey &
went about 100 yards higher to the top of the ridge, the northern half
burst on us too, bounded by the snow topped range of Olonos in Achaia,
in which are the falls of the Styx. By the bye in the ascent to Bassae
we passed a fine waterfall, the first I had seen in Greece: I wonder
there are not more in so splendidly watered a country as the south of
Peloponnesus. We continued on alternate ups & downs along the sides of
gorges, all of which fell into the Ionian sea at a little distance, & we
had continual glimpses of that sea, which on this Edition: current;
Page: [465] coast seems to wash the very roots of the mountains. At last
we came out at the head of the long green valley over the sides of which
is scattered this large village of Andritzena: it looks right north,
across the valley of the Alpheus & a sea of verdant highlands tumbled
about in every conceivable manner to the long peaked range of the
Achaian mountains running east & west—the only considerable part of the
Morea I shall not have seen. To the north west across the near hills,
was spread out the plain of Elis, the same which I noticed from the
steamer in coming to Greece & wondered to find so large a piece of the
Peloponnesus so level. The sea beyond was not visible, but beyond that
the island of Zante rose far in the distance. I am really glad to have
reserved this part of Greece for the last. In three or four days I have
had the four finest views in Greece—from Vurlia & the mountains of
Sellasis above it, from Ithome, Bassae & Andritzena. I hardly think even
Switzerland can furnish such a tetrad. I am sure Italy cannot—I have
been very well today, & have found out how to manage myself. I now have
cutlets or chicken & potatoes for breakfast, without any bread—replacing
bread & butter by rice either slightly au gras which they here call
pillaf, or boiled into a solid mass with milk. With this I drink tea,
often without sugar or milk: I find the cause of my dislike for tea
without milk was that I continued to take it with sugar: without either
I have got to like even the taste for my stomach now so craves &
requires bitters that this bitter tea when strong & hot is most grateful
to it & helps it very much to digest. Of this breakfast I am able to eat
much more than I could of any before—& with very little of uncomfortable
sensation during digestion, & instead of being barely ready for dinner
when I arrive at night, I am now hungry early, & when we stop about
midday for the horses & men to eat, I eat a hard egg, & with a lemon
which the guide takes with him & the fine mountain water of these
regions, he makes me some lemonade which by means of a bottle of
carbonate of potass I convert into a delicious effervescing draught—the
gas penetrates one’s whole body, & the effect is like a slight
intoxication by champagne & lasts several hours. The dinner lately is
soup, chicken & stewed prunes & agrees with me perfectly. I get always
stronger & shall be an excellent traveller by the time I leave off
travelling, but I have had enough of it, and when once I get to Zante,
shall only wish that I could cut off the return journey & reach Paris by
a wish. A nightingale is singing delightfully outside, & the fleas
inside are biting my whole body so unmercifully that I must try to get
rid of them by going to my own clean bed. Adieu my dearest angel.

27th. Khan of Olympia. Another most delightful day. We gradually
descended among woods & over fine grassy slopes into the valley of the
Alpheus, & a great pleasure it was to see a real river in Greece—This
one carries off nearly the entire waters of Arcadia, two branches
joining near here, Edition: current; Page: [466] one of which comes from
southern Arcadia & the other from northern. We forded them separately
above the junction, for it is dangerous even at this season to attempt
to ford below: as it was, the muleteers were up to their middle in both
branches, & we crossed soon after another considerable stream which was
on its way to join them. The Alpheus below the junction must have at
least as much water as the Garonne at Toulouse & is like that extremely
rapid. Unfortunately like other Greek rivers & most rivers in a
mountainous country, it does not run between banks, but occupies part of
a broad waste of stones & bushes which at other times it covers. This
however is the only drawback from its beauty. When in the valley one can
see no mountains except when looking towards the head, those on both
sides being hid by very bold high hills. People say that Greece is arid:
I have found all the Morea green, but the valley of the Alpheus & the
hills inclosing it are as richly verdant at this season (almost June) as
those of the Thames are at the same time: one continually walks in rich
pasture half up one’s legs, partly grass & partly camomile & white
clover. The hills too up to the very top of all one can see, are
beautifully wooded. The day was a delightful combination of a hot sun &
a cool breeze. The remainder of our way was along the valley on the
north side of the river; but at one point we met with an obstruction
characteristic of Greece. The villagers everywhere without scruple
plough up the tracks called roads—we missed our way a dozen times today
from this cause: on the other hand no one scruples to ride through
standing corn: & we were informed that in consequence three villages had
combined to prevent travellers from passing, by blocking up with wood
the space between the unfordable river & the cliff. There is thus at
present no road along this great outlet. We had in consequence to make a
considerable circuit over the heights, which however as I was not tired
I did not regret, since it gave me some further variation in the
beautiful views. Passing along this lovely valley was one continuous
enjoyment—but alas, every evening the plague of fleas begins as soon as
I arrive & never ceases till I go to bed. I have been taking them off my
legs the whole evening, but they are never fewer. Whether it is the more
advanced season or they are a worse kind I do not know, but the fleas in
Sicily were never half so troublesome & never bit painfully as these do.
I cannot bear it any longer—they are tormenting every part of me & as it
is a hot night & a close room I was afraid of being made feverish so
left the window open & am threatened with mosquitos. Tomorrow will be
the last of it however, for they cannot be so bad at Zante. I feel like
a horse tormented by flies. Adieu my beloved.

28th morning. Alas the bed was no refuge this time. I could not sleep
for one instant, for fleas & mosquitos, the fleas being by far the
worst. The wretches hopped on the bed & on my face from all sides. This
place is infinitely Edition: current; Page: [467] worse than any at
which I have hitherto lodged. Finding sleep hopeless, at between two &
three I determined to get up, & the guide being equally sleepless we
made preparations for starting at dawn—which I hope we shall do & so get
out of this hell. These khans are now private concerns & this one is
inhabited by a crowd of peasants—the room I am in, which I chose as
looking not quite so dirty as the others, is half full of Indian corn
heaped up on the floor. There is another & the guide says a better—not
world but khan—nearer to Olympia but it is shut up.

29th Zante. We did not get off till half past five, breakfast having to
be got ready & eaten first. In about two hours riding & walking (walking
in my case) we got to the site of Olympia: it is in the valley of the
Alpheus—the place is utterly demolished, but some excavations have
uncovered part of the foundations of the famous temple of Jupiter in
which was the statue by Pheidias 60 feet high. The colossal blocks
shewing the thickness of the columns give a great idea of what must have
been the size of the temple. The place where the Olympic games were held
is very obvious, there being an opening in the hills of just the right
size & shape for a stadium. Below Olympia the hills got low & tame—the
valley opens out into a plain & the Alpheus runs into the sea through as
level & dull a delta as any English or French river—very well cultivated
however & covered with the currant vine, through which we took our way
to Pyrgos, a busy little place, very ugly but with many queer little
shops & a few rather large, some even clean, as usual with wooden shades
along both sides of the narrow street & the most deplorable pavement in
the world filling the space between (save a dry grotto or ditch in the
middle, to contain all & sundry). The English vice consul here,8 a
Greek, has a brother at Athens, who is an acquaintance of my guide & at
his request had written to the vice consul to ask him to engage a boat
for us to Zante: this he had done & was full of politeness &
attention—gave me a two hours sleep on his sopha which I needed much
after my sleepless night—made me dine tête à tête with him (his family
being at present away) in short treated me with the real hospitality
which seems quite universal among Greeks. He too it seems likes all
travellers to be brought to his house & takes no remuneration—I
conversed for an hour with him in Italian & thought him a sensible man.
In a beautiful evening I rode to the little port of Pyrgos called
Katacolo. The country is of a rich verdure even close to the sea, with
currant vines, figs & mulberries: In Laconia also there are many
mulberries & much silk is made. The port is only a few houses & an open
roadstead: the government has for some time been levying an extra tax on
the trade to make a real port but has done nothing in it yet, though the
customhouse officers said 100,000 drachmae had already been collected (a
drachma is Edition: current; Page: [468] about 8½d.) There came in while
I was here a Neapolitan fishing bark called The Souls in Purgatory, no
larger than a Brighton one but it seems they fish in all these gulfs as
far as Constantinople: who will say the Neapolitans are lazy lazzaroni?
Our boat was a decked one with two masts & four great oars, & a hole
below where there was just room for me to lie, & I turned in at dark: &
though the fleas in the boat or in my clothes, or both, kept running all
over me & biting me, my sleepiness made me sleep very sound though
conscious of often waking & doing battle with them. When I finally
awaked at half past five this morning we seemed almost arrived but as
there had been an almost complete calm they had had to row all night. We
did not arrive till eight. The inn here though a poor one is a perfect
luxury after my late lodgings—I made myself thoroughly clean &
comfortable, then breakfasted heartily from which I have since suffered
not the smallest inconvenience, but it is so hot here that I have been
very little out except to the banker’s. The air as usual was so hazy
that the coast of Greece was invisible when I landed, but I shall
perhaps see it from the castle hill which I propose climbing in the cool
evening. People here say the summer has set in hot all at once. The
banker here introduced me to the club where I saw the latest
Galignani’s: everything both in England & the Crimea as unsatisfactory
as ever. They were firing guns & ringing bells today for the arrival of
the new resident Col. Wodehouse9—poor man it is no joyful time for him,
for he will only have heard as he passed Corfu in coming out, the death
of his only daughter whom I met at Bowen’s. It will be a blow to Bowen,
too, for I suspect there was an attachment in that quarter (as the dowdy
English phrase it). This town seems very large after those in Greece, it
is very like a third rate Italian town—the north Italian high peaked
towns look quite imposing after the toyshop looking Byzantine churches,
which look like models of churches.

30th. I had my climb in the evening to the castle & saw the sun set from
it about 7 oclock, so much shorter are the summer days in this southern
latitude. The view is very fine. The promontory of Castel Tornese in the
Morea was very distinct, & seemed quite near: the mountains behind
Mesolonghi & those of Arcadia looked dim in the hazy distance. So
goodbye beautiful Greece—more beautiful than I ever expected, but
beautiful as you are I never wish to see you again10—for I do not wish
ever again to go so long a journey without my beloved one, & the country
will not be fit for her to come to while we live. What a pleasure it is
to see again something looking like civilization—The bay, forming a
semicircle, round which the town stands, is terminated at its two horns
by two high hills, the Castle hill & Mount Skopos which Edition:
current; Page: [469] is much higher. Behind these a plain extends from
sea to sea, with neat white houses each in its garden or plantation,
scattered all over it and backed by a long line of high rocky hills
forming the longest length of this queerly shaped island: behind this
there is plain again but invisible from this side. The plain is covered
with olive grounds & the richest looking vines, both of the common & the
currant kind, the island being famous also for its wines: but the
disease having been particularly fatal to both has nearly ruined the
island: they say it has already reappeared this year, & their sole
consolation is the prospect of an unusually fine olive crop. The vines
look however most beautiful & it is delightful to see the fine white
roads meandering in all directions over the plain. Cephalonia is only
separated by a strait which looks narrow but I remarked how much smaller
the Black Mountain of Cephalonia looked after travelling in Greece. I
had a drive out this morning, for it was too hot to walk—I went about
the plain & went over the country house of a rich Zantiote family—It was
very much the style of an Italian house, except that the floors of the
upper story were of boards (not polished) the ground floor only being
paved with marble. This place is certainly very hot, much hotter than I
have found Greece, & the town seems much the hottest part of it. The
heat seems to agree with me at present but I think it would be too much
for me in the long run. The steamer from Athens or rather from Loutraki
will not arrive till rather late in the evening & will get to Corfu
tomorrow evening where it will remain till the next afternoon. I hope to
find letters there. I shall close this & post it at Corfu as soon as I
land (if the post office is open) to be sure of not losing a post. You
will know by the postmark that I have got safely there & I shall write
next from Ancona unless the immediate starting of the diligence should
leave me no time. My dearest one will have written either to Florence or
Milan, perhaps to both: write next darling Poste Restante a Bâle,
Suisse. I am sure to go there but not sure by what route. After that I
shall see her so soon that it will be needless to write more. She will
get my letters now at shorter intervals as I am going towards her. Adieu
my darling wife—bless her a thousand times.

31st Corfu. I have reopened this my darling to say that I found here two
dear notes, that of the 8th & the one of the 11th to Athens which has
been honestly forwarded here. My last from Athens will have told her all
I can say about our meeting—I do not know how soon I can get to Paris
because I cannot venture to travel by diligence, i.e. day & night more
than a part of the way. But if I lose no time I do not think it can take
me more than three weeks from Ancona to Paris—stopping a day at Florence
& a day at Milan. I shall write to Paris poste restante in case you have
left before this arrives—& all my letters hereafter except one from
Ancona shall be to Paris. I got here after a prosperous voyage about 7
this evening, having by the way Edition: current; Page: [470] seen
Argostoli the capital of Cephalonia which I passed before during the
night: it is on a harbour like an island lake from which the sea is not
visible: a smaller town than Zante, but pretty with a range of rocky
hills behind, between it & the sea, & a range of mountains in front,
along the opposite side of the harbour. I hear the Ionians are letting
the good roads which the English made before giving them their liberal
constitution perish for want of repairs. This island & town look more
delightful than ever after seeing Greece—the town like a fine Italian
town—the country still beautifully green. But the haze seems to get
worse daily. The late cold spring in England like the cold winter is
very unfortunate. I am so happy she liked my letters—they seemed to
myself so poor & tame—but I look forward to delightful talks about these
beautiful places. Goodnight my darling angel.

My darling wife—

I sent to you from Corfu poste restante Paris, the long letter
containing the account of my journey in the Morea. From Corfu here I
have had a prosperous though a long voyage—I dreaded it very much, but
the sea was generally smooth & besides I seem to be getting used to it.
I was not the least sick in the whole three days, eat heartily &
digested apparently well. I left Corfu about two in the afternoon having
breakfasted with Bowen who was as friendly as ever but evidently much
saddened by poor Miss Wodehouse’s catastrophe.2 There was no passenger
on the steamer except several Greeks & the wife & two children of
Saunders,3 the consul at Prevesa, a remarkable man, like two or three we
have had in India, who by sheer moral influence has made himself almost
king of this part of Albania, so that pashas beg for & value beyond most
things, letters of recommendation to him. I saw him at the steamer but
had no talk with him: his wife seems to be nothing particular. We went
out by the north channel past the beautiful Acroceraunian mountains.
When I awoke next morning we were at anchor in the harbour of Brindisi,
looking on one of the flattest of all imaginable countries—& such it
continued all the way to Molfetta where we Edition: current; Page: [471]
halted just before dark—but the country seemed highly cultivated, quite
green with olives, & very populous—dotted over with brilliantly white
houses like the bay of Naples, & every now & then a brilliant white town
down by the shore—mostly small towns except Bari which seemed rather
large, & Molfetta moderate—Brindisi itself is rather small but has a
fine landlocked harbour with a narrow entrance. It felt odd to think how
impractically remote Brindisi had always seemed, & now it was one of the
steps on the way home. Molfetta with two handsome Norman towers &
several churches looked imposing from the sea—but indeed these high
housed white Italian towns all look striking after those of Greece, &
even of the islands, Corfu alone excepted. Beyond Molfetta the Monte
Gargano projects far into the sea forming the sort of wen which you may
have noticed in the map of Italy, on the right hand side of the
stocking—but night soon hid it from us. The next morning we were out of
sight of land, & did not see it again till we came in sight of another
little mountain close to Ancona. We anchored off Ancona about ten in the
evening, but the pleasant police regulations did not allow of landing
till about seven this morning. I got through the custom house by payment
of a zwanziger—the first place in the Pope’s territory where in this
journey I have found the officers bribable. But alas, I find there is no
diligence in the direction I am going till Friday, this being Monday
morning—& I have been obliged to engage a voiture to Forli, two days
journey through Romagna, from which they tell me there is a diligence
that will take me the third day over the Apennines to Florence. This is
disagreeable both by loss of time & expense—I am obliged to cut short,
my darling one, because I start this morning by the voiture aforesaid. I
shall write also to Blackheath in case she should not yet have left
home. Adieu my darling love—your own

My darling love,

I received at Corfu your two letters of the 8th & 11th, one of them
forwarded from Athens—& as you said that the first week in June was the
latest that you were sure of receiving my letters at home, I sent the
long letter giving an account of my journey in the Morea to Paris, à
Madame J.S. Mill, poste restante. I have also written there from this
place, but in case you should not have left home when you intended I
write also to our dear home to say all I can about my future movements.
I have found Edition: current; Page: [472] the voyage here which I
dreaded extremely, so easy that I wish I had not arranged for her
letters to come by this route as I should otherwise have gone on to
Trieste & should have reached Paris much sooner. As it is, the time is
quite uncertain. To my great vexation I find this Monday morning that
there is no diligence till Friday, so I am obliged to go by voiture to
Forli, the ugly road, two days journey & on the third they tell me I
shall get to Florence by diligence across the Apennines—I may be obliged
to go all the way to Bâle in the same manner, so that it is impossible
for me to say within a week at what time I shall be at Paris—I do not
think in much less than three weeks from today—I shall go at once to
Galignani’s & ask for the letter which will tell me where I shall find
my beloved one. I fear there will be much difficulty in getting
accommodated at Paris in the height of the exhibition,2 but the
essential is that I shall see her & be with her once more. I am full of
only homeward thoughts. How much there will be for our nice home talks
on Sundays & evenings. As this is only to give necessary information &
she probably will not receive it I shall not add more but shall write
again to Paris from Florence. Adieu my darling darling wife

My dearest love,

I arrived yesterday evening in this stately gloomy town, & if it were
not for one thing I should say that I am better than I have been for
many months. I now digest almost perfectly though I eat heartily, but as
this great improvement has been brought about by eating meat at
breakfast as well as dinner & often drinking wine, this & the
feverishness produced by travelling have had one bad effect, viz. that
the appearance of blood in the expectoration instead of being quite
exceptional has become very frequent & today in particular there is more
of it than I at all like. I suspect it will not be prudent for me leave
this place without consulting Clark’s Dr Wilson2 not that there is
anything to be uneasy about, but because I need some one to tell me how
to keep this off, especially in travelling—& it will not be amiss to
ascertain the state of my lungs which have not been examined since
Strange gave such a favorable account of them at Naples. I shall not
Edition: current; Page: [473] finish this letter without saying
something more positive on the subject. I found her dear letter at the
post office.—Now for the journey. If my dear one looks at the map she
will see that it was quite out of my way coming to Florence at all as at
Forli I was in the direct road to Parma & Milan—but the explanation is
this. I knew that from Ancona I had the choice of two ways north, by
Florence or by Bologna, & that the one by Bologna was the most direct.
But I heard at Wyse’s that the roads about Bologna were not safe, that a
diligence had been robbed, that there were bands of outlaws about the
country & was advised to go by Florence. I then remembered that you had
also mentioned something of the sort & this turned the scale in favour
of Florence. Then I knew of but two roads across the Apennines from
Ancona to Florence: one was by Bologna, of course therefore I chose the
other, by Foligno. I knew nothing of the road by Forli, which is not in
my map, & as the road was only made in 1836, probably the map is older.
But at Ancona I learnt that there was not only a road but a daily
diligence from Forli to Florence, & that by going so far on the Bologna
road & turning off at Forli, I should save a day. This decided me. I
mentioned in my last letter that I found there was no diligence either
towards Rome or Bologna for the next three days, & that was the story
told me not only by the vetturino whom of course I should not have
believed, but by the commissioner of the inn—who also told me the
padrone had gone out—so being anxious to get on I closed with the
vetturino: but when I went to put my letter in the post, there stood the
diligence for Bologna just ready to start. It was too late now—but I
laid a complaint before the landlord against his commissioner &
absolutely refused to go with the vetturino though I had signed a
written engagement—I told him that having been obtained by fraud I did
not hold myself bound by it but that if he thought he could enforce it &
wished to go before the police I was quite willing to go with him & tell
my story. I fully expected to be taken at my word, as I thought & still
think that any tribunal was bound to decide against me, having a written
document, & only my word against the man’s: however he did not choose to
risk it, so he at all events gained nothing by his trickery—indeed lost
something as he had sent on horses to Sinigaglia as a relai, which I
told him would be his punishment & less than he deserved. I had to find
another vetturino & to pay him the same high price—but there was no
help.—Before I got clear of Ancona I had to fee two more sets of
doganieri a zwanziger each, on pretext of its being a free port &
therefore having custom houses on the land side. They tried it on again
at the next town, but yielded to a mild remonstrance on the unusualness
of examining the luggage at every town one came to. Though this road is
comparatively through level country I was glad to see a little of
Romagna. It was new too to see Italy in the full flush of summer—but the
summer, thus far, is an English, not an Italian summer—clouds part of
the day, never Edition: current; Page: [474] oppressively hot, & a fine
north wind keeping the air fresh & cool. It was a treat also to see
again these North Italian towns, with their large Places, tall houses &
shady clean streets, so unlike Greece & even Sicily & southern Italy.
The first day I passed through Sinigaglia & Fano & slept at Pesaro. The
road was always close to the sea—the country the deepest richest green,
from corn & mulberry trees, with an occasional bit of grass just cut, or
being cut, & as green underneath as any in England. I saw no olives nor
other southern productions. The country was nearly flat but there were
sufficient low hills generally to hide the Apennines, though they were
near—& when visible—looked much like the Welsh mountains from Shropshire
or Cheshire. As I approached Pesaro I came to a longish hill which
projects into the sea & walked up it: here the country began to be
prettily varied & full of trees. I mentioned mulberries before, but they
only began here. The maize is in its first fresh green. It was now
nearly dark & I saw little more this evening, but was indemnified by
myriads of fire flies—the air up to two or three feet above the ground
(they do not rise higher) seemed full of little sparks of fire, dancing
like wills of the wisp, & appearing to be alternate instants
extinguished & lighted again. Next morning I was off at half past five &
got first to Rimini. The country all the way was prettily varied & full
of trees (mulberry chiefly). At Rimini I saw the cathedral which
contains various things more curious than beautiful. There is a Roman
triumphal arch, fine & well preserved, & a more remarkable thing, a
bridge built by Augustus of fine square blocks of marble, over which the
road still passes—probably the oldest bridge in existence which is still
in working condition. There is a very good & wide view of the near
Apennines from hence—the nearest mountain being that which forms the
territory of the little republic of San Marino: the top is like a
segment of a circle, with several prominences, on which are churches &
fortifications, & (as is often the case in these limestone mountains) a
high cliff forming the whole upper part of the mountain, & a green slope
from the foot of the cliff, on which slope the town seemed to be. The
other mountains near seemed mostly flat topped, like the breaking down
of table land, but there were some peaks. At Rimini I had a mischance
like the one near Stuttgard. I walked on before the carriage & took the
wrong way but this time it was by following the directions of the
vetturino who did not know his right hand from his left: had he said
nothing I should have gone right, but he said, when you come to a
parting of two roads prendite a destra—which I did, & went about five
miles on the road to Ravenna, & had to walk back to Rimini & hire a
carriage to run after the other. When I remonstrated it appeared he
thought destra meant the left hand: dritta being the common expression &
the one I always used, but he out of finery used the other without
knowing its meaning. After this the fellow was dissatisfied Edition:
current; Page: [475] because I gave him only a reasonable, or rather
more than reasonable, buona mano. The road here slants away from the
sea, passing through two small towns, Arcangelo & Savignano—in this last
almost every house had on it in large letters, Evviva la
Caracciolo3—Evviva Aspasia Dirik4—I found on enquiry that these were two
actresses who had made furore this carnival at Rimini. Then came towns
of note, Cesena, Forlimpopoli & at last Forli, which is a fine town with
a splendid place & good streets. The next morning at five I was off by
diligence to Florence—across the Apennines nearly all the way. They are
not here particularly fine mountains—the rock is sand coloured & brittle
& with its nearly horizontal stratification the cliffs it breaks into
look like roughly put together brickwork made grey by time—but the
valley gradually contracted into a narrow gorge—the mountains were green
to the top with trees & pasture mixed—& the road at last by a six miles
climb (which I walked up) went over not a pass but a low part of the
main ridge of the Apennines: the descent westward from its rapidity, its
length & the form & steepness of the mountain very nearly approached the
descent of the Mont Cenis. The mountain view from the top was fine
though hazy, & though the green mountains were like overgrown hills, I
saw beeches this day, the first time, I think, since leaving England—&
some oak & chestnut woods. We got to Florence about dark, & I came to
the Hotel d’York, near the Place of the Cathedral, where I am very
comfortable. Coming from the post office this morning I went into the
cathedral, which with Giotto’s5 fine campanile & the baptistery, are
finer outside than I remembered them. But inside the darkness & the
extreme bareness of the cathedral—as there are no paintings nor side
chapels & not above half a dozen statues—make it very gloomy, & to my
feelings not fine. It was filling with people—I got into the very midst
of the Fête Dieu which is kept here with great magnificence & a minor
procession but still a very grand one (as such things go) has just
passed the hotel. But the galleries are shut & nothing can be seen,
except the churches.

Darling—I have just seen Dr Wilson: He thinks the tendency to hemorrhage
quite accidental, no proof of any change for the worse in the chest, but
thinks it is owing to the heat, combined with the change of diet & the
travelling. He has prescribed something for it which I shall take & it
will get right I dare say very soon. But here is a terrible coil about
getting away from here. There are only two ways if I go through Milan—&
the way I have been advised to take is to go by diligence to Mantua &
there take the railway. I Edition: current; Page: [476] have just been
to the office & find that the diligence goes tomorrow at six & does not
go the next day but the day after. I had resolved to go at once & not
see the gallery, vexatious as that was,—Parma & Correggio’s6 pictures I
must lose at any rate. But behold, on account of the fête all the
offices are shut & it is absolutely impossible to get my passport so as
to leave tomorrow. I must therefore wait two days more, for though there
is a diligence to Bologna the day after tomorrow, & one from Bologna to
Milan by Parma, I find I should arrive as soon at Milan the other way by
leaving here on the 10th as that way by leaving on the 9th. There is
another choice—to go to Leghorn, thence to Genoa by sea & from Genoa to
Milan: by this I should save about three quarters of a day but it is
better than that to have the rest here & see the gallery. I am much
tempted to go at once by sea to Marseilles & thence by railway to
Paris—I should then be there as soon or sooner than my darling. But the
sea again would be intensely disagreeable, besides that I should lose
her letters to Milan & Bâle which may contain something important with
respect to our meeting. The best I can do is to wait quietly here these
two days & try to get rid of the bleeding which I am much more likely to
do resting than travelling. I shall get to Mantua in the night of the
10th or early in the morning of the 11th & to Milan in the night of the
11th or early on the 12th. Remaining the 12th at Milan I do not think I
need more than three days to get to Lucerne, viz the 13th, 14th & 15th,
& one day from Lucerne to Bâle, the 16th: then by railway to Strasbourg
the 17th & to Paris the 18th. Allowing two days for detention I do not
think, unless I am unable to travel, that I shall be later at Paris than
the 20th at night, which is sooner than I expected when I wrote from
Ancona. But I then thought of going by the Splügen, not having reckoned
how much shorter it is by the St Gothard. She will not have to wait very
long for me at or near Paris & I shall see her in a fortnight at
farthest. I look forward to it with delight—but ah darling I had a
horrible dream lately—I had come back to her & she was sweet & loving
like herself at first, but presently she took a complete dislike to me
saying that I was changed much for the worse—I am terribly afraid
sometimes lest she should think so, not that I see any cause for it, but
because I know how deficient I am in self consciousness & self
observation, & how often when she sees me again after I have been even a
short time absent she is disappointed—but she shall not be, she will not
be so I think this time—bless my own darling, she has been all the while
without intermission present to my thoughts & I have been all the while
mentally talking with her when I have not been doing so on paper.

Though Wilson talks about heat, it is not very hot, though hotter today
Edition: current; Page: [477] than the former days—or perhaps hotter in
this place than in the country. He says it is not so hot as usual at
this season, & that there has been here such a winter & spring for cold
& wet as he never remembers—they had fires in May. At Corfu where it was
really very hot the day I landed there in my way homeward, I was equally
told that it had been an unusually cool & damp season & that only the
last two or three days had been summer—& certainly I found the place
much greener than I expected, nearly as green as when I left it in the
middle of April. Therefore perhaps my reports of the greenness &
coolness of the Morea at the end of May are an incorrect representation
of what usually happens. It seems to have been a strange season
everywhere.—This is the third letter I have written poste restante to
Paris: the first, from Corfu, contained the account of my journey in the
Morea; the other was a short one, from Ancona, & I wrote also from
Ancona to our home. I shall also write a short letter home from here, as
she told me to in the dear letter I found at this post office. I cannot
think of any place at Paris where she could hear of me, besides
Galignani’s, better than the other English bookseller’s, Baudry,7 who
used to be I think Rue de Coq—he is the man who publishes the French
editions of English books. If par malheur I do not find your address at
Galignani’s through any stupidity of the people (but as I shall know it
is there, I shall not let them off easy) I shall leave mine both there &
at Baudry’s. In that case too I shall go to the post office & see if
there is a letter poste restante waiting there for me & perhaps darling
they will let her leave her address at the post office that so the
letters post restante may be sent to her through the postman—in that
case I should find her address there.

Since writing this I have been a little about the town. By Wilson’s
advice I did not go out in the hot part of the day, but towards evening
I began looking at churches. At the Annunziata which she will recollect,
I saw the Madonna del Sacco & the other famous frescoes by Andrea del
Sarto & others, as well as some Perugino’s. The frescoes are fine but it
requires a much greater painter to make frescoes please & satisfy one
than to make oil paintings do so. Santa Croce was interesting to me
because it contains the tombs of most of the eminent Florentines—Michael
Angelo,8 Machiavelli,9 Galileo10 & others—& they have put up monuments
to Dante & Filicaja who are Edition: current; Page: [478] not buried
there—Alfieri also is buried there though not a Tuscan but a
Piedmontese. But a thing which struck me was a number of frescoes by
Giotto—quite lately uncovered from whitewash (what strange people the
Florentines were for blotting out pictures) so lately, that only one of
them had yet got into the Murray printed in 1853.11 It is wonderful that
the whitewash can be so completely got rid of without damage to the
picture: these which are some of the oldest, are about the freshest
frescoes I ever saw—the whitewash has acted as a preservative: I wish
the Cenacolo at Milan had been whitewashed. I never knew before what
Giotto could do: they are like pictures of the time of Raphael, so free
& flowing & telling their story so well. This church of Santa Croce like
half the churches in Florence is a mere ugly mass of pale brickwork
externally—& internally though there is plenty of light (unlike the
Cathedral) the spirit of the place, that of gloom, is felt: I think the
Florentine pointed arch of grey stone has a peculiarly sombre effect.
Sombre the whole place is with its Newgate-like palaces of rough stone
with their dungeon-like grated windows, a stile of architecture which
the Tuscans must admire very much, since they paint their other houses
externally to look like it. From the gloom I must except the view from
the bridges—it seems as if the town had turned its gay side to the
river—had shewn to it the only smiles it could put on. I have been
puzzling myself to think what feature in the Tuscan character this
character of the town represents, either as cause or effect: so decided
an expression in what meets the people every hour of the day must take
effect on them somehow: one would expect to find them of the traditional
character of the old Spanish don, stately, grave, & sad. I have been
reading English papers at a reading room: I perceive we have taken
Kersch12—it seems a great advantage, reste à savoir if it will turn out
as decisive a one as the newspapers expect. If it were not for the
French there would be little hope, for the Russians will never be
outgeneralled by English lords baited by the Times. By the bye will not
the queen be at Paris at the very time when we are there? if so13 we may
say goodbye to any prospect of lodgings—Tomorrow I shall see the gallery
& probably call on Mr Pasquale Villari, my correspondent,14 though I
almost forget what our correspondence was about. But I shall put this in
the post first thing tomorrow (the post closed at twelve o’clock today)
so tomorrow’s proceedings must wait for another letter either from here
or from Milan. Addio con mille baci. your own

My darling love,

I arrived here yesterday evening & have written today a long letter to
Paris being the third I have addressed there. I found her sweet letter
at the post office & as she asked me to do, I write this to our home
though I have no doubt she will have left it before this can arrive,
unless, which heaven forbid, she should not be well enough to go. This
being only to give necessary information, I will merely say that I
expect to be in Paris about the 20th—I may be sooner, but cannot
possibly, I think, be sooner than the 18th, for reasons which I have
given fully in my long letter—& that is allowing no margin for stoppages
from fatigue or diligences being full. I long for her dear sight & sweet
society & hope never again to be so long separated. Adieu my precious
wife. Your

My dearest angel—

As I am detained here nolens volens I am at any rate making good use of
my time. Wilson’s remedies have worked like magic & the bleeding has
almost gone—without any other change of diet than not drinking wine, if
that can be called a change, since I did not drink it every day before.
So I have been going about all day & have seen much of this place—If
Rome is as I hold it to be, the metropolis of art, this is certainly
only second to it, at least as to painting & sculpture—I have been even
more struck with the modern than with the ancient sculptures & I am more
& more confirmed in the opinion that the Italian sculptors of the great
age of art are quite equal to the Greek. It is not only Michel
Angelo—but the great sculptors whose works stand in the public places
here, Donatello,2 Giovanni di Bologna,3 either of whom has produced many
statues which if dug up out of the ground would be thought fine
specimens of great masters—the bronze Edition: current; Page: [480]
Perseus by Benvenuto Cellini4 which is in the great Place—the wonderful
bas reliefs round the baldacchino at Orsanmichele, by Orgagna [sic]5 who
was the chief painter of the Campo Santo at Pisa—many things of Baccio
Bandinelli6—all equal to great Greek works, & I have now seen here about
a dozen by Michael Angelo all as it seems to me equal to the greatest
Greek. You remember the Bacchus—but I have now seen the chapel at San
Lorenzo (which was shut up for repairs when we were formerly here) in
which are the monuments of Lorenzo & Giuliano di Medici7—The four
figures, representing Day, Night, Evening & Morning I do not much care
about. I can see them to be fine statues, but the greatest artist cannot
make allegorical subjects impressive. But the statues of Lorenzo &
Giuliano themselves to my feeling equal any ever made by hands, & there
is a marble Virgin & Child in the same chapel by M. Angelo almost as
fine—though there is much nonsense written about it, as that the face of
the Virgin expresses maternal affection: to me she seems to be going to
sleep, but the statue is splendid. I went of course to the Gallery—The
Niobe room I could not get into—it was shut up, & the only reason I
could learn was that the custode was unwell. Of course no other person
could open the door & see that nobody steals the statues. It is curious
how in Italy everything yields to the convenience of the people in
charge. On a fête day every place is shut up that the custodi may share
in the fête. But I saw everything else, long & well, & sat a great while
in the Tribune full of admiration. Not of the Venus de Medici, for
decidedly I do not like her: I never liked the casts of her, & I do not
like the original a bit better. I think her the poorest of all the
Venuses. She is neither the earthly Venus nor the Urania. Of course she
is a beautifully formed woman, but the head is too too ridiculously
small, as if to give the idea of having no room for brains—& they may
well say she does not look immodest, for the expression of the face is
complete old maidism. At least these are very strongly my impressions &
I am sure they are quite spontaneous—But there is a host of most
beautiful statues & pictures there, though the statues not quite equal
to the Vatican. There are enough to make one feel in an atmosphere of
art—even to be among all those Roman emperors whom I have got to know
like personal acquaintances. There are also so many fine statues &
pictures all over Florence that I could soon get into the kind of
feeling I had at Rome of being bathed in art. It is strange that the
Florentines should have had so many great painters & sculptors—I suppose
they are like the English, who though so unpoetical a people have had
more great poets than any other country. I am convinced that the
Florentines are a most unartistic, tasteless Edition: current; Page:
[481] people. Who but such a people would let all the churches be masses
of deformity which are a positive eyesore, and disgrace the city—like
houses half built, of half burnt bricks—things in which no private
person could bear to live—the only material exceptions being the
Cathedral which has no front, & Santa Maria Novella which has nothing
but a front. Then the number of fine paintings which they have
whitewashed out, & are now first shamed by the opinion of Europe into
taking away the whitewash or letting foreigners subscribe to do it—then
their most celebrated pictures wantonly made invisible by curtains or
screens shutting out the light—the celebrated frescoe [sic] by
Ghirlandajo in the choir of S. Maria Novella which I very much wished to
see, I could barely see to be fine, & nothing more. Then their constant
practice of repainting their finest pictures which shews such a total
want of respect for the great painters—to me most of the Raphaels &
Correggios in the Tribune are spoilt in a great measure because they
have so evidently been repainted. There is nothing fine in the
architecture of the town externally except what is owing to two men,
Brunelleschi8 who built the Cathedral & Giotto who built the beautiful
Campanile. That tower of Babel, the townhouse, has nothing really
beautiful in it—it is fine to us, because it recals the middle age, but
it is not like the hotel de ville of Brussels, Louvain or Ghent,
beautiful in itself. I have been trying hard to understand the extreme
sombreness of the interior of all the churches—it is not the Tuscan
pointed arch, for it is just the same at San Lorenzo where the arches
are round, resting on Corinthian columns & the general plan that of a
basilica. Still I think arches, which though pointed meet at so wide an
angle that one sees no reason why they should not be round, & which
often have nothing to give meaning to the angle as being the
intersection of two curves, are always poor—though I know not why they
should be gloomy—I think the gloom is mainly owing to the colour of the
stone which is the very coldest grey I ever saw, & the Florentines with
characteristic taste paint with the same grey colour whatever pillars or
other things require painting. I marked that the large fresco by
Bronzino9 of the martyrdom of San Lorenzo in the church of that saint is
spoilt by being spotted all over with whitewash—they did not care enough
about it to hang a cloth over it while they were whitewashing the
ceiling above it. The town itself is a good deal more lively now when
the shops are open, & I sometimes for a moment forget that I am not in a
French town. I feel much more in Europe than I have done at any other
town of Italy. I think I could feel quite at home here if our home was
here—but according to Wilson it is a place quite unfit for pulmonary
invalids, both in winter & summer. I called on Pasquale Villari but he
was not at home. I left my card Edition: current; Page: [482] & he will
most likely call tomorrow. This is a very pleasant good inn, cheap if I
may judge from the good room on the ground floor which I have for four
pauls—kept by a motherly sort of Frenchwoman: the people at the table
d’hôte are half English, the rest French with a party of Greeks. There
were a good many Greeks in the steamer going to Trieste—I suppose they
are mostly traders. Among things I saw today I forgot to mention the
Laurentian library, with the finest collection of manuscripts I suppose
in existence—among them the famous copy of the Pandects brought from
Amalfi & a most beautifully written & distinct manuscript it is. Some of
the later, fourteenth century manuscripts are still more beautiful, but
at that time, one is not so much surprised. There is a Cicero said to be
of the fourth century, a most beautiful manuscript.

9th What I left undone yesterday I have done today, & have seen Florence
itself pretty completely, though nothing of its environs. I passed a
great part of the morning in the Pitti Gallery, the Grand Duke’s own,
which is a still finer collection of pictures than the public gallery, &
is the pleasantest to see of all I have gone to, from the convenience of
the seats. It is a very large collection, mostly of good pictures, &
many chefs d’œuvre. Those which struck me most were two of Perugino,
which Murray in ten columns of notices does not even mention—one a
Descent from the Cross, which when I had only seen the print of it I
thought one of the greatest pictures ever painted—all the disagreeable
of the subject taken away & nothing but a beautiful dead body & the most
beautiful feelings in the numerous gracefully grouped spectators. The
other is an adoration of the infant Jesus by the Virgin & some
children—a small thing compared to the other but quite admirable by the
naturalness & natural grace of the children—the Virgin also very
beautiful. There are many fine pictures by Fra Bartolomeo & Andrea del
Sarto, masters whom I admire more & more. I went again to the great
gallery, but could not get into the Niobe room—again to S. Maria Novella
& by bribing the custode got to see the Ghirlandajos again by a better
light & the famous Cimabue10 which we saw together—to the church &
convent of San Marco where I saw the finest set of frescoes by Fra
Angelico which exist—he was a friar of that convent, as was Fra
Bartolomeo & also Savonarola. Some of the frescoes were in the cells
which seemed very comfortable for Italians—very like the inferior
bedrooms in a good inn. I went to the Carmine church & saw the frescoes
of Masaccio, another painter who like Angelico & Ghirlandajo cannot be
known except at Florence: & who seems to me quite to deserve his
reputation—the whole of the eminent names Edition: current; Page: [483]
of the generation preceding Raphael seem to me well to deserve their
fame. Masaccio, Ghirlandajo, Perugino, Fra Bartolomeo, Luca
Signorelli—not to add Leonardo. Villari called after dinner & not
finding me, followed me to San Marco & went with me to the Carmine—he
took me also to a church I should not have gone to, the San Spirito,
which is as he said & as I quite assent, the finest internally in
Florence—built on the plan of Brunelleschi & begun by him—a perfect
forest of fine columns but the same grey tint & consequent gloomy
effect. San Marco is the only not gloomy church I have seen: curious
that it should be the Dominican. I walked afterwards in the Cascine with
Villari till the fireflies came out & he came & had tea with me
afterwards. I like him much—we talked on the greatest subjects for hours
with animation & he was either so quick or so well prepared that he
understood à demi mot everything I said, & continually said it before
me, or followed it up by the next thing. I feel sure we should like him
& was glad to hear that he thinks of visiting England next year. He is a
little dark man not distingué looking, & a Neapolitan, which I did not
expect—all the judgments he expressed on men & things, without one
single exception, seemed to me sensible. I did not expect anything half
so good.—To complete the account of my day, I got myself weighed this
morning, & weighed as nearly as possible ten stone—exactly the same as
when I left London. I hoped for something very different when I set out,
but could not reasonably expect it in the state my digestion has been in
the greater part of the time. However I have no reason to complain of my
digestion now, for the present at any rate.—Among things I saw I forgot
to mention the celebrated Pharmacie or Spezieria of S. Maria Novella,
(or rather of the Dominican Convent belonging to it) which is quite a
palace, with splendid tables of Florentine Mosaic, the most beautiful
material in the world, but the most perfect waste of human labour—the
time it requires to make it is so enormous. As it is all pietra dura,
natural stone & not a manufactured composition like Roman mosaic, they
have to make holes in the principal stone, the matrix as one may call
it, exactly to fit the pieces which have to be inlaid in it. But the
beauty of some of these tables when executed after a fine design, as
some are in the public gallery & the Pitti palace, is quite matchless.
It was quite curious to find the same splendour in an apothecary’s shop.
The building did not originally belong to the monks but was erected by
the republic of Florence. The most splendid room however is quite new.
The rich green of the cascine was most pleasant to the eye.

11th June. Verona. Here I am darling in this fine town, the finest I
think in the North of Italy, & so completely at the foot of the Alps as
to seem among them. I as little expected to write from here as she to be
written to but Edition: current; Page: [484] the railway from Mantua is
a branch which meets the main line at Verona, & I got to Mantua so late
(past one in the afternoon) that there was no train direct to Milan
except a night train: so I came no further than here, & shall have time
to see the place before eleven tomorrow when there is a train that will
enable me to get to Milan by night. I am extremely glad that I came this
road—I have seen towns I wished to see, & the real Apennines, for the
main chain is so twisted that the road crossed it three times & we were
among snowy tops a great part of the day. I started by diligence at six
yesterday morning & went by railway as far as Pistoja passing Prato: we
did not however go through Pistoja, but kept outside the walls: I could
see several fine looking church towers, especially a campanile, square &
high like that of Florence, but with ranges of columns all round it like
the leaning tower of Pisa. Nothing can look richer, more fertile &
verdant than the Val d’Arno at this season—equal to the very richest
green in England, the trees however being chiefly mulberries of which
they are beginning to strip off the leaves. The valley is bounded on the
south side by low mountains, on the north by rather high, beyond which a
snowy summit could be seen even from the bridges at Florence. Pistoja is
in (or rather near) a kind of elbow in this line of mountains to which
we drove right up & at once ascended the main ridge without the pretence
of a valley or gorge to take us into the mountain region before
ascending. The road is beautifully made all the way, like the roads in
Italy generally: from its windings there were splendid views over the
Val d’Arno which had a most inviting appearance as one looked back—soon
we could see over the mountains which bound it, to other mountains
beyond. We soon got into the region of chestnut woods which cover the
sides of the upper part of even this first ridge, & when we saw over to
the other side, hardly anything but chestnut woods was visible—but as we
got on & climbed other & higher regions, till there were great masses of
snow drift by the roadside, & snowy summits all round us—fields of snow
at last, not drifts—we came successively among beeches, larches, firs &
beautiful flowering trees, mountain ash, another real ash with white
flowers & laburnum growing out of the rocks in brilliant flower &
delicious smell. A remarkable thing is that we not only often passed
little villages, but were never long without passing some thriving
looking farmhouse—& when I looked into these houses I almost always
found a well & carefully tiled floor, tolerably clean, & a great number
of good rush bottomed chairs, with mostly tables also. I take the Tuscan
peasantry to be on the whole the best off in the world—the little I
could see quite agrees with Sismondi’s account of them.11 All the effect
of a good tenure of land. These Apennines have a decided character of
their own, not like the Alps, still more unlike the mountains of
Greece—I Edition: current; Page: [485] really feel as if I had never
seen anything so green as the whole north of Italy, for the plain of
Lombardy is equally so. I of course climbed these high ascents on foot,
& so escaped the extreme fatigue of a long carriage journey but not the
other bad effects, for the heat & the travelling have quite brought back
the bleeding (which had never entirely gone away). However I anticipate.
Night found us still in the mountains. About four in the morning we got
to Modena in the midst of the plain, & finding we were to stay an hour
there, off I set to see the cathedral. It is extremely fine, in rather a
dark stile, & with a feature I do not remember to have seen
elsewhere—one ascends a great flight of steps to the choir, thus
dividing the church into two different levels. The architecture is what
they call Lombard in contradistinction to Gothic—I can only say it is
much more what we mean by Gothic than any of the Italian Gothic
churches—it most resembles the german cathedrals, like Aix la Chapelle.
Though the light was imperfect I could see very fine sculptures. The
tower is reckoned one of the four fine towers in Italy & is really fine.
Modena seems to me the ideal of a residenz—the broad streets not too
broad, the narrow not too narrow—arcades along almost all the principal
streets but not low ones as at Bologna, making the place gloomy, but
high roofed & stately, making it cheerful, & the houses lofty. We then
crossed the plain to Mantua: there was little to see but rich
cultivation, for the mulberry trees hemmed in the view: even when we
ought to have seen the Alps, the extreme haze made the view imperfect as
it did that of the Valdarno yesterday. We crossed the Po, here a broad
rapid river, by a pont volant, & soon saw Mantua among the broad shallow
lakes which almost surround it, & constitute part of its extraordinary
strength as a fortress. One of the most curious things there is the
Ponte dei Mulini, a kind of dyke which separates two of these lakes, of
different levels, & lets the water of the upper one through to the lower
in twelve places turning twelve mills—Along this dyke the road goes,
forming a curious covered way. Mantua is a much larger town than I
expected, but compared with others a mean looking town—the houses being
mostly low: the central streets however are busy & bustling, & with
their arcades look pretty well: I had time to see the place before going
to the train. The architecture here is all renaissance, Giulio Romano
having been employed to set everything to rights & to build or rebuild
everything: the largest church, S. Andrea, is a sort of St Paul’s, &
very like it though smaller—the cathedral inside is in the same stile,
though outside one wall & one tower are still of the oldest darkest
Lombard, contrasting curiously with the rest. I went over the old palace
of the Gonzagas,12 an enormous Edition: current; Page: [486] place, part
of which is still kept up as a palace for the Austrian princes when they
come here—the rest is given up to military purposes; it is full of
frescoes by Giulio Romano, rather fine in their way but not such as I
care about. There is another palace, the Palazzo del T, or Tè (for it is
written both ways) a little out of the town, which is said to be still
finer in the same stile, & with still more & better paintings by Giulio
Romano: I had not time to see it & do not regret that I had not. I have
not mentioned the people in the diligence with me: my companions in the
coupé were a youngish Frenchman & his wife, who had been making a tour
in Italy: they were chatty & good natured but not interesting people.
There were two Italians, a German & four young Americans, whom one knew
for such at the first sound of their voices. I never saw such complete
John Bulls as some of them, they were the English of farces & I have no
doubt such Americans often sit for a picture of English. They seemed
however good fellows au fond, & one who spoke German & Italian tolerably
seemed a decent sort of person. Their twang was exactly that of
provincial English, yet there was something in the manner that made me
know them instantly for Americans. But they or some of them must be of a
class of Americans who I did not think travelled so far. I came on by
railway to Verona, only an hour & a half’s journey & am much struck with
the place—but I shall know more about it tomorrow. By the wayside there
were rich meadows in the midst of an English hay harvest—& the view of
the Alps with one great snowy summit extremely fine. You see dearest one
of the two extra days I allowed myself for contingencies has already
been needed, & I have no doubt I shall need the other if not more—for
with this tendency to hemorrhage, long days of travelling, & night
travelling by diligence, will not do, & I must take things easy. I shall
get some more of Wilson’s medicine tomorrow morning.

12th Milan. I had breakfasted & was out soon after half past six & as
there was much to see I did what I hardly ever do, took a valet de
place—by means of whom at a cost of half a crown I was taken to every
place in the best order for seeing most in a short time—I saw nearly
every thing there is to see, without any hurry. Verona is a cheerful
imposing looking town, with the Adige, here as large as the Seine at
Rouen, running through it not like a mountain torrent but like a
cataract. I feel sure that no small boat could escape destruction on it.
The Amphitheatre is in a large Place in the middle of the town, like
that of Nimes, which it much resembles but the interior is in complete
repair, the steps perfect all round, & I should think exactly as they
were at the time of the Romans, for then too they must have been often
repaired. There is a day theatre which gives representations now in the
centre of the arena, of which it occupies but a small part. The view
from the top of Edition: current; Page: [487] the walls is fine, but
there is a finer from the upper end of the garden of a Count something,
which contains about 100 or 120 of the oldest & tallest cypresses—some
as old as the garden itself, which was made in the 13th century. The
upper end ascends the rocks which overlook the town, & you have a
complete view of all Verona & the plain as far as Mantua. Not to mention
a Roman theatre, triumphal arches &c. this town contains the greatest
number of fine churches I have seen in any town except Rome. They are
mostly in the Lombard stile though often touched up with a little bit of
Palladian not enough however to spoil the effect. The churches though
dark are anything but gloomy & sombre, though the pointed arches are at
the same large angle as those at Florence—but then, in the first place
the columns are generally much higher in proportion to the breadth of
the nave: & next, instead of the ugly grey, there is a most beautiful
material, the Verona marble, mostly of a variegated red colour & called
bronzino from the metallic sound it gives when struck. These churches
are full of fine pictures, many of them by beautiful painters hardly
known out of Verona, especially Caroto.13 These local celebrities like
that of Morrealese at Palermo & Piola14 at Genoa, are not uncommon in
this country of great painters. There are also multitudes of fine
frescoes by Andrea Mantegna,15 and an Assumption by Titian, very much
superior as it seems to me, to the one at Venice—in fact the finest
Titian I ever saw. There were not so many of Paolo Veronese16 as I
should have expected, but there is one picture the finest I think I ever
saw of that master who is not one of my especial favourites. I then
started on the most beautiful railway journey I ever made—the first part
of it at least—I was lucky enough to get a seat on the north side,
looking to the Alps—also the shady side, it being a frightfully hot
day—& we soon reached Peschiera & the lake of Garda—that lake does not
like the others end in a narrow point, but in a broad triangular or
rather crescent shaped base—& though heavy clouds hung over the Alps,
letting only a few snowy summits come through, & preventing any sight of
the mountains at the head of the lake, those round its base were so
extremely fine that one felt no want. This is one of the pictures I have
brought away & shall long retain in freshness. We passed Brescia of
which I could only judge the situation: it is close under some smaller &
greener mountains which here project south from the Alps. There is a
break of between 20 & 30 miles in the line of railway a little beyond
Brescia which we went over by diligence—we crossed the Oglio & the Adda,
now foaming torrents of great size & reached Milan soon after Edition:
current; Page: [488] seven, where I am at the Albergo Reale, a very nice
inn. The cathedral as I passed it looked quite astonishing, like a vast
palace built of stalactites, or of icicles—but I must think that a
statue at the point of each icicle is a very bad mode of terminating it.
Milan looks very gay & bustling & large—like a capital, & very like a
French town. I saw some Galignani’s at the hotel—What tremendous rains
there seem to have been all over France & especially in the south west.
I read Lord John Russell’s disgusting speech17 on the impossibility of
doing anything for Poland & the extreme desirableness of maintaining
Austria in all her possessions—I felt a strong desire to kick the
rascal—it is a perfect disgrace to England that he should be tolerated
as a liberal (!) minister a day after such a speech. What with our
sentimental affection for one despot & our truckling to the other great
enemy,18 we are likely to have a precious character with all lovers of
freedom on the Continent!—I do not know how I shall get away from this
place, for the people here tell me that no voiturins yet go the St
Gothard road—the diligence does, but I am really afraid of the
feverishness of the long day & night travelling in this weather. I could
engage a voiture to myself but the cost would be so enormous. I shall
not close this letter till I can tell my darling what I am going to do.

13th. I have got her dear letter, bless her heart. After enquiry I find
the best thing I have to do is to get to Lugano tomorrow which is on the
St Gothard road & to which I can go by diligence—then get on by
arrangements with the Swiss postmasters who the landlord here says are
very reasonable & will not make me pay nearly as much as if I engaged a
voiture to myself. In this way it may take four days instead of three to
Lucerne & I may require a day’s rest—Should both these things happen I
shall not get to Paris till the 21st, but as this bleeding does not go
away, I must take great care not to overdo the travelling. In any case I
shall write from Lucerne. I have been into the cathedral—let people say
what they will, it is internally much the finest in Italy, & the only
one which produces an effect like the great cathedrals of the north.
There is inside no superabundance of ornament & the arches are pure
Gothic while their immense height gives them the proper effect of
Gothic—& the octagonal sort of temples with niches which go round the
columns at the spring of the arch have a striking effect. Adieu my
dearest angel—love your

TO HARRIET MILL1

Milan

June 14 [1855]

48

This letter, my darling love, which is probably the last she will
receive before the happy moment of meeting, is the fifth that I have
addressed poste restante à Paris. One was from Corfu, one from Ancona,
one from Florence & one yesterday from Milan. I hope they all arrived as
they contain the only notes I have kept of the journey. Yesterday I
staid a good deal in doors reading on account of the heat (there was
some rain in the afternoon which made it cooler) & the comparative quiet
has been good for me—as the tendency to spit blood has again
considerably diminished. So darling there is nothing in it to be uneasy
about when once we are quiet at home (or even at Paris). I went however
to the Brera gallery which we saw formerly. It is but a poor
collection—good specimens of inferior masters & inferior specimens of
good masters—except Luini,2 of whom being the local painter there are
many very nice things—also one fine Titian, St Jerome in the desert, &
the early picture of Raphael of which one sees engravings everywhere,
the marriage of the Virgin. Towards dusk there was a military (Austrian)
band in the Place of the cathedral—I was surprised to find that the
music they were playing was Balfe’s.3 He however has I believe a
considerable reputation in Italy, & I fancy is quite equal to the
present Italian composers. There has never once since I have been in
Italy been an opera acted which I cared to see, therefore (except once
at Rome) I never went: but here I found them at La Scala acting the
Prophète4 & as I much wished to see that, I went. It is said that La
Scala has fallen off because the Italian families no longer choose to go
where the Austrians go—however the pit of that immense theatre was full
& the boxes more than half full. The opera was got up in the most
splendid stile & it is a very shewy opera, full of pomp & spectacle. I
admired it exceedingly, much more than I expected as Robert le Diable5
always seemed to me much overrated. This I think is not—it is extremely
original, full of melody though not of the tunes that one carries off at
once—the accompaniments overflowing with fine music—& all extremely
characteristic—not exactly expressive of feeling in which many composers
excel him, but he seems at every fine situation, & critical moment, to
have found music just suitable to the march of the incidents. It proves
what I doubted Edition: current; Page: [490] before, that there is still
a great musical composer living & not superannuated. It was also on the
whole very well acted—the principal woman, Giulia Sanchioli,6 I think we
shall hear of in England. By the bye how perfectly French the story
is—the hero has concealed his fiancée with whom he is very much in love,
from a grand seigneur who is searching for her, & he gives her up
because the seigneur threatens if he does not, to kill his mother. All
the interest of the story turns on the mother: the fiancée is quite an
inferior personage to her. The theatre does not look so well as
formerly, the colour being now red instead of blue & silver: I took my
place for today to Lugano only but as there are two diligences a day &
not many travellers now, I feel sure of getting on by diligence without
hurrying or night travelling. The only fear is that I may not be able to
get a place in front.

Lugano. The diligence went by railway to Camerlata which is a suburb of
Como. There was no view of the Alps, as the day though sunny & hot at
Milan was heavy with clouds which hid not only the high mountains but
almost the mountainous country itself. However when we got into the
mountains we could see the nearer ones, which was sufficient for beauty.
I heard a nightingale at Monza (& several between Modena & Mantua): this
seems as if they continued to sing later than in England, where they are
seldom heard after the first week of June. We passed through Como, which
looked more like a pretty country town than usual in Italy. It is shut
in by green hills even on the side on which there are no mountains. In
ascending one of these hills we had a good view of the lower end (a
little bit) of the lake. We then went on among hills wooded to the top &
becoming higher & higher, with walnut & other trees in the greenest of
green vallies below—passing through numbers of little towns & villages
with their tall towers which one always sees in views of these
lakes—among others Chiasso, the first town in Switzerland—till we
reached the extremity of one of the many legs, or arms or branches, or
culs de sac of the lake of Lugano. The remainder of the way was along
the edge of this beautiful lake, or just above it—the lake being first
on the left, then on the right, for at one narrow part we crossed it by
a sort of mole completed by a bridge. We arrived at Lugano by the way
opposite to that we remember—the view from the neighbourhood of the town
was glorious even under the unfavourable circumstances of weather (in
the town it had evidently been raining hard) especially the view up
towards Porlezza & the head of the lake was as grand as ever. Lugano is
now full of great masses of houses like German bath houses & has two
enormous & several smaller inns. One of the small ones, overlooking the
lake, at which the diligence stopped, I for that reason chose—it is
large absolutely though Edition: current; Page: [491] small
comparatively & seems good. I had the mortification of finding that I
had lost my botanical tin box—which has been most useful to me, holding
an apparently impossible quantity of specimens & keeping them fresh in
the hottest weather for 24 hours. It must have fallen or wriggled out of
my great coat pocket in the diligence or railway carriage. I am much
vexed at it. I have lost nothing else of consequence in this
journey—nothing beyond a pocket handkerchief which I lost on Pentelicus
& an old shirt which must have been kept by some blanchisseuse—though I
hardly ever failed to count the things & compare them with the note.

16th. Airolo, at the foot of St Gothard. I have got thus far, & it is
not clear when I shall get farther. I made my choice to come this way
instead of the Splügen that I might the sooner rejoin my beloved one,
though I was told at Milan that the road was not open yet for wheel
carriages & that the highest points of the pass must be crossed in
sledges. This has been the cause of frustrating my intentions. I had
hoped as the diligence did not reach Lugano till half past eleven, to
have a walk first, & got up at five oclock for that purpose, but before
I had finished dressing it rained hard—After waiting two hours I got an
hour’s walk during an interval in which it scarcely rained, but the rain
immediately after came on violently & has lasted without intermission
till now. I saw nothing of the Alps, except every furrow of the mountain
sides streaming with foam & often making superb waterfalls, & the Ticino
rushing like a boiling flood & continually receiving streams which
seemed nearly as large as itself. I wound down a mountainside just over
the head of the Lago Maggiore without being able to see it—& went
through Bellinzona (a town of arcades like Lugano) & a great many
villages till at half past eleven I arrived at this place, Airolo, a
village close under the St Gothard. Today it rained worse than ever, but
I took my place for Fluelen on the lake of Lucerne, & proceeded up the
pass to the place where the sledging begins—& to my consternation found
that the sledges, little things holding two persons each, were entirely
open. Several passengers were as much surprised as I was, saying that on
the Simplon & the Mont Cenis the sledges are covered, & that they should
not have come if they had known—but to me it was out of the question
going on, as I should have been thoroughly soaked & had a day in the
diligence afterwards, which in my present state would have had a good
chance of killing me. I had no choice, disagreeable as it was, but to
get out bag & baggage, & go back to Airolo by the return diligence about
an hour & a half afterwards, here to wait till the rain ceases, which
may be by tomorrow morning, or in these mountains may not be for some
time. The man at the office behaved very well & said I might go any
other day without paying again, but my unlucky attempt to get home quick
may make me longer than if I had gone the more round about way. I am
Edition: current; Page: [492] not so well as I was—I had a bad
indigestion all yesterday, as if it was only the heat which made me
digest & my digestion went off as soon as the heat did—but the heat in
going away has not carried with it the tendency to spit blood, in spite
of my continuing to use Wilson’s medicines as regularly as the
travelling allows, which is very irregularly. Altogether I feel vexed &
uncomfortable. But it will all be right when I get clear of these cold
damp mountains: I have not known a damp climate now for so many months
that it upsets me at first.—The change is very great into a free
country. It was almost a novelty to me in the salle à manger at
Bellinzona to hear people discussing politics in the most animated
tones—& the newspapers two of which are taken in this inn shew that the
legislature of Ticino is most active in making reforms & improvements, &
though it is a Catholic canton, has as bitter a quarrel with the Pope as
the Piedmontese government. One of its recent acts is to give the people
of the parish the electing of their own parish priest. They have also
suppressed quantities of convents & have made a law excluding the clergy
from the legislature. Everything here seems to be radical & democratic
au dernier point. This village is at the head of the long valley of the
Lago Maggiore, where it rises rapidly up the mountainside—& the village
is on the level of the lowest firtrees. Mountains with a good deal of
snow on their tops rise immediately above & no doubt the snow is much
deeper & wider spread on the north side. As it is so uncertain when I
can get on from this place (though I hope the best) I shall send off
this letter at once & you see dear there may be time still for her to
write to Bâle or Strasbourg telling me where she is that I may go there
at once from the railway station. If I go tomorrow morning I may still
arrive on the 20th. & now good bye my darling wife.

Now at all events, my darling love, I shall be with her in three
days—twenty four hours I should think after she receives this. My
caution in not crossing the St Gothard on the 16th was justified by the
fact I heard before night that some English people who had gone on had
been obliged to stop at the Hospice—I suppose so completely soaked that
they could not safely go on in their wet clothes. The next morning was
happily fine—sunny though Edition: current; Page: [493] with flying
clouds & I went. It was quite a sight worth seeing that high pass, one
of the highest in the Alps which are regularly travelled, all covered
with snow.—It is true the sledge travelling was anything but the easy
motion one is told of, & which perhaps it is when the snow is hard—this
was continual up & down of the roughest kind. The sledges are about the
shape of the swings at a fair & just large enough for two opposite one
another to squeeze in. The road in many places was only distinguishable
by the posts which mark it out & we often went over the snow in some
other place. It was a rapid ascent of a winding narrow gorge, hemmed in
by very steep mountains on many parts of which of course the snow would
not lie but wherever it would lie it was a complete sheet, saving where
some torrent issued out from under the snow & after rushing or falling
between high white walls, ran under the snow again. At the top of the
pass is a little plain, with a sort of lake, as on the Mont Cenis, but
both much smaller. We trotted down on the other side very quick, & soon
came to the end of the sledging, for the enormous number of men with
spectacles on, who were clearing away the snow from the road, had made
greater progress on the north than on the south side. Even this short
experience of a field of snow under a bright sun made me fully
appreciate the necessity of the spectacles. We now trotted down the
remainder of the very long descent, & among other things crossed the
Devil’s Bridge but too rapidly to have more than the most unsatisfactory
glance at it—especially as I had been obliged to take up with a place in
the interior, & a middle place too. I therefore saw little except by
moments. For full half the distance to the lake of Lucerne the valley
continued a mere gorge, narrower than even that of Cauterets, with
literally no room at the bottom for anything but the rushing foaming
Reuss. The road of course was cut in the side of the gorge & had several
galleries cut in the rock: in one place it was roofed over on account of
the avalanches of which in that place there was visible proof. The
remaining half was a flat valley full of the richest pasture & the
greenest walnut trees, between mountains covered with green pasture &
green firs, & now & then perfectly perpendicular—but the tops of which
were never visible, & it came on to rain before we reached the lake. We
passed through Altdorf the scene of Tell’s doings with Gesler,2 which
are represented in fresco on the outside of an old tower as well as by a
very old-stile statue of Tell, in which ideal beauty certainly was very
little considered—an ugly little man with a cross-bow, caressing the
head of a very natural little boy playing with an apple. Fluelen the
port of Altdorf on the lake is about a mile further on—I may now say in
the lake, for the immense quantity of melting snow has so raised the
level of the lake that it has flooded all the places on its banks, & the
houses immediately on the lake Edition: current; Page: [494] at Fluelen,
including the two inns, stand up to their knees in water, i.e. their
ground floors are flooded & like the street in front can only be
traversed by boards resting on supports. One is not used to lakes taking
these liberties. When I arrived there was a steamer just starting for
Lucerne but I felt afraid of going on directly, arriving at Lucerne at
or after dark & going on next morning for another long diligence day. I
was fevered by the inside journey & excessively needed a walk, the
stoppage at Airolo having been entirely a lost day so far as the walking
(which is my real rest) is concerned. So considering what I thought my
angel would most wish me to do, I finally decided that a halt for
walking should be made somewhere before Paris & that as a better walk
could be had here than anywhere else on the road, this was the best
place to stop at. Accordingly I stopped at a rather pleasant German
country inn & had a five hours walk this morning in the valley & the
adjacent mountains & fir woods. It was fine at first but got showery
afterwards & very rainy at last so that when in the steamboat I passed
all down the lake seeing very little. The walk has done me much good. My
digestion seems to have recovered itself, though the cold & damp are
greater than ever, & through these two last days I have returned to my
former breakfast of eggs & bread, in which, on account of the tendency
to spit blood, I shall persist as long as I find that I can digest
it—but the proof that I can, is the most satisfactory thing as to health
that has happened to me for a long time. The first thing I did on
arriving was to take my place to Bâle for tomorrow—there perhaps I may
find a letter. I shall ask both there & at Strasbourg. And now darling
as we shall meet so deliciously soon I need not write anything more
except the utmost possible love & blessing from your

Sir—

I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your pamphlet entitled “War Notes”2
& of a letter asking my opinion of certain parts of it. I entirely agree
as every rational disinterested person must, in the object of your
pamphlet viz. to get rid of the monopoly of all posts of power both
civil & military by a particular class, & to open the service of the
state to merit wherever found. Edition: current; Page: [495] At the same
time I think the Adm. Ref. Assn.3 (with whom in this point you seem to
agree) entirely wrong in their assumption that the middle classes of
this country possess the eminent qualities which are wanting in the
higher. I am convinced that any public matter whatever, under the
management of the middle classes, would be as grossly, if not more
grossly mismanaged than public affairs are now. As you ask my opinion
more particularly of Fragm. 2, I will just say that the distinction you
draw between two kinds of martial qualities, the one grounded only in
the pugnacious instinct, the other in the higher moral attributes, the
former tending to decay as civilization advances, & requiring to be
replaced by the latter, appears to me perfectly just.

I am yrs faithfully

The inclosed portion of a set of Logarithmic Tables has been sent to me

peculiarity consists in their being calculated to a greater than the
usual number of decimal places. The author, Mr Heppel,2 was well known

have no right to ask you to take any trouble in the matter, but you will
probably be able by a few glances to satisfy yourself whether any use
can be made of them Edition: current; Page: [497] and to give the best
advice that can be given to his widow on the subject. It certainly seems
a pity that so much labour should be wasted. Your opinion would of
course be conclusive and I have no excuse for troubling you by asking
for it, except that I know of no other so good.

what should or should not be written about him. He is, or was very

Nov. 5 1855

Dear Sir

As you requested, I have tried to put on paper something if possible, at
once short and characteristic of our friend, and the few lines I inclose
are the best I have been able to do. It strikes me that yours has the
appearance of connecting him too exclusively with the single question of
colonial self government,2 and gives the idea of him as a man who
devoted his life to that Edition: current; Page: [499] one object, and
sacrificed his life to it—which, besides not being a true notion of him,
is in reality a notion inferior to the truth.3 You will judge whether I
have gone into the opposite extreme. It seems to me that as the
inscription will say that he died Secretary for the Colonies, it is
implied in the other things said of him that he did or tried to do
important things for the Colonies.

The short line, which has a somewhat sententious air, is intended to
imply, since it seems agreed not to express, that he held fast to other
opinions than those mentioned. Is there not something monstrous in the
fact, that in the case of a man universally applauded both for his
public and his private life, yet his conscientious opinions on what all
think the most important of all subjects, being diametrically opposite
to the common ones, are not even permitted to be alluded to in any
memoir or notice of him? Thus is buried with him his testimony to his
most important convictions because they differ from those of the mob.

I am afraid I have no letters but I will look & see, & if I have I will
send them.

I am, Dear Sir, yrs very truly,

TO AN UNIDENTIFIED CORRESPONDENT1

[After
Nov. 9, 1855

]

Dear Sir—

Almost the only biographical fact respecting Sir W. M[olesworth] which I
am able to communicate beyond those which are known to Edition: current;
Page: [500] the public is the history of his connexion with the Westr
Review2 which is both incompletely & incorrectly given in the newspaper
notices.3 Early in 1834 some of those who had been writers in the
original Westr & had not been connected with it under Col. Perronet
Thompson’s proprietorship,4 had been forming projects for a new & better
Radical review; which projects appeared to have come to nothing when M.
of his own motion (& quite unexpectedly on my part) offered to me to
start such a review at his own expense if I would either be the editor,
or would at least take the control & direction of it, with an editor to
work under me. Accordingly, the London Review was established on the
second of the two plans mentioned; Molesworth himself wrote in it some
very able articles, but it is not true as the Times said that he was his
own editor. After four numbers had been published Molesworth bought the
W. R. from Colonel Thompson & united it with the London under the title
of the London & Westminster Review. He continued to support it for about
a year & a half more, after which, it not paying its expenses, he, not
being willing to lay out more money on it, gave it over to me as
proprietor.

The papers are mistaken in saying that M. was acquainted with Bentham.
Bentham died in the very year5 in which M. came of age, and I feel sure
he never saw Bentham. These are the only particulars which I can think
of likely to be useful to you. I understand that there is a big article
in the J. des [Débats]6 on him which I have not yet seen.

Respecting the rights of women (not Woman) I need not say I wish you
success. My opinion on Divorce is that though any relaxation of the
irrevocability of marriage would be an improvement, nothing ought to be
ultimately rested in, short of entire freedom on both sides to dissolve
this like any other partnership. The only thing requiring legal
regulation would be the maintenance of the children when the parents
could not arrange it amicably—& in that I do not see any considerable
difficulty.

Molesworth died a firm adherent of anti-religious opinions.7 On the day
Edition: current; Page: [501] before his death he said to a friend: “You
know my opinions on religion; they were adopted on conviction, & I have
never concealed them. I rely on you for taking care that nothing
whatever admitting of a religious interpretation shall be inscribed on
my tomb.”

possession of Professor F. A. Hayek. Portion up to n. 15 published in
Hayek, pp. 131-33; at that time (1951) the MS fragment was missing.

Harriet Taylor, née Hardy (1807-1858), wife of John Taylor (1796-1849),
wholesale druggist. JSM first met Mrs. Taylor in 1830 in the Taylor home
at a dinner party at which W. J. Fox, J. A. Roebuck, and Harriet
Martineau were also present. The two later fell in love, and in the fall
of 1833 Mrs. Taylor went to Paris for a trial separation from her
husband. Eventually a modus vivendi was arrived at: she remained
nominally Taylor’s wife but had full freedom to see JSM at will. On a
number of occasions she travelled on the Continent with him. Her husband
died later in the year of this letter and in 1851 she and JSM were
married. Only two of JSM’s pre-1849 letters to her have been found
(Earlier Letters, Nos. 55 and 106), but many from subsequent years (see
this edition).

Many of Harriet’s letters to JSM, and detailed accounts of her relation
with him, are given in Hayek and Packe. But few of her post-1848 letters
to him have been found; JSM destroyed them in accordance with her
instructions.

2.
When they were away from each other, JSM and Harriet numbered their
letters in sequence for the period of separation. This is JSM’s eighth
letter to Harriet this month (see n. 3 below). The previous seven have
not been found.

3.
Early in Jan., 1849, when Harriet Taylor and her daughter Helen went to
Pau in southern France, JSM accompanied them as far as Paris and then
returned alone to England.

4.
Harriet suffered from rheumatic pains and a form of paralysis.

5.
During the summer of 1848 JSM had fallen and injured his hip. Treatment
for it affected his eyes, and he was lame and nearly blind for several
weeks. The following year he was still an invalid.

6.
John Austin (1790-1859), writer on jurisprudence, and his wife Sarah,
née Taylor (1793-1867), translator and miscellaneous writer, had been
close friends of JSM since 1819, when they were neighbours of Jeremy
Bentham and the Mills in Queen Square. For evidence of the long,
friendly association, see many of JSM’s letters to them in Earlier
Letters. Beginning about 1848, however, JSM’s friendship began to cool,
partly perhaps because of diverging political views, but more likely
because of Harriet’s dislike of Sarah Austin, and JSM’s impression that
she had gossiped about his relation with Harriet. In the first draft of
his Autobiog. (see Early Draft, pp. 147-48) he criticized Mrs. Austin
severely, but eliminated that criticism from the version published after
his death.

At this point the Austins had only recently returned from the Continent,
where they had chiefly lived since 1839.

by the Austins, whom he had known when they lived in Paris.

11.
It should be noted that JSM regularly uses the words “communist” and
“communism” to refer to the theory and practice of living in
communities, not as words connected with the system associated with
Marx, Lenin, and Soviet Russia.

12.
Sarah Austin.

13.
JSM had sent the Austins a copy of his Principles of Political Economy,
published April, 1848. According to Packe (p. 323), this was one of a
few gift copies which included a dedication to Harriet Taylor.

14.
Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800-1859), essayist and historian. The first
two vols. of his History of England had appeared in Dec., 1848.

2.
JSM had begun preparation of a 2nd ed. of the Political Economy, since
the 1st (April, 1848) was nearly sold out. He must have sent the first
instalment of the revised proofs to Harriet early in February.

3.
The passage reads: “Those who have never known freedom from anxiety as
to the means of subsistence, are apt to overrate what is gained for
positive enjoyment by the mere absence of that uncertainty. The
necessaries of life, when they have always been secure for the whole of
life, are scarcely more a subject of consciousness or a source of
happiness than the elements. There is little attractive in a monotonous
routine, without vicissitudes, but without excitement; a life spent in
the enforced observance of an external rule, and performance of a
prescribed task: in which labour would be devoid of its chief sweetener,
the thought that every effort tells perceptibly on the labourer’s own
interests or those of some one with whom he identifies himself; in which
no one could by his own exertions improve his condition, or that of the
objects of his private affections; in which no one’s way of life,
occupations, or movements, would depend on choice, but each would be the
slave of all.”

This was replaced in the second and all later editions by a less harsh
indictment of communism, which began: “On the Communistic scheme,
supposing it to be successful, there would be an end to all anxiety
concerning the means of subsistence; and this would be much gained for
human happiness. But it is perfectly possible to realize this same
advantage in a society grounded on private property; and to this point
the tendencies of political speculation are rapidly converging.”

For the full texts of these changes see Principles, App. A, p. 978.

4.
Pierre Joseph Proudhon (1809-1865), reformer, social critic and
anarchist. In his Qu’est-ce La Propriété? ou Recherches sur le principe
du droit et du gouvernement (2 vols., Paris, 1841-48), he had remarked:
“La communauté est essentiellement contraire au libre exercice de nos
facultés, à nos penchants les plus nobles, à nos sentiments les plus
intimes” (I, chap. 5, part 2, sec. 2, p. 284). For a discussion of
Proudhon’s ideas on communism, see George Woodcock, Pierre-Joseph
Proudhon (London, 1956), pp. 48-51.

with England. The respective social effects of the American Systems of
Government and Legislation, and the Mission of Democracy . . . (London,
1848), criticizing particularly the author’s “fanatic attacks upon
religion” and “his licentious assaults upon the sanctity of marriage.”
When the anonymous author replied (The Times, Feb. 7, p. 8) that he had
made no such attacks, the reviewer in his rejoinder cited this passage
from the book: “As to marital relations, no absolute right in one human
being to the person of another will be recognized, but the husband and
wife will be authorized to separate whenever incompatibility of temper
or any other circumstance, may in the estimation of the community, and
according to its laws, render a dissolution of the contract desirable.”

Republican party in the Assembly. Napoleon had been elected President of
the Republic in Dec., 1848; the Assembly was to be elected in May, 1849.
JSM’s optimism was not justified: the majority turned out to be
monarchists.

6.
Rome was captured by France in June and returned to the rule of the
Pope; Tuscany was recaptured by Austria; the Kingdom of Sardinia,
however, remained a liberal outpost.

7.
The liberal newspaper founded by Louis Adolphe Thiers (1797-1877),
historian and statesman, which in 1848 had supported Lamartine and the
Democratic Republican party. For JSM’s association with the paper and

Lord John Russell (1792-1878), whose first government held office from
1846 to 1852, reintroduced the subject of a Parliamentary Oaths Bill in
the House of Commons on Feb. 19, 1849. In 1847 Baron de Rothschild had
been elected to the Commons, but, as a practising Jew, could not take
the oath required for every member of Parliament containing the phrase
“on the true faith of a Christian.” In 1848 the House of Commons had
passed Russell’s Jewish Disabilities Bill, but the House of Lords
rejected it. Russell carried his 1849 bill also in the Commons, but it
was again rejected in the Lords. Not until 1858 was a compromise reached
with the Lords that permitted the seating of Jews in the Commons, and
not until 1866 were they admitted to the Lords.

12.
The Chairman was Maj.-Gen. Sir Archibald Galloway (1780?-1850), who had
served in the army in India, 1799-1841; as Director of the East India
Company, 1840-48; and as Chairman of the Board, 1849-50. The
Deputy-Chairman was Captain John Shepherd (1792-1859), who had been a

The Times, March 14, p. 8, printed from an American newspaper an account
of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s lecture on England, delivered to the Boston
Mercantile Library Association on Dec. 27, 1848. What JSM objected to
most in Emerson’s lecture is difficult to determine: it may have been
the praise of English culture (“they surpass all others in general
culture—none are so harmoniously developed”) or of English individuality
(“each man is trained to mind his own business. Personal eccentricities
are allowed here, and no one observes them. Each islander is an island
himself, reposing in quiet and tranquil waters.”).

12.
After defeating the revolutionists of 1848, the Austrian government

John Sterling (1806-1844), writer, for years JSM’s closest friend. There
are 19 letters to Sterling in Earlier Letters. See also Letter 11.

Archdeacon Julius C. Hare in his introductory memoir to his edition of
Sterling’s Essays and Tales (2 vols., London, 1848) had revealed that
Sterling, once Hare’s curate, had lost his faith. This led to a
vituperative attack in the religious press on the Sterling Club (of
which JSM was a member) for bearing the heretic’s name (see Letter 11).
The evangelical paper, the Record, started and maintained the attack for
months, beginning on March 8, 1849. For an account of the cause célèbre
see Tuell, John Sterling, chap. xv, “Sterling and the Religious
Newspapers,” pp. 351-71.

According to Waldo H. Dunn in his James Anthony Froude (Oxford, 1961),

appointment, in alarm over the stir created by Froude’s book, asked him
to withdraw, and he resigned the appointment.

“If there was any means by which Grecian independence and liberty could
have been made a permanent thing, it would have been by the prolongation
for some generations more of the organization of the larger half of
Greece under the supremacy of Athens; a supremacy imposed, indeed, and
upheld by force—but the mildest, the most civilizing, and, in its
permanent influence on the destinies of human kind, the most brilliant
and valuable, of all usurped powers known to history” (rev. of Grote’s

MS draft at LSE. Labelled in JSM’s hand on verso: Dr Ward—Nov2 1848 /
and reply in the spring of 1849 / For publication / J. S. Mill.
Published in Elliott, I, 140-47. Extensive excerpts from Ward’s letter
of over thirty pages (MS not located) are published in Wilfrid Ward,
William George Ward and the Catholic Revival (London, 1893), pp. 21-30.

William George Ward (1812-1882), Roman Catholic theologian and
philosopher, had met JSM in the fall of 1848; he had earlier pleased JSM
with a very favourable review of the Logic (British Critic, XXXIV [Oct.,
1843], 349-427; see Earlier Letters, pp. 603 and 664-65) and had also
reviewed Pol. Econ. for the Tablet in June, 1848. The editor of the
Tablet, Frederick Lucas, arranged the meeting, which appears to have
been the only such meeting, though the two continued to correspond from
time to time over the years.

2.
Ward’s letter had been written shortly after their meeting.

3.
In his letter Ward offered explanations for his having used “severe
language” in regard to JSM’s character in his Tablet review of Pol.
Econ.

4.
JSM’s Malthusian views on population had been the chief point of attack
in Ward’s review of Pol. Econ. See Wilfrid Ward, William George Ward and

Ward in his letter had asked JSM’s opinion whether the poor were better
off in Queen Elizabeth’s time than in the present, and recalled a
passage in Macaulay that dwelt on the alleged fact that “fish was a
luxury to the poor in old times, and is rejected by them now as
insufficient.” The reference is to Macaulay’s “Southey’s Colloquies on
Society,” originally published in ER, L (Jan., 1830), 528-65.

parliamentary agent of the Assembly of Lower Canada; closely associated
with WR under JSM; in 1843 emigrated to New Zealand, where he became a
judge of the Supreme Court. There are seven of JSM’s letters to him in

are 23 letters to him in Earlier Letters.

4.
William Empson (1791-1852), editor of ER, 1847-52. JSM’s relations with
him may well have been strained, since Empson’s article on Bentham in ER

In June, 1848, extremists of the left had attempted to overthrow the new
government.

22.
The Republican Government of 1848, under Cavaignac, had proposed free
compulsory education, but the Assembly did not approve.

23.
John Arthur Roebuck (1801-1879), politician. One of JSM’s close friends
in the 1820’s and early 1830’s, but estranged long since, probably
because of Roebuck’s disapproval of JSM’s attachment to Mrs. Taylor.
Years later Matthew Arnold in Essays in Criticism (1865) and Culture and
Anarchy (1869) attacked Roebuck’s smug satisfaction with things English.

support of Carlyle, Poulett-Scrope, and others, to combat the notion
that enforced labour of paupers should be made as unproductive as
possible.

For some time JSM had been urging Mrs Taylor to complete her projected
paper on the disabilities of women (see Letter 6), and the article that
appeared in the following year (“Enfranchisement of Women,” WR, LV
[July, 1851], 289-311) was the result of their collaboration. During
Harriet’s lifetime JSM led Hickson and others to believe that the
article was his; when in 1859 he included it in his collected essays
(Dissertations, Brit. ed. II, 411-49, Am. ed. III, 93-131), he
attributed its authorship to her, “my share in it being little more than
that of an editor and amanuensis.”

who put into effect a system of profit-sharing with his workers. He
initially described his system in a pamphlet Des Améliorations qu’il
serait possible d’apporter dans le sort des ouvriers peintres . . .
(Paris, 1842), an abstract of which JSM saw in Chambers’s Edinburgh
Journal, n.s. III-IV, (Sept. 27, 1845), 193-96. JSM refers to Leclaire’s
enterprise in his Pol. Econ., Book IV, chap. vii, sec. 5, 1st ed., and

Chadwick had forwarded to JSM a letter from the recently (1850) formed
Metropolitan Sanitary Association with a request that he should write a
reply for publication. The MSA letter and JSM’s reply, dated Feb. 15,
1851, appeared as: Public Agency v. Trading Companies. The Economical

Correspondence between J. S. Mill . . . and the Metropolitan Sanitary
Association on the Proper Agency for regulating the Water-Supply for the
Metropolis, as a Question of Economical and Administrative Principle

Quarterly Review, and for the next four years it was entitled the
Westminster and Foreign Quarterly Review. Later in 1851 Hickson arranged
for the transfer of the Review to John Chapman (see Letters 49 and 53).

As a result of the uproar caused by the so-called Papal Aggression of
1850, Lord John Russell introduced the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill in
Feb., 1851, a measure forbidding the assumption of territorial titles by
Roman Catholic priests. A few weeks later the government was defeated on
another issue, and Russell resigned on Feb. 22, but resumed office when
no one could be found to head a new government. The Ecclesiastical
Titles Bill was finally passed, though never enforced, and was
eventually repealed. The Russell ministry fell in Feb., 1852.

On May 20, 1851, George Mill had written from Funchal, Madeira, the
following letter to Harriet (MS at LSE): “Dear Madam, / Though I have
only heard at second hand, of your recent marriage with my brother, and
know nothing certain except the bare fact, I will not pass over such an
event in silence. My brother wrote to me a letter by the mail of April
9th [Letter 42] but not a word wrote he then, had he written before, or
has he written since of what I can only conclude he must have thought me
either uninterested in, or undeserving to know. I don’t know therefore
what changes your union will make in your mode of life, if any. It would
give me the greatest pleasure to hear that J. was free of the tether
which binds him to the City & you to the neighborhood of London.
Twenty-five years work at the I. House, believe me, is as much as any
man can well bear. I fear his generosity in money matters, has made his
leaving the office difficult, but surely with his power of work &
established reputation, he could earn enough money by writing for the
press much more easily & with much greater advantage to others than by
his present employment. I believe his work already published would have
given him an income if he had not made such easy bargains with his
publishers.

“I have not heard how your health is since I saw you in person & though
I then thought you looking much stronger than when I had seen you last,
you complained of it: pray let me hear sometime or other. If you feel in
me any part of the interest which I feel in you all, you will not leave
me in entire darkness.

“My own health continues pretty good. I am prosecuting the silk
business, though it advances slowly towards a profitable conclusion. In
the meanwhile I am endeavoring to earn a little money by writing. I have
a long art. in the last No. of the British Quarterly (on volcanos and
earthquakes) but there is nothing original in it.

“Believe me / dear Mrs. Taylor (I can’t forget the old name) / Yours
affectly / Geo G. Mill

“As I don’t know your present address I send this to Cross St. I am
writing to Hadjy. / Kind regards to Lily.”

Accompanying George’s letter was apparently one of similar purport to
Harriet’s son, Algernon (“Haji”), long a friend of George, a letter
which has not survived. Hayek, pp. 176-77, prints the draft of an answer
by Harriet dated July 5, 1851, which may not have been sent. The tone of
it is similar to that of JSM’s letter.

George Mill had evidently supposed that Harriet had been opposed on
principle to the institution of marriage, as is shown by the following
excerpt from his letter to Algernon Taylor of Sept. 27, 1851 (MS at LSE,
published in Hayek, pp. 179-80): “Believing that your mother would
generally rather discourage than encourage the marriage of others I
certainly was at first surprised to find her giving so deliberate an
example of marriage in her own case; in which moreover there seemed to
me less to be gained than in almost any marriage I could think of. . .
.” There is no evidence of any further correspondence by JSM with his
brother, who committed suicide two years later in the final stages of
tuberculosis.

3.
The following, perhaps a preliminary draft of this letter to George, is
at LSE: “Though I thought anything but highly either of your good sense
or good manners I had not so bad [the word “low” is written above “bad”]
an opinion of your feelings as to think you capable of the insolent
impudence of your letters to my wife & to Haji. I can even now only
suppose that you do not know what insult is, & you certainly cannot know
that anyone resents or is made indignant by it—for you actually seem to
suppose that you can write two such letters as those & be as good
friends [the phrase “on as friendly terms” is written above “as good
friends”] as ever with the persons to whom & of whom they are written.
Because you think fit, God knows why, to be in a rage with me, you write
a page of gross insults to my wife, setting up yourself truly as a judge
whether she has acted according to her principles—which principles you
say you do not know—& you crown the whole by selecting Haji as the
person to whom to address insults to his mother. Let me inform you, that
a person may be much superior to you, and yet too immeasurably below
her, to presume even to have an opinion on any action of hers—& that no
one but an inflated fool in a passion, incapable of conceiving either
what she is, or what he is himself would have had the insolence to write
that series of queries.”

Auguste Comte (1798-1857), pioneer sociologist and founder of
positivism, with whom JSM conducted an extensive correspondence between
1841 and 1847, though the two never met. See Earlier Letters. The work

thought of translating Comte’s writings. Upon learning from John Chapman
that Harriet Martineau was planning to translate Comte’s Cours de

part of it and invested the rest; later she divided the profits among
Comte, Chapman, and herself. Lombe died before Miss Martineau’s
translation was completed. It was published as Positive Philosophy of
Auguste Comte freely translated and condensed (2 vols., London, 1853).

In the autumn of 1851 the Mills had leased a house in Blackheath Park, a
suburb seven or eight miles out of London. Years later Charles Eliot
Norton described the house in a letter to Chauncey Wright (May 1, 1869):
“The house itself is a square, plain, brick house, in a little plot of
ground, of about the size of one of the Kirkland Street places [in
Boston], but with a characteristically English air and look in its
seclusion behind a wall, and trim thick shrubbery, and the ivy covering
one side and affording a shelter for innumerable twittering sparrows.
Over the way is a wide open space bounded far off by a blue outline of
distant hills.” Letters of Charles Eliot Norton, ed. Sara Norton and M.
A. DeWolfe Howe (2 vols., Boston and London, 1913), I, 329-30.

form it appeared as vols. V-VII in the collected edition of JSM’s works
(Leipzig, 1869-80), edited by Theodor Gomperz.

2.
JSM’s revisions of the third (1852) edition were especially extensive in

On April 6, 1852, George Thompson (1804-1878), the anti-slavery
advocate, and MP for Tower Hamlets, introduced a Bill that would extend
to the ballast heavers of the Port of London the same protection granted
to the coalwhippers under their Act (see n. 3). A select committee to
investigate the employment of ballast heavers was proposed, but not
appointed, and the Bill never came to a second reading. See Hansard,
CXX, cols. 783-92.

3.
An Act for the regulation of the employment of coalwhippers
(longshoremen who specialized in unloading coal) in the Port of London
was put into effect in 1843, re-enacted in 1846 and again in 1851, each
time with modifying amendments. A registry office was one of the
provisions. See M. Dorothy George, “The London Coal-Heavers: Attempts to

Methodist Quarterly Review between 1851 and 1854. A MS entitled “Spirit
of Positivism” in the Holmes Papers in the Library of Congress and
marked “Written for Edinburgh Review, 1853” may be another version of
the article he submitted to WR. The “Spirit of Positivism,” apparently
never published, was a summary of his earlier Meth. Q. Rev. papers. See
R. L. Hawkins, Auguste Comte and the United States, 1816-53 (Cambridge,
Mass., 1936). The Wellesley Index attributes to Holmes an article on
“Auguste Comte and Positivism” in the North British Rev., XXI (May,

highly in his Preface (pp. xxvi-xxviii), though the book is inscribed to

John Milton, Lalor presumably deleted the quotation, for it does not
appear in the book as finally published.

Preface to his book probably misled Lalor about the date; in his MS

rewritten in 1833 (MacMinn, Bibliog., p.47). Lalor corrects this in his

On June 6, 1850, JSM gave evidence before a Select Committee on
Investments for Savings of the Middle and Working Classes, printed in
Parl. Papers, 1850, XIX, pp. 77-90 (see Letter 29, n. 3), and reprinted
in Collected Works, V, 405-29. As a result of this committee’s work and
that of the Select Committee on the Law of Partnership, 1851, largely
through the efforts of Robert A. Slaney (1792-1862), MP, the Industrial
and Provident Societies Act of 1852 was passed. It provided for
settlements of disputes among partners without recourse to Chancery, and
further protected and encouraged co-operative societies. For JSM’s
comments on the act, see Pol. Econ., Book IV, chap. vii, sec. 6, and
Book V, chap. ix, sec. 7. For further details and information on other
acts of Parliament which protected and encouraged co-operatives, see P.
N. Backstrom, Jr., “The Practical Side of Christian Socialism in
Victorian England,” Victorian Studies, VI (June, 1963), 305-24.

4.
Royal assent was given to the Industrial and Provident Societies Act on
June 30, 1852.

5.
JSM has substituted the word “Partnerships” for “Societies.”

Econ., Book IV, chap. vi, sec. 5 and 6. For a general history, see Jean
Gaumont, Histoire générale de la Coopération en France (2 vols., Paris,
1923-24).

Louis Napoleon, proclaimed Napoleon III on Dec. 2, 1852; shortly
thereafter he issued decrees suppressing the co-operative associations.
Many survived this suppression, however. See Pol. Econ., Book IV, chap.

JSM’s ideas on representation for minorities and other problems of
representative government were later set forth in Thoughts on
Parliamentary Reform (London, 1859). Shortly after, he became an
advocate of Thomas Hare’s plan for proportional representation. See

MS draft at LSE. Published in Elliot, I, 175-76. In reply to
Molesworth’s of May 14, MS at Johns Hopkins.

Sir William Molesworth (1810-1855), one of the active philosophic
radicals. He served as MP 1832-41 and 1844-55, as first commissioner of
works 1852-55, and as Secretary for the Colonies in 1855. Out of
admiration for JSM, he provided financial backing for the London Review
of 1835 and bought the Westminster Review to merge it with the London in
1836. See Earlier Letters, and see Letters 250, 251, 252, and Appendix
to present volumes.

2.
Molesworth had asked JSM’s opinion of the subject of inheritance taxes
on land; Disraeli in the Commons on May 2 had claimed “the whole
principle of succession taxes unsound, especially as to land, because
they led to a partition” (Examiner, May 7, 1853, p. 296). For other
accounts of the debate on taxes, see ibid., May 28, p. 344, and June 18,
1853, pp. 392-93. For JSM’s views on partition, see Pol. Econ., Appendix
to Book II.

For JSM’s opinions on taxes, especially those on inheritance on land,
see Pol. Econ., Book V, chap. ii, sec. 3.

4.
William E. Gladstone, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, had presented
his budget and financial statement in April; he proposed to reduce the
income tax and extend the legacy duty to real property.

5.
JSM was undoubtedly referring to the Saint-Simonians. See Earlier
Letters for correspondence with Gustave d’Eichthal. The Saint-Simonians
believed that eventually the state would inherit all property; see C.
Bouglé and Élie Halévy, eds., Doctrine de Saint-Simon, Exposition

By the Bill adopted in Aug., 1853, the charter of the East India Co. was
renewed for the last time, not for a definite term, but at the pleasure
of the Government. The Constitution of the Court of Directors was
improved, the civil service was thrown open to competition, and power
was reserved to appoint a separate provincial government for Bengal. JSM
had given evidence before the Select Committee of the House of Lords on
India affairs the previous year (Parl. Papers, 1852-53, XXX, 300-332),
and had published two letters on the pending bill (“The India Bill,”
Morning Chronicle, July 5, 1853, p. 5, and July 7, 1853, p. 5). Five
years later, in 1858, a new Act made the final transfer of the East
India Company’s powers to the Crown.

“The great comet of 1853” attracted general attention during the last
ten days of August, when it was clearly visible in the western sky. A
few days before the perihelion on Sept. 1, just before sinking below the

magnitude,” its tail—in England—extended 8°-10°, only “a few degrees

JSM and his wife and stepdaughter had left England on Sept. 24 on the
recommendation of their physicians. He had been given a three-month
leave of absence, which the three spent at Nice. There Harriet suffered
a severe haemorrhage, of which she nearly died. JSM’s own condition did
not improve, but after moving Harriet to Hyères, where she remained
until spring, he began the return trip to London several days after
Christmas. This is the first of a series of 38 letters extending to
April 11, 1854.

Commenting on reports of undue interference of the court in the cabinet,
the Daily News (second leader, Dec. 24, 1853, p. 4), had said in part:
“Should it indeed prove true that human frailty had so far prevailed
with a high personage who has won golden opinions by his abstention from
party and political contests, his cultivation of the graces of domestic
life, and enlightened patronage of art and letters, as to induce him to
stoop to convert these opinions into an element of vulgar power—and
should the influence of a husband prevail to undo the work of sixteen
happy years, the grief of the devotedly loyal would be great, but the
hazard to all parties infinitely greater.”

JSM had begun a diary on Jan. 8 as an experiment to discover (entry for

having at least one thought per day which is worth writing down. . . .
It must either relate to life, to feeling, or to high metaphysical
speculation. The first thing which I am likely to discover in the
attempt is that instead of one per day, I have not one such thought in a
month; but only repetitions of thoughts, to us so familiar, that writing
them here would only expose the poverty of the land.” The diary, which
was terminated on April 15, is published in Elliot, II, 357-86.

Probably the following sentences in the essay “Nature”: “Even the love
of ‘order’ which is thought to be a following of the ways of Nature, is
in fact a contradiction of them. All which people are accustomed to
deprecate as ‘disorder’ and its consequences is precisely a counterpart
of Nature’s ways. Anarchy and the Reign of Terror are overmatched in
injustice, ruin, and death, by a hurricane and a pestilence.” (Three
Essays on Religion [London, 1874], pp. 30-31)

Charles de Secondat, baron de la Brède et de Montesquieu (1689-1755),
philosopher. Montesquieu, in his Spirit of the Laws (2 vols., New York,
1900), said that all was lost by secret votes in the Roman Republic,
that people’s votes ought to be public, but that votes of nobles or
senators cannot be too secret (I, 14-15). He also cites the observation
of Cicero, in De Legibus, Lib. I, xvi, and III, xv, that the laws which
made the vote secret toward the close of the Roman Republic were the
cause of its decline.

Russia demanded an explanation of the intentions of the British and
French fleets in the Black Sea. Clarendon, with the approval of
England’s allies, proposed a settlement of the Turkish dispute and
stated that if Russia did not accept she would be responsible for war.

John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell (1779-1861), legal biographer, Lord
Chief Justice and Lord Chancellor. He had been chairman of a royal
commission to inquire into the question of divorce; the investigation
led eventually to the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857.

10.
The Commission had reported its findings to the House of Lords during
the previous session. Based on its recommendation a Divorce and
Matrimonial Causes Act was introduced on June 13, 1854, but was
withdrawn on July 10. In the debate on the latter date Campbell was
still urging that divorce should be granted in cases of adultery of the
wife but not of the husband. “The moral guilt incurred by the husband
was the same, but in most cases it might be condoned.”

not be provided in all cases.”

Eventually published in the posthumous Three Essays on Religion. Harriet
had written: “About the Essays dear, would not religion, the Utility of
Religion, be one of the subjects you would have most to say on—there is
to account for the existence nearly universal of some religion
(superstition) by the instincts of fear hope and mystery etc., and
throwing over all doctrines and theories, called religion, as devices
for power, to show how religion & poetry fill the same want, the craving
after higher objects, the consolation of suffering, by hopes of heaven
for the selfish, love of God for the tender & grateful—how all this must
be superseded by morality deriving its power from sympathies and
benevolence and its reward from the approbation of those we respect.

“There, what a long winded sentence, which you would say ten times as
well in words half the length. . . .”

4.
Autobiog. See Letter 133.

Harriet had written: “Should there not be a summary of our relationship
from its commencement in 1830—I mean given in a dozen lines—so as to
preclude other and different versions of our lives at Ki[ngston] and
Wal[ton]—our summer excursions, etc. This ought to be done in its
genuine truth & simplicity—strong affection, intimacy of friendship, and
no impropriety. It seems to me an edifying picture for those poor
wretches who cannot conceive friendship but in sex—nor believe that
expediency and the consideration for feelings of others can conquer
sensuality. But of course this is not my reason for wishing it done. It
is that every ground should be occupied by ourselves on our own
subject.”

Taxes on Knowledge had held a soirée in honour of Milner Gibson’s
efforts on behalf of repeal of the tax on advertisements (see Examiner,
Feb. 11, 1854, p. 89). JSM’s hostility to The Times was of long
standing. Here the implication may be that such a powerful paper could
afford to pay the stamp tax, while liberal, or working-class papers
could not.

3.
The passage, which was an attack on some of Benjamin Jowett’s
recommendations in the Report, was published with one change. See next
Letter. As published it read as follows: “Whatever means of judging of
the moral character of the applicants may be adopted, I will venture to
express a hope that they may be of a different kind from those suggested
by Mr. Jowett; who would demand from every candidate for examination a
certificate of baptism, thus excluding even the Christian sects which do
not practise that rite; and would require, among other references, one
to a clergyman or a dissenting minister; which, as they would of course
give their recommendations only to those whose religious character they
approved of, would amount to the severest penalty for non-attendance on
some church or minister of religion, and would be in fact a religious
test, excluding many highly qualified candidates.” (Parl. Papers,
1854-55, XX, 95.)

JSM also objected to the requirement of a statement from a school or
college about the candidate; he pointed out that he himself would have
been excluded from such a competition, since he had never attended
school or college.

Jowett’s reply to the objections is printed in a long footnote (ibid.,
96-97) subjoined to JSM’s statement.

[Copied on last page, Charles Colman’s letter of June 17]

My dear Mill,

I have only just got your address, which enables me to write to you.

I am sorry to have to tell you that your mother died on Thursday Evening
last, suffering no pain at all.

I should not have taken upon myself to write to you now, but I do so at
Clara’s request to ascertain if it is your intention to act as Executor
or whether she shall do so, as she has been appointed jointly with you.

There is a letter addressed to you by your Mother which I should have
inclosed had I not feared it might have been lost, it is supposed to
contain her wishes relative to the disposal of certain articles not
mentioned in the Will, & if you are not likely to return soon it might
be desirable for you to give leave for its being opened with a view to
acting upon it.

If you wish to leave this matter in Clara’s hands I will render all the
assistance I can for its proper settlement, as I am remaining in town
for that purpose.

Will you kindly reply by return of post, as I am desirous of returning
to Clifton as soon as I can

I am

MS draft at LSE, as is also Gomperz’s letter of July 20 to which this is
a reply. Published in Heinrich Gomperz, Theodor Gomperz, Briefe und
Aufzeichnungen, ausgewählt, erläutert und zu einer Darstellung seines
Lebens verknüpft, I (all published, Vienna, 1936), 178-79, and in Lord
Stamp, “New Letters of John Stuart Mill. A philosopher in politics,” The
Times, Dec. 29, 1938. The MSS of JSM’s letters to Theodor Gomperz, which
Lord Stamp had acquired from a dealer to whom Heinrich Gomperz had sold
them, were destroyed in the bombing of Stamp’s home on April 16, 1941,
in which he lost his life.

Theodor Gomperz (1832-1912), Austrian philosopher and philologist, a
great admirer of JSM’s philosophy. He later supervised the translation
of JSM’s works into German. For an excellent recent study of their
relationship, see Adelaide Weinberg, Theodor Gomperz and John Stuart
Mill, in Travaux de Droit, d’Economie, de Sociologie et de Science
Politiques, No. 16 (Genève, 1963). For Gomperz on JSM, see his
“Lebenserinnerungen” in Essays und Erinnerungen (Stuttgart, 1905) esp.
pp. 33-38, and in the same volume, pp. 87-102, his “Zur Erinnerung an
John Stuart Mill (1806-1873),” reprinted from the Deutsche Zeitung, May
16 and 23, 1873.

2.
Gomperz’s translation of the Logic was eventually published as vols.
II-IV (1873-75) in the Gesammelte Werke (12 vols., Leipzig, 1869-80). In
a letter to his sister (July 6, 1854) he wrote of the Logic: “It is a
work which . . . I consider the most important philosophical achievement
of this half century, bound . . . to exert the most powerful influence
in all areas of thought” (trans. from H. Gomperz, p. 174). On Jan. 7,
1855, after completing the first draft of his translation, Gomperz wrote
his friend Heinrich Jacques (1831-94) a letter which contains a virtual
exposition of the Logic (Gomperz, pp. 195-206).

3.
John Stuart Mill, die induktive Logik, trans. J. Schiel (Braunschweig,
1849). Later the same translator did the complete book: J. S. Mill,
System der deductiven und inductiven Logik (Braunschweig, 1862).

his Saggi Storia, Di Critica e Di Politica (Firenze, 1868), pp. 282-325.
Beccaria’s treatise Dei Delitti e delle Pene (1764), trans. as On Crimes
and Punishments (1768), had been highly influential among the
Benthamites.

every grain of wheat is in point of fact both a seed, & an article of
food, until the very instant when it is either ground into flour, or
sown into the earth. It being the actual use & not the destination or
intention of using, which decides the question.”

5.
“Along with whatever any intelligence knows, it must, as the ground or
condition of its knowledge, have some cognisance of itself.”

6.
“The object of knowledge, whatever it may be, is always something more
than what is naturally or usually regarded as the object. It always is,
and must be, the object with the addition of oneself,—object plus
subject,—thing, or thought, mecum. Self is an integral and essential
part of every object of cognition.”

series of frescoes in the cathedral of Orvieto, begun by Fra Angelico in
1447 and completed by Signorelli ca. 1503.

Fra Angelico (1387-1455), the great friar-painter, who after his death
was named “Beato Angelico,” in honour of his religious virtues.

Stanza 9, line 4 of Shelley’s “Ode to Liberty,” one of JSM’s favourite
poems.

7.
Foreigners.

8.
Probably Dr. Richard Deakin (1808-1873), physician and botanist, who had
an MD from Pisa (1838). Murray’s Rome (1853 ed.) lists a Dr. O’Brien as
his successor, but Deakin is known to have resided at Rome 1860-72; he
published Flora of the Colosseum of Rome (London, 1855).

9.
The doctrine of the immaculate conception was declared an article of
faith on Dec. 8, 1854.

sentence of July 21, 1798, before the battle of the Pyramids: “Soldats,
songez que, du haut de ces Pyramides, quarante siècles vous
contemplent.”

4.
Although from his election to the papacy in 1846 Pius IX (1792-1878)
tried to introduce reforms in the government of the Papal States, the
Italian revolution of 1848 drove him from Rome. The republic was
proclaimed and had a brief existence under the triumvirate of Mazzini,
Saffi, and Armellini. United Italy was to become a republic with Rome
for her capital. The constituent assembly of Feb. 9, 1849, proclaimed
the fall of the temporal power of the popes. Garibaldi’s defence of Rome
succeeded for a time, but French forces finally captured the city.
Garibaldi left Rome on July 2, 1849, with several thousands of his
followers. The French restored the government of Pius IX, who reigned as
an absolute sovereign to 1870.

5.
A letter to Sidney Herbert, the Secretary of War, by Queen Victoria, to
convey to Florence Nightingale the message that she should tell the
wounded and the sick soldiers in the Crimea that the Queen felt deeply
their sufferings and admired their courage and heroism. See The Times,
Jan. 5, 1855, p. 6.

6.
Frederic Lucas, editor of the Tablet (Dublin) and MP for the County of
Meath, was closely identified with the Irish nationalist party. He had
come to Rome in the autumn of 1854 to protest a decree of the Archbishop
of Dublin, Dr. Paul Cullen (1803-1878), forbidding priests to interfere
in political affairs. Lucas had two interviews with the Pope, at whose
suggestion he wrote a “Statement” on the affairs of Catholics in the
United Kingdom. He died soon after his return from Rome. For JSM’s
earlier connection with Lucas, see Letter 40.

7.
Probably Abraham Hayward (1801-1884), miscellaneous writer; strongly
Tory in his views and in later life a bitter critic of JSM.

8.
Lady Caroline Duff-Gordon (d. 1875), wife of Sir William Duff-Gordon
(1772-1823) and mother of Sir Alexander Duff-Gordon, who in 1840 had
married Lucie, daughter of John and Sarah Austin. Because of JSM’s
estrangement from the Austins he might have found it embarrassing to
meet Lucie, whom he had known as a child.

9.
Probably Lady Jane Elizabeth Langdale (d. 1872), widow of Baron Henry
Bickersteth Langdale (1783-1851), Master of the Rolls, and a close
friend of Bentham and James Mill.

10.
Possibly of the family of Alfred Lyall (1795-1865), editor, author. His
brother George (1784-1853), merchant and shipowner, had been a director
of the East India Co.

“I had first planned and written it as a short essay in 1854. It was in
mounting the steps of the Capitol, in January, 1855, that the thought

to suppress convents and to tax archbishoprics and religious orders
whose revenues exceeded certain limits. See The Times, Jan. 2, 1855, p.

St., W. and St. Mary’s in Moorfields, the oldest Catholic Mission church
in the city.

3.
The S. Paolo fuori le Mure had been reduced to ruins in a fire on July
16, 1824. Large sums had been contributed by Roman Catholic sovereigns

8.
The Hon. and Rev. George Talbot (1816-1886), a younger son of Lord
Talbot of Malahide, was received into the Church in 1847 and was
ordained by Bishop Wiseman. His position at the Vatican was unique. He
was chamberlain, intimate friend, and constant attendant to Pope Pius
IX. Later his mind gave way, and he spent the last seventeen years of
his life in an asylum. During the years of Talbot’s illness the Pope
would not allow his rooms, which were near his own, to be disturbed or
occupied.

in Dublin, and quarrelled with Cullen about the Catholic University. He,
too, was in Rome in 1854.

12.
George William Frederick Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon, at this time
the foreign minister; he had earlier (1847-52) been Lord Lieutenant in
Ireland.

The Villa Mills, which abuts on the Farnese Gardens on the east, was
originally built by the Spada family in the 16th century. It was bought
by Sir Charles Mills soon after 1800 and in 1825 subjected to a “Gothic”
restoration. See Jordan Hülsen, The Forum and the Palatine, trans. Helen
Tanzer (New York, 1928), p. 79.

14.
Tasso, who died in the adjoining convent in 1595, is buried at S.
Onofrio; in the upper part of the garden in front of the church stands
Tasso’s oak; tradition has it that the poet used to meditate and study
under its shade; it was partly blown down during a storm in the autumn
of 1842 but had since gained fresh vitality.

15.
The portrait by Guido Reni of Beatrice Cenci (1577-1599), stepdaughter
of Lucrezia, second wife of Francesco Cenci (1549-1598), painted,
according to family tradition, on the eve of her execution.

16.
The portrait of Lucrezia Cenci was by Michelangelo Amerighi da
Caravaggio (1573-1610). Daughter and stepmother were beheaded on Sept.
11, 1599, for having plotted the murder of Cenci. Shelley’s tragedy The
Cenci (1820) was based on the famous case.

17.
La Fornarina, “bakeress”—the name given in the middle of the 19th
century to Raphael’s portrait of his mistress.

18.
Stendhal writes on visiting the Barberini palace: “[il y a] d’abord le
portrait de la célèbre Fornarina, la maîtresse de Raphaël, par Raphaël
lui-même. Ce portrait, sur l’authenticité duquel il ne peut s’élever
aucun doute, car on trouve des copies contemporaines, est différent de
la figure qui, à la galerie de Florence, est donnée comme le portrait de
la maîtresse de Raphaël, et a été gravé, sous ce nom, par Morghen. Le
portrait de Florence n’est pas même de Raphaël. . . .” From “Les Cenci,”
first published (anonymously) in Révue des deux Mondes, 4th ser., XI
(July 1, 1837), 10; again published, under his name, in a volume

the underground dungeon on the slope of the capitol on Dec. 5, 63 bc

9.
Pompeius Magnus (106-48 bc), Roman general, consul, who had made Syria a
Roman province; husband of Caesar’s daughter Julia. The statue, an
eleven-foot-high figure of Parian marble holding the globe, was found in
1553 in the Vicolo de’Leutari, near the Cancelleria. Legend has it that
it stood in the curia of Pompey, and that Caesar fell at its base.

Lucullus (d. 56 or 57 bc) Roman general, praetor, consul (74 bc). After
his retirement from active duty, he devoted himself to a life of luxury.
The tunnel is usually called the Grotta di Posilipo because it is cut
through the ridge of the Posilipo hill. It is 2,755 feet long and
affords a communication between Naples and Pozzuoli, where Lucullus had
many villas.

Carlo Poerio (1803-1867), Italian politician, brother of the poet and
patriot Alessandro Poerio (1802-1848). The brothers were exiled for a
time from Naples to Florence, but returned to Naples, where they
practised law with their father. Carlo, in 1848, became Minister of
Education, resigned, and took his seat in parliament, where he led the
constitutional opposition. After parliament was dissolved by King
Ferdinand in 1849, Poerio was condemned to 19 years in irons. The
exposure of the horrors of the Neapolitan dungeons by W. E. Gladstone in
1851 with special reference to Poerio awakened the indignation of
Europe; he was not released, however, until 1858. He became later the
vice-president of the parliament in Turin; he died at Florence, 1867.

A mountain near Rome which JSM had climbed earlier. In “Spring Flowers
in the South of Europe,” Phytologist, IV (Oct., 1860), 289-96, he
describes the ascent from Rome, past the Lake of Albano, and declares
the panoramic view from the top to be “surely the most glorious, in its
combination of natural beauty and grandeur of historical recollections,
to be found anywhere on earth.” Quoted in Henry Trimen, “[JSM’s]
Botanical Studies,” in John Stuart Mill: notices of his life and works.
. . . Reprinted from the Examiner (London, 1873).

3.
Bunyan’s work probably came to mind because JSM had just been reading
Macaulay’s essay “John Bunyan” (see next Letter, n. 6). JSM’s
recollection of the Pilgrim’s Progress, however, is inaccurate. The
wicket gate was not the entrance to Hell, though other details here have
some correspondence to Bunyan’s description of the mouth of Hell. Cf.
Pilgrim’s Progress, ed. J. B. Wharey and R. Sharrock (Oxford, 1960), pp.
10, 25, 63, and Matt. 7 : 13-14.

Santa Rosalia, born at Palermo in 1130, is supposed to have been a niece
of Roger II (1093-1154), King of Palermo, of the Norman Dynasty which
ruled from 1072. From the age of twelve, Rosalia spent some years in a
“damp and gloomy cave,” forty miles from Palermo, in solitude, prayer,
and penance. After being removed by an angel to Montepellegrino, she
lived in a similar grotto till her death in 1160.

14.
Villiers Meynell, known earlier as Frederick Villiers (b. 1801), was the
natural son of a Mr. Meynell and a Miss Hunlocke. Though not related to
the Villiers family he was sponsored by it. Enrolled at Cambridge, he
was later at Lincoln’s Inn, 1823-25. JSM had presumably known him as a
member of the London Debating Society. He served as MP for Saltash,
1831-32, and was elected for Sudbury in 1841, but the election was
voided by Parliament for bribery. The latter part of his life was
evidently spent on the Continent, and it is reported that he was living
near Genoa in 1864.

Pope Pius IX had proclaimed the dogma of the Immaculate Conception on
Dec. 8, 1854; the first copies of the papal bull were in the mail soon
after Jan. 14, 1855. The event was celebrated throughout the Catholic
world over the entire year 1855.

3.
Not otherwise identified.

4.
See the entry for Oct. 16, 1786, in Goethe’s Italienische Reise. Dido
was the daughter of Belus, king of Tyre, and the sister of Pygmalion.
After the murder of her husband Sychaeus by Pygmalion, she fled to
Africa and there purchased as much land as could be enclosed by the hide
of a bull, but she so cut the hide that she obtained enough space for a
citadel; this she called “Byrsa” (“hide”). Around it arose the city of
Carthage, of which she was thus the founder and first ruler.

5.
Palmerston had announced on Feb. 16 that Lord John Russell would
represent England at Vienna in negotiations with France and Austria to
serve as a basis for terminating the war in the Crimea. The negotiations
were difficult and dilatory; Russell finally resigned on July 13, 1855.

See Italienische Reise, Oct. 26, 1786. In the same entry Goethe says of
a Palladio sketch, apparently made from memory of the temple of Minerva,
that its inaccuracy “makes the whole a Palmyra-like monstrosity instead
of the great loveliness of the real thing” (p. 108 in the Auden-Mayer
translation).

9.
Presumably, JSM was at first under the impression that the Feast of the
Immaculate Conception was not a movable feast day, and was amused at the
postponement “in case of rain”—hence the reference to eclipses.

10.
Probably Vincenzo Mortillaro, Marchese di Villarena (1806-1888), author

In 734 bc the Corinthians drove out the Siculi, the original inhabitants
of Sicily. The new rulers, under Gelon, successfully resisted the
Carthaginians. Syracuse flourished and prospered under a succession of
enlightened rulers, but in 415 the Athenians began their harassment;
they besieged Syracuse in 414; Nicias erected three forts to command the
harbour; the war was fought with desperation, and the Athenians, under
Demosthenes, alternately succeeded and were repulsed. Ultimately the
Syracusans destroyed Nicias’ fleet and the rest of his forces on the
banks of the Asinarus, in 413. The abortive attempt of Athens to conquer
Syracuse signified the beginning of Athens’ ultimate downfall.

The Administrative Reform Association, an organization largely of
middle-class businessmen, was formed in the spring of 1855 as the result
of public concern over the revelations of gross inefficiency in the
supplying of the military forces in the Crimean War. This led to attacks
upon the manning of the whole civil service by political patronage from
the ranks of the aristocracy rather than from the business class.
Important leaders of the Association included Samuel Morley (1809-1886),
wealthy manufacturer, politician, and philanthropist; W. S. Lindsay
(1816-1877), shipping magnate, MP for Tynemouth and North Shields,
1854-59; and Sir Austen Henry Layard (1817-1894), the archaeologist of
Nineveh, MP for Aylesbury, 1852-57. Edwin Chadwick, though not publicly
active in the Association, may well have written one of its important
pamphlets, The devising hands and executive heads of the English
Government (London, 1855). The Association was influential in the
establishment of the Civil Service Commission in 1855. For reports of
the early meetings of the Association, see The Times, May 7, 1855, p. 6,
and June 14, 1855, p. 12. Charles Dickens was the chief speaker at a
meeting on June 27; The Times printed his speech in full the next day.
Thackeray prepared a speech for the Association for July 11, but did not
deliver it: see “Notes for a Speech to the Administrative Reform
Association in 1855” in The Letters and Private Papers of William
Makepeace Thackeray, ed. G. N. Ray (4 vols., Cambridge, Mass., 1946),

George Hastings Heppel (1793-1845), accountant, actuary of a life
assurance company “made his fortune as a fruiterer and was one of the
principal purveyors of ‘desserts’ to public dinners” (Gentleman’s Mag.,
n.s. XXIII [1845], 666).

Heppel’s widow had inquired of JSM whether the logarithmic tables worked
out by her husband could be published. They were figured to the twelfth
place, which was unusual at the time, since most such tables then were
to only the sixth or seventh place. Heppel’s tables had been partly
printed and stereotyped before his death. His son, the mathematician
George Heppel (d. 1908), prefaced the stereotyped plates with a
memorandum dated Nov. 17, 1855. See next Letter.

1.
MS at UCL.

2.
See preceding Letter. At the Jan. 28, 1856, meeting of the London
Institute of Actuaries it was reported that, as a result of De Morgan’s
intervention, Heppel’s logarithmic tables had been purchased and would
soon be published (Assurance Magazine and Journal of the Institute of
Actuaries, VI [1857], 180). See also ibid., X (1863), 82-83; apparently
the tables were in the end not published.

After a conversation with JSM about the possibility of his writing an
article for the ER on Molesworth, Henry Reeve in a letter to JSM on Dec.
29, 1855 (MS at LSE) made it clear that the family wished to have no
public mention of Molesworth’s anti-religious opinions: “Lady Molesworth
& Mr. Woolecombe (her chief adviser & Molesworth’s Executor) are of
opinion that whilst Sir William’s philosophical opinions derived chiefly
from the friends of Mr. Bentham form an essential & interesting part of
his character, they are bound with reference to his anti-religious views
to observe the same silence which he did himself during his life, & not
to bring prominently forward matters on which he said & wrote nothing &
which form no part of the papers prepared by himself for publication.”
