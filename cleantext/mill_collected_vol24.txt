January 1835 to June 1846


272.: SENIOR’S ON NATIONAL PROPERTY [1]
 SUN, 3 JAN., 1835, PP. 2-3

The “crisis” Mill refers to in the first sentence was precipitated by
the elevation of Spencer (Lord Althorp) to the Lords on the death of his
father in November 1834. The Whigs had already been weakened by the
resignation in May of Stanley and Graham over the proposed transfer of
Irish Church revenues to secular purposes, and by Grey’s resignation in
July over Irish coercion. Rather than see Russell succeed Spencer as
leader of the House of Commons, William IV chose to replace Melbourne
and called upon Sir Robert Peel to lead a minority Tory government; it
lasted only until April 1835. The anonymous pamphlet, discussing
possible ministerial policy, was by Nassau William Senior; it was
published in London by Fellowes in 1835. See also No. 275, on the 2nd
ed. of the pamphlet. The unheaded item is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “A leading article on a pamphlet (by Senior) entitled
‘On National Property, and on the Prospects of the Present
Administration and of their Successors’; in the Sun of 3d January 1835”

(MacMinn, p. 43).

a pamphlet has just appeared, well deserving of the attention of
electors, and of all who can exercise any influence over the dénouement
of the present extraordinary crisis; while, at the same time, it stands
broadly distinguished from any mere party production, and from works of
temporary interest, by containing views and principles applicable to all
time, stated and enforced with unusual energy and precision. The title
of the pamphlet is, On National Property, and on the Prospects of the
Present Administration, and of their Successors.—“The subjects of our
title-page,” says the author, “may appear, at first sight, to be totally
distinct. It will be found, however, that they are intimately
connected.” [P. 3.] In this he is not mistaken. The present
Administration, as he powerfully argues, cannot stand, mainly because
they will not, and cannot with honour, take such measures as the public
voice imperiously demands, on the subject of the “National Property,”
namely, the endowments of the Church, the Municipal Corporations, and
the Universities. Nor can Sir Robert Peel’s “successors,” whoever they
may be, have the slightest chance of maintaining themselves in power,
unless they are prepared to deal in the manner this author inculcates,
with that great subject.

The pamphlet is evidently from the pen of a practised writer, and one
well accustomed to the treatment of political questions. It would be
well if we could Edition: current; Page: [754] hope to hear his topics
discussed in the ensuing Session of Parliament, in the same tone of
thought and in the same manly and popular style.

The writer begins by one of the very best statements which we have seen,
in a small number of pages, of the philosophical argument for the right
of the State to control all endowments. This right, according to him,
extends so far, as to empower the Legislature, when the lawful claims of
existing incumbents shall have become extinct, to dispose of the
property at its own absolute will; guided of course by the same views of
public expediency to which the whole of its conduct ought to be
subservient, and under the further restriction of not divesting what was
intended for all generations, to the temporary purposes of one.

The cant of “spoliation”1 is disposed of in the following passage:

Some deny the right of the State to deal with the income of property
held in mortmain, on the ground that, what they call the church, as
distinct from the existing clergymen, is the owner of what they call
church property; that the episcopal lands belong to the bench of
bishops, not for the lives of the existing bishops, but for ever; and
that to declare that no bishop shall in future be appointed, and that
the revenues of the sees as they become vacant shall be applied to the
support of hospitals, would be an act of spoliation, even although it
could be demonstrated that such an application would be more useful, not
only at present, but permanently, than the present one. The answer to
these reasoners is, that to every spoliation there must be two parties,
the spoiler and the person despoiled. Now who, under these
circumstances, would be the persons despoiled? Our posterity? No; for
the argument assumes that they would be benefited. The existing Bishops?
No; for they are untouched. The persons who now have the power to
appoint bishops? Their consent must of course be obtained. If the
bishopric of Sodor and Mann had still belonged to the Athol family,
their right to appoint a bishop could not have been suppressed without
compensation.2 But, in the present case, the persons who have the right
to appoint bishops are the government, and their consent is
pre-supposed. The persons who might hope to be made bishops? They have
no vested interest susceptible of valuation; and, therefore, on the
grounds already laid down, cannot be heard. They have no more right to
protest against the suppression of bishoprics than subalterns have to
oppose a reduction of the number of field officers. Bishoprics no more
belong to the church, as an imaginary entity, distinct from the existing
churchmen, than pay and allowances belong to the army, as an equally
imaginary entity, distinct from the existing soldiers.

Others again contend that this property, having been originally given to
ecclesiastical purposes, cannot be diverted from them without improperly
violating the wills of those deceased persons who so dedicated it. In
Scotland, where a right of perpetual entail is admitted, this argument
might have some plausibility. In England and Ireland, where the Edition:
current; Page: [755] law “abhors perpetuities,”3 it is almost too absurd
for refutation. Our ancestors have had their full swing of posthumous
power. Their wills have been obeyed for centuries; in some cases,
without doubt, most beneficially; in others, more or less mischievously.
And will any one, out of a sentimental regard to their memory, maintain
that we have not now the right, or that, having that right, we are not
now bound to inquire, how far this obedience is now beneficial, how far
it is mischievous? or that we have not now the right, or that, having
that right, it is not our duty to make such changes as may augment the
benefit and remove the mischief?

If this argument were successful, the land would indeed belong not to
the living, but to the dead. Every successive generation would find
itself more and more confined by testamentary enactments; in many
instances the result of vanity, caprice, or ignorance; in others, framed
to meet the wants of an obsolete state of society, but in all cases
immutable as the laws of the Medes and Persians. One testator might
direct his estates to lie fallow for 10,000 years; another that they
should be cropped alternately in thistles one century, and in nettles
the next; and a third might order, as indeed has been done, that the
successive life-owners should for ever be chosen by lot.

[Pp. 15-18.]

The right of Legislative interference with endowments, which existed in
all cases whatever, our author considers it expedient, and therefore the
bounden duty of the Legislature to exercise, in three instances. The
first is, the reduction of the temporalities of the Irish Church, to the
amount adequate to the wants of the Protestant population, devoting the
surplus to the education, not of Protestants, but of the whole people.
[Pp. 23-37.] The second is the reform of Municipal Corporations, and the
employment of the property now under the control of those bodies, for
such purposes as after inquiry and mature deliberation shall be deemed
most useful. [Pp. 37-9.] The third is, the admission of Dissenters to
the Universities. [Pp. 39-42.]

We do not think it requisite to extract any of the passages in which our
author advocates these measures. Of their propriety, as soon as the
right is allowed, every rational mind is already satisified. We pass to
his observations on the present Ministry. After stating the obvious
grounds on which neither the reforms for which he has been contending,
nor any other of these demanded by public opinion, can be expected from
the Peel-and-Wellington Cabinet, he urges the following cogent reasons
why, even were they to become Reformers to the fullest extent which
could be required, they ought, nevertheless, to be driven from office,
and with disgrace:

But let us admit, merely for purposes of argument, that all this is mere
trick,—that the address to the electors of Tamworth is a counterpart of
the letter to Dr. Curtis,4—and that in the course of the next two
months, Sir Robert Peel will discover the justice, or at least the
expediency, of carrying all that he now declares he cannot consent to.

Edition: current; Page: [756]
It may seem that this is all which those who are not partisans, those
whose object is good government, without caring from whom they receive
it, can require; and, therefore, that although such an attempt would
deprive Sir Robert Peel of the aid of the Tories and of Lord Stanley’s
friends,5 it ought to give him that of all the independent Members of
the House. The obvious objection to this view, and it appears to us a
decisive objection, is, that it would countenance a degree of political
immorality, which in no state of society it would be safe, and in our
own it would be fatal, to sanction. It would sanction the opinion that,
in political warfare, faith is not to be kept with the country, with
enemies, or even with friends: that even among the leaders, on one side
at least of the House, the debates are a solemn show, in which the
actores fabulae wear the dresses and repeat the speeches which the
nature of the plot, and the rules of the stage, require; but as soon as
a new piece begins, have nothing to do with the characters which they
supported in the former one. It would proclaim, that a man making the
strongest protestations of his sincerity, may oppose, as a sacred duty,
measures which he knows to be not only expedient, but essential; may
drive, by his opposition, a part of the country to the brink of civil
war; and, the instant he has succeeded in turning out the proposers of
those measures, may introduce them himself, and then receive, from the
very persons whom he has forced out, support and power as his reward. No
nation could hope for public spirit, or even common honesty, from its
servants, if it were thus to remunerate falsehood and faction.

[Pp. 47-9.]

Besides this, there is another reason, which hitherto has not been
sufficiently insisted upon, and to which we invite, in the strongest
manner, the attention of all friends of good government, or of the
ancient doctrines of the Constitution:

But even supposing none of these insurmountable objections to exist, and
the new Ministry to be personally unexceptionable, there are
circumstances connected with their appointment which must deprive them
of the support of those who wish to consult the permanent interests of
the country.

It has for many years been admitted, that a Minister, though appointed
by the Crown, and nominally subject to be dismissed mero motu regis,6
without warning or explanation, really holds his office at the will, not
of the Crown, but of the two Houses of Parliament. He might be disliked
by the Court, he might be unpalatable to the King, it might be his duty,
indeed, to take steps which would necessarily produce one or both of
these results; but while he retained the confidence of the Houses of
Parliament, he was, according to the doctrine which prevailed until the
15th of last November, secure. And the necessity of this Edition:
current; Page: [757] principle is obvious. If a Minister held office at
the caprice of the Court, the Court, not Parliament, would be the field
on which the battles for power would be fought. The arts which succeed
in Courts, and the measures which please Courts, would be the arts and
the measures adopted. Despotic governments and constitutional
governments have each their peculiar merits and their peculiar
inconveniences; but this would be a mode of uniting the faults of both:
the slow and cumbersome machinery of the one, and the ignorance,
prejudices, corruption, and vacillation of the other. Even in
despotisms, where public opinion has acquired any force, deference to
that opinion prevents any capricious change. “C’est moi,” said Louis XV,
“qui nomme les ministres, mais c’est la nation qui les renvoie.”

Those whom this reasoning does not convince, may, perhaps, yield to the
authority of Mr. Burke. That acute observer, after dwelling on the
necessity that a Minister should be connected not only with the
interests, but with the sentiments and opinions of the people, adds, in
words which we might now adopt, “These are considerations which, in my
opinion, enforce the necessity of having some better reason in a free
country and a free Parliament for supporting the Ministers of the Crown,
than that short one, ‘That the King has thought proper to appoint them.’
There is something very courtly in this; but it is a principle pregnant
with all sorts of mischief, in a constitution like ours, to turn the
views of active men from the country to the Court. Whatever be the road
to power, that is the road which will be trod. If the opinion of the
country be of no use as a means of power or consideration, the qualities
which usually procure that opinion will be no longer cultivated. And
whether it be right in a State so popular in its constitution as ours,
to leave ambition without popular motives, and to trust all to the
operation of pure virtue in the minds of Kings, and Ministers, and
public men, must be submitted to the judgment and good sense of the
people of England. . . . When a Ministry rests upon public opinion, it
is not indeed built upon a rock of adamant; it has, however, some
stability; but when it stands upon private humour, its structure is of
stubble, and its foundation is on a quicksand. I repeat it again—he that
supports every administration subverts all government. The reason is
this: the whole business in which a Court usually takes an interest goes
on at present equally well in whatever hands, whether high or low, wise
or foolish, scandalous or reputable; there is nothing, therefore, to
hold it firm to any one body of men, or to any one consistent scheme of
politics. Nothing interposes to prevent the full operation of all the
caprices, and all the passions of a Court upon the servants of the
public. The system of administration is open to continual shocks and
changes upon the principles of the meanest cabal, and the most
contemptible intrigue. Nothing can be solid or permanent. All good men
at length fly with horror from such a service. Men of rank and ability,
with the spirit which ought to animate such men in a free State, while
they decline the jurisdiction of dark cabal on their actions and their
fortunes, will, for both, cheerfully put themselves upon their country.
They will trust an inquisitive and distinguishing Parliament, because it
does inquire and does distinguish. If they act well, they know that in
such a Parliament they will be supported against any intrigue; if they
act ill, they know that no intrigue can protect them. This situation,
however awful, is honourable. But in one hour, without any assigned or
assignable cause, to be precipitated from the highest authority to the
most marked neglect, is a situation full of danger, and destitute of
honour. It will be shunned equally by every man of prudence, and every
man of spirit.”7

Edition: current; Page: [758]
It is to be added, that if this principle is to be abandoned; if the
king is to be at liberty, merely because he thinks his own opinion
better than that of the nation speaking through their representatives,
to dismiss a government which enjoys the full confidence of the House of
Commons; if he is at liberty to do this at his own personal pleasure;
this absurdity follows, that his Majesty can act without a responsible
adviser in one point, and on one point only, that point being the most
important one which he ever can have to consider. The question, who is
responsible?—for some one must be responsible for the sudden and total
dismissal of a ministry,—has not been decided since our Constitution
assumed its present form, because in fact it has not been necessary to
raise it. A parliamentary vote or a resignation has preceded every
previous change. It has now been raised, and painful as the discussion
is, it must be decided. It must be decided with reference not merely to
the present emergency, not as a party or temporary question, but as one
of permanent constitutional law.

The king of course is not responsible. Royal responsibility is
inconsistent with monarchical government. Of course, too, it would be
absurd to fix the responsibility on those persons who may be supposed to
have had private access to his Majesty’s ear. The country does not
recognise such advisers, either for good or for evil. The domestic
comfort and privacy of the sovereign require that those who, filling no
political office, are familiarly about his person, should be considered
to be, as in reality it is their duty to be, unconnected with politics.
The persons on whom this responsibility falls most naturally and most
usefully, are those who are to profit by the act in question, the
immediate successors of the dismissed administration. If it be once
understood that, whether really consulted or not, they are to be
considered as having advised the measure which, by their acquiescence
they have adopted, and that no administration, for whom a vacancy has
been made by a court intrigue, or by mere personal predilections or
dislikes, or by caprice, or, in short, on any ground of which Parliament
does not recognize the sufficiency, however personally eligible, will
receive parliamentary support, we shall return to our established
system, and the events of last November will be a warning instead of a
precedent.

It may be asked then, what was the Duke of Wellington to do when he was
summoned from the hunting-field at Strathfieldsay, and the King threw
himself on his loyalty?8 Was he to refuse to aid the King in his
difficulties?

Unquestionably it was his duty so to refuse.

It was his duty to say, not in words, but in substance, “Four months
ago, your Majesty appointed Lord Melbourne your minister. The country
approved of the choice, and nothing has occurred to diminish its
approbation. I cannot be a party to any change which has even the
appearance of having originated in intrigue, or caprice, or in any
personal feelings whatsoever.”

It will be the duty of the houses of parliament to say, “We will not
bind on our necks, and on those of our posterity, a yoke from which the
country has worked itself free. We will not abandon the trust which the
practice of the Constitution has reposed in us of deciding by what party
the government shall be carried on.”

It is now the duty of the electors, since Sir Robert Peel is blind
enough to appeal to them, to proclaim, “We will return those men, and
those men only, who will maintain their station as representatives of
the people. We have not broken the chains of an oligarchy to put on
those of a court. We will not sanction a single step towards a return to
those unhappy times, when the sovereign was the real minister, and
placed and displaced at pleasure, the puppets who bore the name.”

[Pp. 50-9.]

Edition: current; Page: [759]
Considering it as certain that the present Administration cannot stand,
the author proceeds to examine what ought to be the conduct of their
successors. And first, on what terms ought they to take office? On this
point the writer is most explicit. A creation of Peers (in his opinion
Peers for life), sufficient to re-establish harmony between the two
Houses, ought to be an absolute condition. This he shows with great
force and spirit. [Pp. 64-71.] And if, as there is reason to believe,
his pamphlet speaks the sentiments of a part at least, if not the whole,
of the late Administration, so strong a declaration on this point is
highly important.

The writer thinks, and, in our opinion, for unanswerable reasons, that
Peers should be eligible to the House of Commons, otherwise the creation
of so many popular Peers might for ever exclude from the other House a
large proportion of those who would be its most valuable members. [P.
69.] And what Reformer does not wish that Earl Spencer, the Earl of
Durham,9 or Lord Brougham, could again make themselves heard in that
assembly in which the direction of public affairs, now and hereafter,
does and will mainly reside?

To the observations contained in the pamphlet on giving official seats
to Ministers [pp. 72-81], on paying the Catholic Clergy [pp. 87-110], on
Secondary Punishments [pp. 110-13], and other important subjects, we can
only call the reader’s attention. He will find them well worthy of
perusal and consideration.


273.: FLOWER’S SONGS OF THE MONTHS [2]
 EXAMINER, 4 JAN., 1835, P. 4

Having in No. 248 (20 Apr., 1834) noticed the publication of the first
four of Eliza Flower’s Songs of the Months, Mill here seizes the
opportunity to eulogize the separate publication of the completed
series. He almost certainly refers to this review in asking Fonblanque
on 25 Dec., 1834: “Could you insert the enclosed in your next paper?”
(EL, CW, Vol. XII, p. 246.) It appeared in the “Music” section of the
Examiner, headed: “Songs of the Months. A Musical Garland. [London:]
J.A. Novello, and Charles Fox. [1834.]” The songs for May to December
are: “A May Day Memory” (May; words by Alexander Hume); “A Summer Song
for the Open Air” (June; words by Catherine Partridge); “The Wanderer’s
Lullaby” (July; words by Sarah Flower Adams); “The Harvest of Time”
(August; words by Harriet Martineau); “An Autumn Song” (September; words
by Mary Howitt); “Falling Leaves” (October; words by Sarah Adams); “
‘Come to My Home’ ” (November; words by Sarah Adams); and “Winter
Minstrelsy” (December; words by Charles Pemberton). It is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A notice of Miss Flower’s ‘Songs of the Months’
in the Examiner of 4 January 1835” (MacMinn, p. 43). There is no bound
volume of the Examiner in Mill’s library after that for 1834.

Edition: current; Page: [760]
this is a republication of the beautiful songs which have appeared in
the successive numbers of the Monthly Repository for the year now
closed; and the first four of which we noticed on a former occasion. As
now reprinted, they form one of the most agreeable of Christmas presents
to a lover of music.

The words of the songs (except those for July and August) are
characteristic of the months to which they belong; and the music is in
all cases characteristic of the words. The song for “March” (formerly
noticed by us) and that for “August,” are among the most impressive and
elevated compositions which have recently appeared, and only require to
be generally known, in order to assume, at once, in the estimation of
all judges of the art, the high rank which belongs to them. “July,”
“October,” and “November,” each of consummate beauty in its kind, are
easier of execution, and likely to be greater favourites with the more
numerous class. “May” is a sweet and simple ballad. We have expressed
our high admiration of “February” in a former paper. “September” is an
elegant and graceful duet. “June” (also intituled “A Summer Song for the
Open Air”) is a chorus for children’s voices.

We cannot with justice omit to observe that the songs are more truly
songs, that is, better adapted for music than almost any which have
appeared since those of Scott, the great master in this (and perhaps in
no other) kind of poetical composition.1

We hope that the sale of this “musical garland” will afford an ample
remuneration to the conductor2 of the excellent and perpetually
improving periodical in which both the poetry and music originally
appeared.


274.: THE WORD “DESTRUCTIVE”
 GLOBE AND TRAVELLER, 6 JAN., 1835, P. 2

Here Mill returns to the Globe and Traveller for the first time since
1823. This unheaded leader is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A
leading article on the word ‘Destructive’ in the Globe of 6th January
1835”

(MacMinn, p. 43).

it is amusing to see how invariably, in one age after another, party
frenzy frustrates its own purposes in the self-same manner. Not only
there is no variety in its weapons, but it invariably uses all of them
so indiscriminately as to blunt their edge. One of its most universal
devices is calling bad names. “Give a dog a bad name and hang him,”
might be taken for its motto. But the bad names do not Edition: current;
Page: [761] long remain bad; for as they are presently applied to all,
without distinction, who are obnoxious to the party coining the names,
they are soon shared by so many persons of the highest public and
private worth, that no one is either ashamed or afraid of a reproach
borne in common with such men, and the names originally opprobrious are
in a short time avowed and even boasted of. “Whig” and “Tory” were
originally terms of abuse, levelled exclusively at the lowest populace.1
Every one remembers the name “Gueux,” or beggars, applied in derision by
the partisans of the Duke of Alva to the first Flemish insurgents, and
very soon adopted by themselves as a title of honour.2 Whoever is old
enough to remember the first invention of the term “Radical,”3 and the
terror with which almost every person above the rank of a working man
deprecated the application of it to himself, will be at no loss for a
modern instance similar to these ancient ones.

The same game is now played over again with an abusive epithet of more
recent coinage, and, as we already begin to see, with the same result.
When the term Radical had ceased to terrify any one, the word
“Destructive” was invented to supply its place;4 and for a short time a
distinction was kept up—many persons were called Radicals who were not
called Destructives, and at first nobody was willing to confess himself
a Destructive. But this term of opprobrium has run its course more
rapidly than any similar term ever did. Already every person is called a
Destructive who is not a Tory, who is not willing to be governed by
Tories. The majority of the last parliament, the majority of the
parliament which is to come, the enormous majority of the electors, and
of the middle classes generally, a large portion of the landed and the
largest portion of the commercial aristocracy of the United Kingdom, are
all Destructives. There are but two parties now, Destructives and
Conservatives. The consequence is, that no one who does not call himself
a Conservative will feel the least objection to being called a
Destructive, and we may soon expect to see even addresses to electors
from persons calling themselves “Rational Destructives.”

In the meantime, if we may be permitted to put the question, pray what
is meant by calling all the Reformers, except those after the fashion of
Sir Robert Peel, Destructives? What does the word signify?

If it means people who are for the destruction of property, there are no
such Edition: current; Page: [762] people. At no time, in no country,
not even in France during the height of the Revolution, were there more
than a handful who wished even to reform, much less to destroy, the laws
of property.

If it means people who are for the abolition of monarchy and the House
of Lords, and the establishment of an American republic, very good and
wise men have thought that this would be desirable; but even of these we
never saw or heard of one who wished the experiment tried in this
country in defiance of the old and deep-rooted national attachments to
those institutions. As for mere adventurers and demagogues, these are
the last objects they would choose, because the last which would hold
out any hopes of successful agitation. The people of England are not led
by words. They carry even to a fault their indifference to abstract
principles. The only change which they desire, or even tolerate, is the
reform or removal of something which is doing them positive and visible
harm. They make no alterations for the sake of symmetry; when an
institution works well, that contents them. They want a House of Commons
fairly chosen by the people, and a House of Lords so composed as to
assist and not thwart the purposes of such a House of Commons. Give them
these, and they do not fear that the King will ever make himself an
obstacle to the deliberate wishes of two such houses, backed by the
opinion of the nation.

Who, then, are the Destructives? The Times says they are all who are for
the ballot, for the separation of church and state, for the repeal of
the union, and, it has the modesty to add, for an “equitable adjustment”
with the fundholder.5 (By this last test Sir James Graham, the Quarterly
Review, and full one half of the Tory county members, are Destructives.)
To the above catalogue the Standard adds all who are for corporation
reform, or for the repeal of the corn laws.6 The Times has not yet come
to this; but, fair and softly, it soon will—nous l’attendons là. The
Standard is in the right, and we will add a few more categories to the
list. All who wish the reform bill to be made effectual by the
improvement of the registration clauses, by disfranchising the corrupt
freemen of such places as Norwich and Liverpool, and by getting rid of
such of the smaller constituencies as have already become, beyond hope
of redemption, close or rotten boroughs—all who wish that taxes should
be taken off the necessaries of the poor instead of the luxuries of the
rich—all who wish for local courts, or any other substitute for the
irresponsible and incapable jurisdiction of the county magistracy—all
who wish to see any measures introduced for the relief of the Dissenters
but such as the Dissenters will indignantly reject—all who wish to see
Edition: current; Page: [763] the Universities reformed: those places
where the sons of English gentlemen are steeped in the foulest mire of
Toryism, and then sent forth to govern a country which has cast forth
Toryism with disgust—all who wish to see the church of England reformed,
and all rational persons who do not wish to see it destroyed—all who
wish to see the church of Ireland reduced to reasonable dimensions, and
the national property, which it has so long misused, employed for the
benefit of the unhappy oppressed Irish people, whom by combined injury
and insult it keeps always on the very verge of rebellion—and, finally,
all who will not endure that a dignitary of something calling itself a
Protestant and English church shall go forth with armed men and
assassinate the children and neighbours of a poor widow because she will
not any longer give to him of her scanty substance the wages of a
degrading tyranny.

These are the Destructives; for these are the enemies of the present
ministry. Electors of the United Kingdom, let such Destructives, and
none but such Destructives, have your votes.


275.: SENIOR’S ON NATIONAL PROPERTY [2]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 6 FEB., 1835, P. 2

See No. 272 (3 Jan., 1835) for Mill’s review in the Sun of the 1st ed.
of Senior’s pamphlet; the 2nd ed. (London: Fellowes, 1835), from which
Mill here quotes, had quickly followed on its heels, and there were two
further editions in 1835. The unheaded leader is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “A leading article in the Morning Chronicle of 6th (?)
[sic] February 1835, on the 2nd ed. of Senior’s pamphlet”

(MacMinn, p. 43).

in our paper of the 2d January1 we gave several extracts from an able
pamphlet recently published, On National Property, and on the Prospects
of the Present Administration, and of their Successors. The second
edition of this important tract has just appeared. It contains much
additional matter, in no way inferior either in thought or style to what
preceded; and we recommend the whole pamphlet as a text-book to the
liberal Members of Parliament—a compendious statement of many of the
principles and arguments which will be their strongest weapons, both of
offence and of defence, in the approaching conflict with all the
remaining strength of the Tory party.

The right of the State to employ what is called Church and Corporation
Property for whatever purposes of public utility it deems most
expedient—that Edition: current; Page: [764] principle, involved in Mr.
Ward’s famous resolution,2 and the dread of which, in high quarters, has
raised the present Ministry to its “little brief authority”3—is stated
and enforced in the pamphlet, calmly, philosophically, and
uncompromisingly, as a deduction from the very nature and tenure of
property itself. The utter incompatibility, both with the principles of
the Constitution and with all good Government, of the strange
proceedings which we have lately witnessed, the dismissal of one
Ministry, and the appointment of another, ex mero motu regis,4 is
powerfully shown; and the hack sophisms of the Conservatives to justify
this stretch of authority are triumphantly demolished.

We quote from the new matter of the present edition, the following
notice of an article in The Standard,5 in which our Contemporary takes
off the mask, and avows the intention of its party to take back in one
form those powers of misgovernment which, by the passing of the Reform
Bill, they have lost in another:

If the present attempt is acquiesced in, it will be a precedent, and a
precedent of more than even its apparent force. It will be a precedent
which will at least begin by bringing us back to the times of the
Stuarts. The organs of the present Ministry have been forced to speak
out on this subject; they have been forced to declare, that “although
before the Reform Bill, the House of Commons did in practice apparently
exercise a veto upon the appointment of the Ministers of the Crown, the
Reform Bill,” (by diminishing the influence of the Crown and the
aristocracy in the House of Commons) “has brought us back to the theory
of the constitution, the power of the King in choosing his advisers as
unrestrained as that of the House of Commons in arranging the order of
its proceedings6—the reciprocal independence of the three branches of
the Legislature.”

This, then, is the manner in which the Tories propose to work the Reform
Bill. This is Sir Robert Peel’s “final and irrevocable settlement of a
great constitutional question.”7 The influence given to the people in
the House of Commons is to be neutralized, indeed, much more than
neutralized, by depriving that house of all control over the other
branches of the Legislature. The King is to have the same unrestrained,
unquestioned power of appointing, dismissing, and changing the whole
body of public functionaries which the House of Commons has of deciding
whether it will take motions or petitions for its twelve o’clock
sittings. We are to return to the reign of prerogative. The King is, of
course (for that is equally within the forms of the constitution), to
refuse his assent to any Bill which Edition: current; Page: [765] may
displease him. The Commons (for that is also the theory of the
constitution) are to commence the session by a statement of their
grievances, and postpone the grant of supplies until his Majesty has
been pleased to redress those grievances. The three branches are to act
independently. The great edifice of parliamentary government, which it
has taken centuries to build up, and which we fondly thought that the
Reform Bill had rendered complete, but which even without that bill, was
supposed to be, at least, secure, is to be destroyed, because that bill
has diminished the influence of the Crown and the aristocracy in the
House of Commons. When the anti-reform majority of the House of Lords
allowed, by their secession, that bill to pass, the country little
thought what was their mental reservation. Without relying much on their
prudence, it still did not suspect them of so insane a scheme as that of
making amends for the Reform Bill by setting up prerogative against the
people, and throwing us back, by a recurrence to what they choose to
call the theory of the constitution to the state of things which
preceded the events of 1643.

In justice to our adversaries, we must admit that this desperate defence
is forced upon them. They would have much preferred that, instead of
addressing the King “on the exercise of his undoubted prerogative,” they
had had no such congratulations to offer. They felt the danger of
assuming such a position, and evaded it, as long as evasion was
possible, by every sort of artifice and falsehood. First, they declared
that Lord Melbourne resigned; then that he admitted the impossibility of
going on; then that, at least, he confessed that his administration was
falling to pieces through internal dissensions. And it is only when
these pretences have been swept away, that they take refuge in the
Gothic citadel of prerogative, and turn against the country, and in the
nineteenth century, the weapons forged by the Tudors and the
Plantagenets.

[Pp. 66-9.]

The following passage on the theory of “political inconsistency” is also
new:

When a statesman supports a measure which he formerly opposed, his
conduct may be accounted for on any one of the three following
suppositions:—1. An intervening change in public affairs. 2. Error. 3.
Interest. It may happen, and indeed must happen frequently, that such a
change has occurred in public affairs, since the period of his
opposition, as to render beneficial what would previously have been
injurious. When no such change in the circumstances of the case has
occurred, the supposed alteration of conduct must necessarily be
attributed to more personal causes. It must be attributed either to
Error, or to Interest. He may admit that his former opposition was a
mistake, and that he has been subsequently convinced, by facts of which
he was not then aware, or by arguments which he had not then
sufficiently considered. But if this explanation be not offered, or be
not accepted, the only remaining solution is, that interest (using that
word as comprehending not only pecuniary interest, but the acquisition
or retention of power, or fame, or popularity, or the gratification of
party friendship, or of party enmity), was the motive, either of the
former opposition or of the present advocacy.

A change of conduct, which is accounted for by the first of these three
suppositions, namely, by a change in the circumstances of the case,
cannot be called an inconsistency. The real inconsistency would lie in
persisting in a course for which the motive had ceased. With respect to
the second supposition, the degree in which a public man’s reputation,
for knowledge and intelligence, ought to suffer from his defending his
present conduct, by acknowledging that he was formerly mistaken, is
subject to no general rule. If the matter was not one of such importance
as to have required his earnest attention, or the facts or reasonings
which now show him to have been in error were not then before the
public, he is readily excused. Lord Grenville did not sink in public
estimation when he confessed that the support which, during the whole of
his political life, he had given to loans for the Edition: current;
Page: [766] purpose of supporting a Sinking Fund, was founded in error.8
That it was so founded, has been demonstrated; but it was not suspected
by any one, when that most absurd system of finance was first adopted.
But if the question at issue was of great importance, and if all the
facts and arguments, necessary for its decision, were notorious, a
statesman who is forced to acknowledge that he erred from ignorance of
those facts, or neglect or incapacity of understanding those reasonings,
may make a useful subaltern, but can scarcely maintain the post of a
leader. The last of the three supposable cases, namely, that the measure
in question was formerly opposed, or is now supported, from interested
motives, is one which few men will venture to avow. In a sound state of
public morality, such conduct would exclude from confidence and from
power every person convicted of it. In the present state of feeling in
England such an imputation, though always felt as an objection to the
man who is stained by it, is not considered a decisive objection, unless
the matter with respect to which it occurred was one of great public
importance. So much latitude is allowed to faction, there is so much
sympathy with party affection and party hatred, so little of public
spirit is hoped for from public men, that in comparatively trifling
measures, when introduced by a political adversary, to have knowingly
opposed what was right, is considered a venial offence. But, loose as
our morality is, we have not yet gone so far as to sanction such conduct
with respect to those few questions on the right decision of which the
welfare of the community depends; and as public morality is, on the
whole, improving, we believe that it never will be sanctioned. If our
belief were otherwise, we should indeed despair of the prospects of the
country. The conduct which only disgusts in a demagogue would be ruinous
in a Minister.

We will now endeavour to apply these principles to the subjects
immediately before us. The great questions which we have been
considering, are matters of the utmost importance, not only to the
welfare, but to the existence of the empire. No event has taken place
since they were last before Parliament in the slightest degree affecting
them. Nothing new has been discovered respecting either the facts of the
case, or the inferences to be deduced from them. If Sir R. Peel should
now support those measures which, in the last session, he so resolutely
resisted, he cannot plead, in justification, that the circumstances of
the case are changed, or, in mitigation of punishment, that he was
formerly mistaken. He had before him all the materials for coming to a
right decision, and no one imputes to him mental deficiency. It must be
admitted, tacitly or expressly, that either his former reluctance, or
his subsequent concession, was founded on interest; that he knowingly,
and intentionally, and on matters of the utmost importance, sacrificed
the country to his party or to himself. And we repeat, that to sanction
such conduct would be fatal.

[Pp. 52-6.]

We conclude in the forcible words of the author of the pamphlet:

It appears, therefore, that under any combination of circumstances, the
present Administration cannot stand. It can stand only on these
suppositions. First, that the present Ministers are willing to sacrifice
all the reputation and the self-respect which alone can render the toils
of office endurable: secondly, that the country is willing to sanction a
degree of political profligacy, which even the tools of a despotism
would not venture: and, thirdly, that the monstrous doctrine is to be
admitted, that no one is responsible for the most dangerous of all
possible exertions of the royal prerogative, the unforeseen and total,
Edition: current; Page: [767] and, unless indeed its popular measures
were the provocation, the unprovoked, dismissal of a popular
Administration. Any one of these objections would be fatal. What then
must be the effect of their combination?

[Pp. 70-1.]


276.: BRIBERY AND INTIMIDATION AT ELECTIONS
 GLOBE AND TRAVELLER, 12 FEB., 1835, P. 2

This unheaded leader is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A leading
article in the Globe of 12th February 1835 on the bribery and
intimidation at elections”

(MacMinn, p. 43).

the bribery and intimidation which have been practised during the late
elections,1 to an extent almost exceeding former example, must engage
the attention of parliament immediately after its meeting. The members
may be assured that upon the spirit in which this subject shall be taken
in hand by them not a little of the future history of their country, and
very much of their own prospects as public men, will depend.

The ways of an unreformed parliament ought not to be those of a reformed
one. Before the Reform Bill there never was any serious purpose of
checking bribery or intimidation: they were the two props on which the
system rested, and no one wished to see them weakened. Whether a member
had been elected by honest or by wicked means was a question between him
and his competitor, not between the culprit and the State. If the rival
candidate, after having thought it worth while to spend some thousand
pounds for a first chance of getting into parliament, thought it worth
while, on the failure of that, to spend as much more for the second, he
petitioned. If he did not, no one else did, nor could. If some perverse
person, unwilling to lose the excitement of a contest, or to confess
himself beaten, by dint of expense and trouble accomplished what none
but an eccentric man would attempt, and none but a very fortunate man
could succeed in—namely, actual proof of illicit practices, before a
Committee of the House of Commons, ministers and public men in general
made an edifying display of virtuous indignation against the one case
which was proved, and decently ignored the six hundred and fifty-seven
which were not proved. All this was in the spirit of the former
system—was all right enough, if the end was to uphold that system, by
whatever means: it was among what Burke called “the shameful parts of
the constitution,”2 part of the filth out of which grew, and on which
was fed the stately umbrageous tree to which British society has often
been admiringly compared. But the fruit of that tree smacked of the
place it drew its Edition: current; Page: [768] nourishment from, and we
are minded at present not to cultivate any tree but one which will grow
in clean ground.

It is so obvious as to be hardly worth stating, that the reform is no
reform if the majority of the members are to be nominated, as they were
before, by a small number of powerful families. It is equally evident
that the majority will be so nominated if bribery can purchase or
intimidation command the votes, and neither be detected and punished.
The far greater part of the house are returned by bodies of electors the
great majority of whom are not beyond the influence either of corruption
or of coercion. Two hundred members at least are elected by
constituencies varying from two to four hundred persons—the very number
which, under the old system, produced Penryn, East Retford, and all the
most rotten of the rotten boroughs. In the counties the influence of the
squirearchy cannot be permanently resisted. Already we see the strides
which have been made towards recovering the ground which the oligarchy
had lost by the Reform Bill. Nothing but intense political excitement
can inspire the poorer electors with courage to resist the temptations
of sums of money invaluable in their circumstances, or to offend
landlords or customers who can cut off at a stroke half their income.
Shall there, then, be no other check to bribery and intimidation under
the new system than there was under the old? If so, as soon as the
remaining enthusiasm (in its very nature temporary) produced by the
existing events of the last four years shall have subsided, we shall be
landed exactly where we were before, except that political
demoralization will have spread farther, will have reached a much larger
and hitherto purer class than the wretched freemen and burgage tenants
of the old “glorious constitution.”

But this will not, must not be. Let any member of the new parliament,
who fears the reproach of innovation, ask himself the simple question
whether those who really wish to prevent a great evil will probably be
directed to the best mode of setting about it, by the precedents of
those who wished that the evil should not be prevented? And when he has
answered this question, let him ask himself another, viz., in what
manner a person, who really wished that the election of members of the
House of Commons should be free and pure, would attempt to secure that
object? What means would such a person adopt? Would he throw all kinds
of impediments in the way of proving illicit practices? or give it all
kinds of facilities? Would he leave it wholly to a particular individual
to bring the question to trial, according as he feels personally
interested in it or not, and is willing to spend an intolerable sum of
money upon it or not? Would he confide the functions of a court of
justice to a committee appointed for the nonce—a committee chosen by
lot, and the brains knocked out of it (actually the phrase in common
use!) by the power which the two parties have of striking off, without
any reason assigned, a proportion of the number? a committee
deliberating in secret, and whose decisions are notoriously governed in
almost all instances not by justice, but wholly by political
considerations?

Edition: current; Page: [769]
That the members of the house should be duly elected is the concern of
the house itself and of the nation; not of any individual, in the house
or out of it. There should be a special tribunal for deciding such
cases, and special officers for investigating them. All disputed
elections should be referred to one committee, selected at the
commencement of the session, composed of but few members, chosen for
their unquestionable fitness, and paid. There should be no fees to
officers of the house, no expenses but those which are absolutely
unavoidable, and even these should be repaid by the public to the
successful party. The investigations should be public, open to all the
world, and one proved instance of bribery by authorised agents should
vitiate the election.

At the opening of the last parliament, Mr. Charles Buller placed on the
order-book of the House of Commons a series of propositions which, if
adopted by the house, would have effected a salutary change in the forms
of proceeding in cases of disputed returns. The motion was never
discussed; we know not if it was even nominally brought on and entered
on the Journals.3 The first session of the reformed parliament was the
most suitable time for breaking through the mischievous rules and
practices of the unreformed house. But, unhappily, “no innovation,” or
as little of it as possible, was at that time the order of the day. The
Whigs made the mistake (which by this time they have had ample reason to
correct) of imagining that the danger to be apprehended was from the
friends of too rapid movement, not from the enemies of all movement
whatever. That opportunity, therefore, was lost; but it is never too
late to retrieve the error. We trust that Mr. Charles Buller, or some
other Reformer, will bring this subject to the serious consideration of
the house immediately after its meeting.


277.: THE LONDON REVIEW ON MUNICIPAL CORPORATION REFORM
 GLOBE AND TRAVELLER, 17 APR., 1835, PP. 2-3

While there can be no question about Mill’s interest in municipal
reform, the occasional cause of this account (see the opening sentence)
is surely the publication of the first number of the London Review, of
which he was the editor and Sir William Molesworth (1810-55), a wealthy
Radical politician, M.P. 1832-41 and 1845-55, the proprietor. In 1836
Molesworth was to buy the Westminster Review for £1000 and unite the two
under Mill’s editorship as the London and Westminster Review. Though
Mill (himself here anonymous, of course) promoted a policy of
semi-identification of authors in the London Review, he here speaks of
the “reputed author” of “Municipal Corporation Reform,” London Review, I
(Apr. 1835), 48-76, which is signed “J.A.R.,” not a very thick disguise
for John Arthur Roebuck, then M.P. for Bath. The article, headed
“Corporations—London Review,” is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A
notice of the Article on Municipal Edition: current; Page: [770]
Corporation Reform in No. 1 of the London Review: in the Globe of 17th
April 1835”

(MacMinn, p. 44).

among various interesting and well-timed articles in the first number of
the London Review, just published, is one on the great practical
question of the day—municipal corporation reform—to which we invite the
attention of all our readers. Without entering into the minutiae of
corporation abuses—which, if not already sufficiently known to every
one, are amply exhibited in the commissioners’ report1—the article
addresses itself at once to the practical question, how to frame the
required measure of reform. The writer has brought to the examination of
this question the best lights of the political philosophy of the age,
along with a just estimate of the modifications required by existing
opinions and impediments. And we venture to affirm that if either the
proprietor of the Review, or the reputed author of the article, will
promulgate its doctrines from their places in parliament in the
approaching debates on corporation reform, they will contribute not a
little to the satisfactory settlement of that vital question, and lay
the basis of no ordinary political reputation for themselves.

After briefly stating the uses and conveniences of a local or municipal
government, the writer says—

It is unnecessary here to dwell upon the history of our own
corporations, or those of Europe generally. Whatever were the
circumstances which gave rise to the municipia of ancient, or the
corporations of more modern times, the convenience of local governments,
as above explained, alone justifies, in the present condition of this
country, the existence of these petty jurisdictions. Their olden form
will doubtless influence the changes which may hereafter be made; but
this influence will, for the most part, be mischievous. Antiquated
rules, and foolish customs sanctioned by time, though opposed by reason,
will often prove stumbling blocks to the reformer of municipal
corporations, if he attempt to remodel the many various systems of
corporate government which now exist in England. One uniform system
ought to be established, framed with reference to the present condition
of the people; and to do this, the whole mass of ancient rubbish should
be completely swept away.

[Pp. 48-9.]

He proceeds to show that if utility alone were consulted, these local
governments would not be confined to the precincts of single towns, but
would be extended to districts, spreading over the whole country, by
which the whole of the present ill-contrived and ill-administered
apparatus of local judicature and local taxation would be superseded.
This, however, being a greater innovation than public opinion would at
present sanction, the writer contents himself with recommending that if
the corporation government cannot be extended beyond the town in which
it is situate, it shall at least include the whole town, which at
present is rarely the case.

The reviewer next proceeds to inquire what should be the powers of the
local Edition: current; Page: [771] government, and in what manner the
persons exercising these powers should be nominated.

The powers are partly powers of judicature, partly of administration,
partly of local legislation. The points for which the reviewer contends
are chiefly the three following:—

1st. That the administration of justice should be entirely separated
from the powers of administration and legislation, and confided not to
ignorant amateur aldermen, but in every town to one duly educated judge
(or more than one if required).

2d. That this judge should have power to adjudicate in all causes, civil
and criminal, subject to appeal to a central court in the metropolis.

3d. That the powers of local taxation, local legislation, police and
other branches of administration, should be vested in or placed under
the control of a town-council, periodically elected by all rate-payers,
or at the lowest by all ten pound householders; and that this
town-council should appoint the local judge.

For the fuller statement of these views, and for the argument by which
they are supported, we must refer our readers to the article itself. We
content ourselves with extracting a few, not of the most striking
passages, but of those which will best admit of being separated from the
context.

On the vices of the administration of justice in corporations as at
present constituted:

The recorder now is, in many places, a mere nominal officer; in others
he really does adjudicate the matters within his jurisdiction; but this
is done only a few times in the year. He is usually in these cases a
barrister, practising in London, and running down for a few days to the
seat of his jurisdiction; his business is dispatched with hurry, so that
he may run back again, and lose no chance of profit in his profession.
This ought to be wholly reformed. The recorder should, in all cases, be
made a permanent judge—residing in the town, administering justice from
day to day, and pursuing no other avocation whatever. He should be, what
judges are not now (excepting those of the Courts of Westminster), a
person possessing the confidence and respect of the people. At the
present time the greater part of the business of administering the law
is performed by persons whom the mass of the people bitterly hate, and
oftentimes contemn. All corporation magistrates, as now chosen, acquire,
from the mere fact of their being of the corporation, the ill-will, and
even the suspicion, of the persons within their jurisdiction. The body
of persons by whom such judges are chosen are looked upon by the people
as men living by dishonest peculation. Whether this suspicion be correct
or not, matters nothing. It is the necessary consequence of the system
of monopoly and secrecy which belongs to all our present corporations. A
judge, administering justice with this odium attached to him, cannot so
administer the law as to make the people yield a cheerful obedience to
it; no matter how just his judgments, the losing parties, having no
confidence in the judge, will never be content with his decision.
Instead of accommodating their minds to acquiescence, a surly spirit of
rebellious opposition arises within them. They do not, as they would do
had the judge their confidence, doubt their own opinion, and yield up
their passions and their opposition. Where the judge is respected, the
opinion of the world also leads men powerfully to this obedience;—when a
man sees that his neighbours all believe that he has had justice done,
he begins involuntarily to believe it himself; finding no sympathy in
his Edition: current; Page: [772] gall and bitterness, he is quiely
compelled to put up with his condition. How different is the situation
of a man condemned by a judge whom all suspect, and none love! At every
turn the disappointed suitor finds countenance, and sympathising
auditors; he charges his judge with unfairness, and they agree with him.
Suspicion and hate grow together. The administerer of the law is first
hated—then the law; and bitter are the feelings of animosity created in
the minds of the multitude by the belief that for them justice is but a
name, and law but a cruel step-mother.

[Pp. 54-5.]

On the mode in which English statesmen are accustomed to legislate, the
mode recommended by “practical men” and by the haters of “philosophy”
and “theory:”

Much care and knowledge would be required to make an accurate and
scientific classification of the rights to be conferred, and the
obligations imposed on the municipal governments; so that a general rule
might be framed, and put into the form of a law. To draw correctly and
distinctly the line between these various small jurisdictions and the
general government, would demand no ordinary proficiency in the science
of legislation; that is, so to draw it, that a complete conception of
the whole field of their jurisdiction could be attained by an instructed
man on a perusal of the law. It would be easy to perform the task in the
ordinary, clumsy mode of English legislation, in which difficulties are
avoided only by putting them off to be settled by expensive and doubtful
judicial decisions. Any English act of parliament which shall regulate
the extent of corporation jurisdictions will, doubtless, contain a
confused, illogical, and incomplete list of the powers conferred; an
attempt at an enumeration will be made, and appended to it will be a
drag net to catch any forgotten or stray right which may have escaped
the detail, in a shape, perhaps, like the following: “And all other
rights, powers, privileges, or immunities necessary to the due and
proper discharge of the several functions above enumerated.” What
“rights, powers, privileges, &c.” may be so necessary, will lie hidden
in the womb of time till a judgment of a court of law shall give them
birth, so that we shall never come to the end of the list. The decisions
of the courts will never do more than settle the matter immediately in
dispute, and, on every fresh emergency, a new suit, and new decision,
will be requisite. To avoid these mischiefs by a previous, complete, and
exhaustive classification of the rights and obligations necessary to the
end in view, will, we fear, never suggest itself to those whose business
it will be to prepare a bill for the consideration of the legislature.
To do so would appear too much like the conduct of a philosopher; and a
philosopher, as every blockhead is supposed to know and always asserts,
is not a practical man. The practical men are the drag-net framers—men
to whom nothing suggests itself but what a narrow experience teaches—men
who never use thought to learn what may happen, but who are content to
task their own memory to remember what has happened. They put down a
confused list of particulars in the order in which their memory supplies
them, and then complacently crown their work by the capital contrivance
of a wide generality, which, as it distinctly specifies nothing, may,
upon occasion, be made to signify anything. After this manner have all
our laws hitherto been fashioned. Would that we could reasonably hope
that, in the case of corporation reform, science was about to assume its
proper function, and order and logic to occupy the place of a confused
and disorderly enumeration!

[Pp. 58-9.]

In the following passage the defects of the bill formerly proposed by
Lord Brougham, for giving corporations to the new boroughs,2 are
forcibly exposed. Edition: current; Page: [773] Lord Brougham, we are
sure, has long been completely alive to the faults of that hastily
concocted measure:

We are not inclined, in any case, to be very solicitous about names
merely, but instances do occur in which the effects of a name are of
great import. The matter in hand appears one of these. Instead,
therefore, of retaining the old, and in themselves unmeaning
designations of corporate officers, it would be wise to choose new and
significant ones. The designation to which this remark chiefly applies
is—aldermen. We propose to do away entirely with the name alderman, and
for this reason; aldermen in almost all instances have hitherto been
chosen for life. As in the army, once a colonel always a colonel, so in
corporations, once an alderman always an alderman. It is deemed not so
much an office as a dignity, and to deprive a man of a dignity once
attained is contrary to usage and feeling. The idea of permanency is so
indissolubly connected with the name, that we see little chance of
getting rid of the one without the other. The name, if it now point to
any, points to one only, and that an insignificant one, of the many
circumstances which should determine the choice of the elector.
Alderman, or elder, is one whom, from being old, people believe to be
experienced. Now age is but a faulty index to experience—and experience
alone is not enough to constitute a good servant of the public. Honesty
is an essential quality, and this, unfortunately, has no necessary
connexion with experience.

Having got rid of the insignificant name alderman, one difficulty will
be removed from our way, when endeavouring to apportion to each officer
the business he will have to perform. To each will be affixed a
significant name—a name that will distinctly point to, and, in some
measure, mark out the duties of his office; while with these
appellations no mischievous associations of permanency or dignity will
be allied. There is more importance in this matter than inexperienced
observers would, at first sight, be inclined to attach to it.

Amongst other offices which we propose to abolish is that of mayor. The
aggregate of duties now attached to that office are heterogeneous, and
ought in no case to be exercised by one and the same individual. While,
on the other hand, there is no need of creating anew any head to the
body corporate. Under the proposed system the mayor would not act as
judge or magistrate, for these duties would be performed by the regular
judge; he would have no administrative office, for all that class of
duties would be specifically apportioned to their respective officers.
All the members of the town-council to be hereafter spoken of would be
equal, and elect their own chairman. To retain a mayor under these
circumstances would be to retain a useless incumbrance.

[Pp. 70-1.]

The following passage well deserves the attention of Repealers and
anti-Repealers, as the reviewer points out the only rational
“adjustment” of the repeal question would be to give Ireland a local
legislature for local purposes exclusively, and to give to all other
parts of the empire the same advantages:

Much has been said—much more will be said, and perhaps something
eventually done—respecting the union of Ireland and England. The
remedy—the only effectual one for the evils of which the Irish people
justly complain, lies in the due application of the corporation system.
They complain that their interests are judged of and controlled by
persons at a distance, and ignorant of their affairs. In order to remedy
this mischief, it has been proposed to do away with the supreme
authority of the imperial legislature. This would certainly avoid the
evil complained of, but might entail upon both countries others of still
greater magnitude. When there is no higher authority to settle
differences between Edition: current; Page: [774] contending
governments, war is the arbiter; and between nations so nearly allied as
England and Ireland, it behoves us to find, if possible, some means of
avoiding so direful a calamity as war. The remedy is at hand, and easy
of application. The evil complained of is, that the concerns of the
Irish people are administered by persons at a distance, and ignorant
respecting them: to obviate this, grant to the people corporation
governments. Bring, by this means, the government of their concerns home
to their very doors; give large and liberal powers to these subordinate
governments, but keep them still subject to the general legislature, and
let their limits, under the law, be determined by the judicature. Thus
on the one hand we obviate the existing ills, and avoid those that are
dreaded in consequence of a separation.

278.: SENIOR’S PREFACE TO THE FOREIGN COMMUNICATIONS IN THE POOR LAW REPORT
 GLOBE AND TRAVELLER, 22 JUNE, 1835, P. 2

This article is in response to the separate publication of Senior’s
Preface to App. F of the “Report from His Majesty’s Commissioners for
Inquiring into the Administration and Practical Operation of the Poor
Laws” (see No. 239), under the title, Statement of the Provision for the
Poor, and of the Condition of the Labouring Classes, in a Considerable
Portion of America and Europe: Being the Preface to the Foreign
Communications Contained in the Appendix to the Poor Law Report (London:
Fellowes, 1835). The unheaded leader is described in Mill’s bibliography
as “A leading article, in the Globe of 22d June 1835, on Senior’s
Preface to the Foreign Communications (Poor Law Report)”

(MacMinn, p. 44).

the value of the recent poor law inquiry has not been confined to the
important changes which it has been the means of effecting in our pauper
legislation. In itself, and considered merely as an investigation of
facts, it is eminently useful. It has afforded almost the first
authentic and accurate information ever yet possessed on a subject which
has so long been a theme of acrimonious controversy, and which must
always be of the deepest interest—the condition of our labouring
population. To the facts which the inquiry has elicited on this subject
public attention has been forcibly drawn by the subsequent legislative
proceedings; but it is not yet so generally known that the evidence
taken by the commission affords an equally interesting collection of
information on the pauper management and condition of the poor
throughout the greater part of the civilized world.

In the year 1833, Lord Palmerston, at the suggestion of the poor law
commissioners, issued to all his Majesty’s diplomatic agents in foreign
countries a very full and carefully framed set of queries, calculated to
elicit complete and clear information on the nature and practical
operation of the legal provisions existing in those countries severally
for the relief of the poor.1 The answers to Edition: current; Page:
[775] these inquiries, together with some valuable communications made
by private individuals to the commissioners, have been printed as one of
the appendices to the poor law report, and form a large volume. Mr.
Senior, to whom his country and mankind are already so largely indebted
for his wise and zealous exertions on this subject,2 has, in a preface
to the volume in question, exhibited an abridged view of the most
important part of its contents; and we are much pleased to see that this
preface has been published as a separate volume (of 238 pages), to which
we earnestly invite the attention of all who feel interested in a
subject, one of the most interesting which ever occupied the thoughts of
a statesman or a philosopher.

From the evidence presented by Mr. Senior it appears that the principle
of the English poor laws, that of the legal right of every human being
to relief, is recognized by nearly half the nations of Europe; and that
wherever it exists, the abuses also which have been supposed to be
peculiar to England have crept in, but generally to a very moderate
extent; and nowhere, except perhaps in the canton of Berne, in
Switzerland [pp. 74-84], has the laxity of poor law administration, and
the consequent degradation of the labouring classes, reached a height at
all comparable to what was nearly universal in this country before the
late poor law act. In the very able statement which the government of
Berne did not think it troublesome or beneath their dignity to frame and
communicate to his Majesty’s Consul, Mr. Morier,* the reader will see a
picture of evils very closely resembling those we see here, and, what is
more remarkable, a government which understands and is capable of
explaining their nature and origin.3 In Berne, accordingly, and in
general wherever the abuses have reached a formidable height, measures
are in contemplation for repressing them; and chiefly by the very means
which have been recently adopted in this country—the establishment of a
central control; for the countries where no such control exists are
uniformly those in which the abuses are greatest.

For the most part, however, the principle of compulsory relief has not
produced in foreign countries evils at all comparable to those which
have been engrafted on it here; and Mr. Senior is even of opinion that
“in the majority of the nations which have adopted it, the existing
system appears to work well.” [P. 84.] He then points out with
remarkable good sense and discrimination the circumstances which in
those countries have operated as checks to abuse. After mentioning, 1st.
that in some of the countries in question the labouring classes are
still serfs (which entirely alters the state of the question in regard
to them); and 2ndly, that in most of the others the compulsory system is
still in its infancy Edition: current; Page: [776] [pp. 84-5], Mr.
Senior proceeds to give further highly important details of the points
of difference which exist in the state of the labouring population in
this and other countries [pp. 85-94], which we extract elsewhere at some
length, under the head of “Contemporary Press.”4 We have preferred to
give these valuable particulars in Mr. Senior’s words rather than in our
own.

In that part of the volume which relates to the countries which
recognise no legal claim to relief (in most of which, however, there is
extensive pauperism, and an organised system of public charity) the
reader will find much interesting information. We would direct his
attention particularly to the account of the much-vaunted “Home
Colonization” system of Belgium and Holland, which, from the facts here
stated, plainly appears to be, what from general principles one might
have predicted that it would be, a miserable failure.5


279.: FIRST REPORT OF THE POOR LAW COMMISSIONERS
 GLOBE AND TRAVELLER, 8 SEPT., 1835, P. 4

This unheaded leader, a comment on “First Annual Report of the Poor Law
Commissioners for England and Wales,” PP, 1835, XXXV, 107-359, is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “A notice of the First Report of the
Commissioners under the Poor Laws Amendment Act, printed as a leading
article in the Globe of 8th September 1835”

(MacMinn, p. 45).

the first annual report of the Commissioners1 for carrying into effect
the Poor Laws Amendment Act has just been laid before parliament, and we
are glad to learn that Lord John Russell has directed that, like the
report of the Commissioners of Poor Law Inquiry,2 it shall be printed in
an octavo form and rendered accessible to the public at large.

So great a reform in the details of the administration of so important
and complicated a branch of the institutions of a great country—a
reform, too, which, both before and since its passing, has stirred up
such a mass of prejudiced or interested hostility—was likely, in the
commencement, to be attended with many difficulties. The difficulties,
however, appear in this, as in many other cases, to have vanished as
soon as they were steadfastly looked at and boldly Edition: current;
Page: [777] encountered. It is truckling, it is a timid and wavering
policy, which creates difficulties. Those who court opposition, by
showing that they fear it, always meet with plenty of it. The authors of
the Poor Law Bill were masters of their subject, and therefore knew that
they were right; and knowing the right they dared do it, and relied upon
the good sense of the nation for bearing them through. Nor were they
disappointed. The Commissioners for executing the act have followed in
the steps of its framers, and have carried the provisions of the act
into effect through a great portion of the most pauperised parts of
England, with a facility which scarcely any of the supporters of the
bill expected, and already with a good effect which gives the most
complete confirmation to all their predictions.

Before we extract for the benefit of our readers any part of the
information contained in the report, we must remark how admirable a
precedent has been introduced into our legislation by that provision of
the act to which this report owes its origin;3 and how much it were to
be desired that not only a Board merely created for a special purpose,
like the Poor Law Board, but that all public offices, new or old, should
be required to lay before parliament annual reports of their proceedings
during the year, with full statements, such as the present report
contains, of the reasons of any of those proceedings the grounds of
which are not obvious. Such a regulation would not only afford
encouragement and reward to a good administration of the several
departments, while it imposed a salutary restraint upon bad, but it
would be a check upon the Ministers of the Crown in the distribution of
patronage; it would compel them to place able and efficient men at the
heads of departments, because ignorance, incapacity, or negligence, not
to mention worse faults, would be at once detected by the necessity of
an annual statement and vindication of all the proceedings of the
department, and by the discussions to which those statements would give
rise.

The Commissioners have, during the first year of their administration—

1. Corrected numerous misunderstandings of the intention of the act, and
diffused through the whole country a better knowledge of its purposes
and provisions.

2. Occasioned a very general substitution, by the parishes themselves,
of relief in kind for relief in money; the effect of which has been a
very considerable reduction of the amount of out-door pauperism. It is
remarkable that in the only cases in which any local disturbances have
been produced by the operations of the Commissioners, the provocation
has consisted not in the refusal of relief, the introduction of the
workhouse system, &c., but in the substitution of bread for money; thus
showing clearly the real origin of the dissatisfaction.

3. They have effected unions of parishes throughout a large part of the
most pauperised counties, placing each union under a representative
body, or Board of Edition: current; Page: [778] Guardians, elected by
the rate payers. The consequences of this change have already been most
salutary. It is not only the sole means by which the grand remedy of
poor law evils, the introduction of the workhouse system, can be
effected, but it is also the only system by which local jobbing and
peculation can be arrested, and an agency, as well superior as
subordinate, obtained of adequate respectability and skill.

4. They have facilitated (what under the old law of settlement4 was
virtually impossible) the migration of labourers and their families from
the parishes where they were superabundant, to the manufacturing towns
where there was a pressing demand for new hands.

5. They have formed rules to be observed by the Boards of Guardians in
conducting their business, and for the management of workhouses.

The number of parishes which have already been formed into unions are
2,066, constituting 110 unions; their population forms one-tenth of the
population of England and Wales; their rates one sixth of the amount for
the whole kingdom. In the unions which have been formed for a sufficient
length of time to allow of a comparison, a very great reduction of rates
has already been effected. A statement furnished in p. 26 of the report
shows a reduction of 4,384l. on a total of 13,889l., or about 30 per
cent. The effect on the labourers themselves has been admirable.
Wherever the allowances in aid of wages have been discontinued, wages
have risen, and the whole of the able-bodied paupers have found
employment, generally within the parish. We shall find room to-morrow
for such extracts from the report itself as may best illustrate and
confirm our foregoing observations.5

The Commissioners have expounded the principles upon which they act,
with a degree of clearness and precision which will give confidence to
the late Commissioners of Inquiry,6 and supporters of the act, that the
measure will not be injured in the execution by acting upon partial
views, or without that knowledge of sound principles, and confidence in
their operation, which is essential to the success of such an
undertaking. The determination announced of applying general rules to
the un-united parishes, and of enforcing one uniform system of accounts,
is a subject of especial congratulation. If the Commissioners complete
their task with the same attention to general principles, with the same
firm yet cautious perseverance which they appear to have exercised at
the commencement of their duties, the country will owe them a debt of
gratitude second only to that which is due by the country to the late
Commissioners of Inquiry by whom the measures were prepared.

280.: THE HOUSE OF LORDS [1]
 GLOBE AND TRAVELLER, 9 OCT., 1835, P. 3

Leaders on the House of Lords had appeared on p. 2 of the Globe and
Traveller on 29 and 30 Sept., and 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8 Oct., 1835. The
British Upper House attracted Mill’s attention as well as the public’s
at this time; see his letter to Tocqueville in September (EL, CW, Vol.
XII, p. 272), his “Postscript: The Close of the Session” (CW, Vol. VI,
pp. 312-17), and, continuing his argument, No. 281. This letter is
headed as title, with the subhead: “To the Editor of the Globe.” It is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “A letter signed A. on the Reform of
the House of Lords, in the Globe of 9th October 1835”

(MacMinn, p. 45).

sir,—

I am about to address you on a subject which is at this moment engaging
the attention of the whole nation, which will never again cease to
engross all minds until it shall be set at rest, and which has been
treated by none of the organs and directors of public opinion with so
much judgment and wisdom as by your journal. I need not say that I mean
the Reform of the House of Lords. And I could not help beginning by
expressing the admiration which I feel for the spirit in which you have
discussed this question, because I am about seriously to controvert some
of the opinions which you have recently put forth in regard to it.

You have very wisely deemed it to be no longer a question whether any
reform is needful in the Tories’ house, nor whether that reform should
amount to a thorough change in its constitution. These are now evident.
We are free to constitute our second chamber in the best manner; and we
have only to inquire what the best manner is—conformity to received
ideas and feelings being of course one of the elements of which the
excellence of this, as of any other political institution, is composed,
but by no means the sole, or even the principal element.

Various plans have been proposed for so improving the composition of the
Upper House that it shall no longer make a practice of thwarting all the
popular measures of the Lower.

The first is, a large creation of Peers. But this seems to be at length
generally given up. It would swell the house to a bulk altogether
unsuitable for deliberation; and as the new members would, from the very
moment of their elevation, be placed in exactly the same misleading
position as their predecessors, the remedy would have to be repeated at
every new advance of the public mind, and would therefore be altogether
nugatory.

All other plans seem to resolve themselves into one or other of these
two:—To make the House of Lords a senate for life, named by the King; or
to make it a representative body. You, Sir, have suggested, as
preferable to either, a scheme which (pardon the expression) appears to
offer an infelicitous combination of both.

You propose that the Upper House should consist of 200 members—one
Edition: current; Page: [780] hundred to be named for life by the King,
the other hundred to be elected for a term of years by the Peers
themselves, as the representative Peers of Scotland and Ireland are now
chosen by the collective peerage of those ancient kingdoms.1

You have proposed arrangements which would prevent the Tory majority of
the Peerage from engrossing the whole of the representative portion of
your proposed Upper Chamber.2 The Whig minority would obtain a certain
number of representatives, but of course nothing like a majority.

On the first introduction of your plan it would, no doubt, if the Whigs
remain in office, effect the desired change in the politics of the body.
The Tories would indeed have a large majority of the hundred
representative Peers; but a still larger majority, or the whole of the
Peers for life, named by a Whig ministry, would of course be Whigs.

Suppose, however, either of two things: It is generally believed that
the Tories, now and at all times, are only prevented from making a fresh
trial of the people’s patience by their own conviction that the
opportunity would be of no service to them. But suppose that immediately
after the passing of the House of Lords’ amendment act, the Tories
should be brought into power for the sole purpose of selecting the 100
Peers for life out of their own body. The Tories would then become even
more predominant in the House of Lords than at present. They would
nominate the whole of the life Peers, and a large majority of the
representative ones.

Or, dropping this hypothesis, let us suppose that no such unfortunate
occurrence of circumstances takes place, and that the Whig ministry
obtain the nomination of the whole 100 Peers for life. What kind of
persons will they be likely to nominate?

I maintain that they will nominate almost exclusively the most
aristocratic and least popular among the considerable members of the
Whig party. In the first place, the nomination of such persons is most
conformable to the received idea of a Second Chamber, which, it is
always understood, ought to be of a more Conservative character than the
Lower House, whose supposed democratic and innovating tendencies it is
intended to restrain. In the next place, it is a supposition probable in
itself, and borne out by experience in a neighbouring country, that a
ministry will usually nominate to the Upper Chamber those among their
adherents who have least chance of being elected to the Lower. Those who
can find seats in the House of Commons are for the most part likely to
be of more use to their party there than elsewhere; especially if they
be men of popular talents. In France, a peerage is the ordinary
consolation tendered to a ministerial deputy who has lost his seat and
sees no probability of getting another.

Edition: current; Page: [781]
I am, therefore, entitled to assume that the Peers for life would
chiefly consist of that portion of the Whig party who have most in
common with the Tories—who on questions on which their party is divided,
such as the corn laws, the taxes on knowledge, the ballot, triennial
parliaments, and many others, would be most likely to take the unpopular
side; and who, on any schism which, on these or other questions, might
take place in the Whig party, would be most likely to join the Tories.
If the reform of the House of Lords on a plan similar to yours had taken
place two years ago, the men most likely to have been selected would in
great part have belonged to the class of public men who have since been
called the Waverers.

For these reasons, it appears to me inevitable that a time would soon
come when a large majority of the Peers for life, by whatever ministry
nominated, would be again in open opposition to the spirit of the Lower
House. Another modification, therefore, in the House of Lords would be
necessary; and your plan does not provide any means by which an adequate
one could be made.

On your plan the number of Peers to be named by the Crown is limited to
a hundred. This list would of course be filled up immediately. No means,
therefore, would exist of modifying the spirit of this part of the body,
except by the slow process of supplying the vacancies caused by death or
resignation. The Crown and the House of Commons could only break a
hostile majority by operating upon the other half of the body, the
representative portion.

Now, of this portion, while the peerage is Tory, a very large majority
would consist of Tories. The only means, therefore, of restoring harmony
between the two branches of the legislature would be to create new Peers
equal in number to almost the entire British Peerage augmented by that
of Scotland and Ireland.

It is true, that to so extensive a creation the objection would no
longer exist of its rendering the Upper House too numerous for
deliberation. The creation of Peers would then be a creation of electors
only, not of representatives. But though free from this objection, would
not so great an addition to the body, liable also to be continually
repeated, so lower the value and importance of the peerage, that no
minister, with the feelings and opinions of nearly all the present
generation of public men, would choose to have recourse to it?

And besides, this remedy, even if resorted to, might not accomplish the
desired object. On your plan the minority of the peerage would have the
power of returning some portion of the representative Peers; indeed, if
not, the show of representation would be a mockery; the representatives
would either represent the present Tory body exclusively, or the Crown
exclusively. Let us say, then, that even after so large a creation of
Whig Peers, the Tory body, who now predominate in the peerage, would
still be represented by a portion, say one-third of the representative
peerage; all, therefore, which ministers would have accomplished by even
so great a change in the composition of the collective British peerage
would be to get two-thirds of the 100 representative Peers on Edition:
current; Page: [782] their side. Now, if it should happen, which it very
well might, that from any of the causes to which I have already alluded,
more than two-thirds of the Peers for life, who compose the other 100,
should turn against them, they would not, even by such a strong measure
as that which I have supposed, have obtained a majority of the whole
body.

For these and other reasons, I conceive that the plan which you propose
for the re-organization of the Upper House could not be permanent, and
would only prove the commencement of a series of successive
modifications, which would end in leaving us without any Upper Chamber
at all. As it is the second blow which makes the quarrel, so it is the
second change which destroys confidence in the permanency of what is
established, and creates general instability. It is therefore of the
greatest importance that when we once touch an institution we should
mend it thoroughly, so that it shall not require to be touched again.

In a future communication I will, with your permission, state the
reasons I have to urge in favour of the plan which, of all yet proposed
for the reform of the House of Lords, appears to me the most likely to
be capable of being permanently adhered to.

I have the honour to be, Sir, yours respectfully,

A.


281.: THE HOUSE OF LORDS [2]
 GLOBE AND TRAVELLER, 16 OCT., 1835, P. 2

For the context and the heading, see No. 280. the letter is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A second letter signed A. on the Reform of the
House of Lords, in the Globe of 16th Oct. 1835”

(MacMinn, p. 46).

sir,—

In a former communication I have attempted to explain the objections to
which it occurred to me that the particular scheme which you had
suggested for the reform of the House of Lords was justly liable. I will
now propound that which seems to me at once the most effectual, and the
least exceptionable which could be suggested, for effecting such a
change in the composition of that house as shall render it at once
efficient for the ends which are commonly regarded as requiring the
existence of a Second Chamber, and unlikely to set itself in opposition
to what is good in the acts and purposes of the First.

I must begin by observing, that in proposing a scheme for present
adoption I regard myself as precluded from recommending any which should
interfere with existing names, or radically alter the associations at
present connected with those names; the House of Lords, reformed, must
still be a House of Lords—not another House of Commons; its members must
be drawn from the Peerage only, and the Peerage must, as heretofore, be
recruited solely by the crown. I say this Edition: current; Page: [783]
not from any superstitious reverence for ancient usages, nor from a
belief that an Upper Chamber composed of a titled and privileged class
is in itself the best which could be constituted. I say it because, in a
government which is to be (as it is necessary that all governments
should now be) essentially popular—and in which, therefore, even the
barriers which we erect to restrain the unenlightened or incautious
exercise of the people’s will must be such barriers as the people
themselves will voluntarily forbear to overstep—in such a state of
things we cannot afford to lose any hold over the people’s minds which
existing names, historical recollections, traditional attachment,
custom, and imagination already give to the institutions which are
designed to serve that purpose. Give us a good Upper House, and if you
can call it a House of Lords the people will tolerate in that house a
greater degree of independence in the exercise of its constitutional
authority, than they will bear from a body created but of yesterday,
with a new name and composed in a completely new manner. Now, no one
will doubt that it is desirable that the Upper House, being just so
constituted as to have no interest in abusing its powers, should then be
allowed as much latitude for the conscientious exercise of them as the
people can be induced to permit. It should therefore remain a House of
Lords.

But although the question for our consideration is not what would be the
best Upper House if we were making a new constitution for a new people,
but how we can best remodel the present House of Lords without taking
away its character as such—yet, in considering this we ought to have
before us an idea of the kind of Upper Chamber which is best in the
abstract, in order that we may render the House of Lords as similar to
that ideal Upper House as is consistent with the limits within which we
must confine our innovations.

The object of an Upper House, when the Lower House is chosen by the
people, is to ensure a revision of the enactments passed by the Lower.
Now a revision is of no use, if made by a body no wiser than that whose
acts it is to revise. The Upper Chamber, therefore, must not be elected
by the same constituency as the House of Commons, otherwise it would be
merely another, and probably a worse, House of Commons; and, at the
best, every able man whom the people might elect to it would be an able
man subtracted from the Lower House.

On the other hand, the revising body must not be so chosen, nor hold
their office on such a tenure, that they shall have no motive to consult
the public good; much less should they, like the present House of Lords,
have the strongest motive to the pursuit of ends irreconcilable with the
public good. They must not constitute a caste—they must not hold their
power from themselves only, without the possibility of discharging them
from their office if they misconduct themselves. There must be security,
and effectual security, for their doing their duty. That security the
public mind is now too much enlightened by experience, to expect from
any other principle than responsibility; in other words, Edition:
current; Page: [784] removability. The members of the Upper House must
be chosen, and the choice must be revocable—not indeed by the people,
the objections to that I have already stated, but by some party
identified in interest with the people; some party, therefore,
responsible to the people, and deriving its origin from popular choice.

No such body can be thought of for this purpose, except the House of
Commons.

I conceive that the best Upper House would be an Upper House chosen by
the Lower; with the necessary proviso that they should not choose any of
their own members.

An Upper House so chosen would be completely identified in interest with
the Lower House, and with the people. They could pursue the same ends,
and act on the same general principles. But they would be a wiser, a
more instructed and discreet body. It may very reasonably be assumed
that a select body, like the House of Commons, would be more careful and
more enlightened judges of the merits of philosophers and statesmen than
a numerous constituency, provided they really desired to choose the
fittest men. And that they would desire this cannot be doubted, when we
consider not only that they would be responsible to the people for the
conduct of those whom they chose, but that they would be choosing
persons to whom to entrust a veto on their own acts. This would ensure
their making choice of men who they believed would aim at the same ends
with themselves, and whom they believed the most fitted in point of
talents and acquirements to pursue these ends skilfully. Men do not
voluntarily bestow the power of controlling their own measures upon any
but upon persons in whose intentions and in whose judgment they have
full confidence.

One great recommendation of this measure is, that, alone among all plans
that I have ever known proposed for the constitution of a popular
government, it would ensure to the people (under efficient securities
for good conduct) the services of those able and instructed men who are
not known to the people, in addition to those who are so. The men of
active habits and popular talents, or of personal influence in the
constituencies, who would in general be elected to serve in the House of
Commons, would look out for a different class of persons to serve in the
Upper House: they would look out for men who had qualified themselves,
by hard study and superior mental cultivation, to put the wishes or
resolves of the people, or of the people’s direct representatives, into
a practicable shape; to chuse their legislative expedients, and to draw
up their enactments in a circumspect and cautious manner, so as to avoid
those collateral inconveniences, not sufficiently considered in the
pursuit of the main object, which are apt to arise from the
legislatorial attempts of purely popular assemblies. A nation which
should adopt such a constitution for its Upper Chamber would do much to
free itself from the greatest inconvenience of representative
governments—crude and unskilled legislation.

Edition: current; Page: [785]
If you, Sir, or any of your correspondents, can suggest any plan which
would so completely attain the ends of an Upper House, and at the same
time afford any thing like the same security against the errors to which
a badly constituted Upper House is liable, I shall be happy to
re-consider my opinion, and to discuss the matter further in your
columns.1

In the meantime I have one inference still to draw. If, as I think, an
Upper House chosen by the Lower, with a restriction against choosing any
of themselves, be the best Upper House conceivable, it follows that when
our Upper House must be constituted within the conditions of a House of
Lords, the best House of Lords conceivable would be a House of Lords
selected (at the beginning of every parliament) from the entire Peerage
by the House of Commons. It might be advisable as a part of this scheme
that either branch of the legislature should have the power of
addressing the King to create any particular person a Peer; but whether
this would be essential admits of doubt, as the King’s minister, who
would generally share the sentiments of the majority of both houses,
would have a strong interest in keeping the Peerage properly recruited
with eligible persons.

I throw out this plan, Sir (as you said of that which you yourself
suggested), for general consideration.2 I do not believe that any so
simple, so easy in its working, or so efficient for all its purposes,
can be found; but if it can, I trust some of your correspondents, or,
what would be still better, yourself, will suggest that better plan, or
point out the objections, unforeseen by me, to which it is possible that
my proposition may be liable.

282.: GRANT’S ARITHMETIC FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND EXERCISES FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE SENSES
 GLOBE AND TRAVELLER, 23 OCT., 1835, P. 3

This review, containing material important in understanding Mill’s views
of education, is of two books by Mill’s friend, walking companion, and
colleague in the Examiner’s Office of the East India Company, Horace
Grant (1800-59), who wrote a number of elementary textbooks of which
these were the first, issued by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful
Knowledge. The article, in the “Literary Examiner,” is headed
“Arithmetic for Young Children; being a series of exercises exemplifying
the manner in which Arithmetic should be taught to young children.
[London: Knight, 1835.] / Exercises for the Edition: current; Page:
[786] Improvement of the Senses, for Young Children. By the Author of
Arithmetic for Young Children. [London: Knight, 1835.]” It is described
in Mill’s bibliography as “A notice of Grant’s ‘Arithmetic for young
children’ and ‘Exercises on the Senses’ in the Globe of 23d October
1835”

(MacMinn, p. 46).

under the above titles the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge
have given to the world the first two works of a series which promises
to outweigh in utility all that the Society has yet produced. The
appearance of these works amounts to a reform in elementary education.

They are, in fact, the very first works which completely carry into
practice, from the earliest commencement of instruction, those
principles of teaching which the wisest writers on education have long
inculcated, but which have mostly remained barren theories, because no
one had submitted to the irksome drudgery of contriving in detail a
system of means for carrying the principles into effect.

It has, for instance, been long felt that there are two methods of what
is called instruction, which are as remote from each other as light from
darkness. One of these is the system of cram; the other is the system of
cultivating mental power. One proposes to stuff a child’s memory with
the results which have been got at by other people; the other aims at
qualifying its mind to get at results by its own observation,
experience, and reflection. One treats a child like a creature that has
nothing but a memory, and loads that memory with words, trusting to
Providence for enabling the child some time or other to put a meaning
into those words; the other considers the child as possessing
intelligence as well as memory, and believes it to be the main object of
instruction to strengthen that intelligence by judicious exercise. The
one (to give a sample of the whole) teaches a child the Latin language
by making him learn by rote rules of syntax written in the very language
which they are to help him to learn; the other does not even give rules
at all till the pupil is sufficiently acquainted with the language to be
able to understand them, but makes him learn the theory by seeing it at
work in his own practice, and instead of beginning with abstractions,
helps him to rise gradually to those abstractions through the means by
which they were first arrived at, namely, through an accurate knowledge
of the particular facts which they are generalizations of.

The ultimate point, the climax, of the method of cram, has been for the
first time reached in our age; it is called the system of Jacotot,1 and
surpasses all former specimens of the cram method in this, that former
cram-doctors crammed Edition: current; Page: [787] an unfortunate
child’s memory with abstract propositions in metaphysics, morals,
religion, &c., which could not possibly to them have any meaning; but
Jacotot, thinking it very improper to teach a child that certain
propositions are truths, without giving them the reasons that prove them
to be such, actually makes the unfortunate creature get by rote not only
the propositions, but the reasons too!

As Jacotot, by his caricature of the cram system, has brought nobly into
relief its intrinsic absurdity, so the author of the works before us
(Mr. Horace Grant) has shown still more strongly than any one else the
excellence of the system which considers a child as a being endowed with
reason—by the admirable specimen which he has afforded of the means of
bringing that reason into exercise from the earliest years.—In
arithmetic, for instance, hardly any child, and not many grown persons,
as at present taught, have any idea of numbers but as marks on a slate,
or of the rules of arithmetic but as a set of mechanical operations more
like tricks of legerdemain than anything else.

Mr. Grant has, in these works, so chosen the ideas to be presented to
the child’s mind, and has presented them in such an order, that the
child’s intellect is carried with him throughout; and at every step the
child acquires not only a set of sounds, but ideas, and with those ideas
the habit of really discovering truths for himself; of using his eyes,
his hands, all his perceptive faculties, and his first nascent powers of
judgment and reasoning. This is done, not with the absurd purpose of
preventing the child from acquiring abstract notions, or inclining him
to reject all general propositions of which he cannot be made to
understand the evidence. That many truths must be taken upon trust from
others is inevitable; but though the child must be told many things
which he cannot himself investigate, still those things which he can
investigate he should be taught to investigate: those things which are
level to his faculties—to all our faculties—he should be accustomed not
to get by rote without understanding, but to understand, and not merely
to understand, but whenever possible to find out for himself.

We cannot conclude without adding, that we have had the testimonies of
several intelligent mothers to the admirable adaptation of these works
to the intended purposes, and the delight, as well as permanent benefit,
which children derive from them.


283.: WAKEFIELD’S POPULAR POLITICS
 EXAMINER, 29 JAN., 1837, PP. 70-1

Mill’s return to the newspapers after an absence of more than a year
shows his continued interest in the views of Wakefield, especially at a
time when his hopes for Radical coherence and strength were high. This
review, in the “Literary Examiner,” is headed Edition: current; Page:
[788] “Popular Politics. By Edward Gibbon Wakefield, Esq. [London:]
Charles Knight. [1837.]” It is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A
notice of E.G. Wakefield’s ‘Popular Politics’ in the Examiner of 29th
January 1837”

(MacMinn, p. 48).

this is not a new book, but consists of “Extracts from various
publications, by the same author, all of which are out of print.”1 They
are mostly from his writings on the Punishment of Death,2 or from
England and America—a work which, though very extensively known to be
from his pen, Mr. Wakefield had not, so far as we are aware, hitherto
avowed.3

Mr. Wakefield is one of the most vigorous and effective writers of our
time. But we do not think that this little volume gives an adequate
notion of his merits. It is a book of fragments, and Mr. Wakefield,
whether as a thinker or a writer, shines less in parts than in the
whole. As a writer, his forte is general effect, while the means by
which he produces it will not always bear a critical inspection. His
thoughts, indeed, like all thoughts of value, might be exhibited,
successfully, for some purposes, in small compass: but such is not his
way of exhibiting them; he rather (and it is to this he owes the great
success of his works) places a principle before us, clothed in
properties and circumstances, than nakedly, and in the abstract he shows
us the principle actually at work, makes us see how many things it
explains, and even in how wide a sphere its influence is exerted. Though
his thoughts are large and comprehensive, it is by an accumulation of
details that he makes them tell. If those details are exhibited
partially, the effect is not produced.

The fundamental idea, for instance, of England and America, was, that
the peculiarity in the economical condition of most old countries is a
scarcity, not of labour in proportion to capital, nor of capital in
proportion to labour, but of land, in proportion both to the one and the
other.4 The mode in which he proved this was by a survey of all the
leading economical circumstances of English society, the condition of
every particular class, and especially the uneasinesses of every
particular class; and of these he gave a picture, which for graphic
power and coarse vigour of colouring, has hardly ever been exceeded.
Having brought these various phenomena thus vividly before the
imagination, he showed that the cause he had assigned, deficiency of
land in proportion to labour and capital, or excess of labour and
capital in proportion to land, was at the root of them all. His
conclusion was, that the resource is to remedy the disproportion; to
extend our soil, partly by rendering foreign soils virtually ours,
through the free admission of their produce, and partly by systematic
colonization of the immense Edition: current; Page: [789] uncultivated
tracts of our ultramarine possessions, on the only rational plan
possible—the plan which Mr. Wakefield invented, and which Parliament has
adopted as the basis of the new colony of South Australia.5

All this is done, and done most powerfully in the book: but
comparatively little of the same power is apparent in the fragments now
detached from it, because the effect depends on the concatenation.
Nevertheless, some of the passages are sufficiently long, and
sufficiently complete in themselves, to be read with interest, and with
some, though far from an adequate feeling of the author’s powers. We
would instance, particularly, his sketch of the middle, or, as he terms
it, the “uneasy” class (pp. 26-47).6

The passage in which is extracted most of the marrow of the book, is
that entitled “Ships, Colonies, and Commerce” (pp. 87-97).7 Some of the
passages from his writings on capital punishment, and on transportation,
bear extraction better; such as that most highly-wrought description of
a “Condemned Sermon:”8 but the interest in these topics is, for the
present, at least, comparatively suspended.

There are some few passages, mostly near the beginning, which we regret
to see; that, for instance, which is headed “The bold Peasantry of
England,”9 to which the author has had the grace to prefix “written in
1831;” but it would have been better, we think, not to have included
among his extracts a passage which the light since thrown upon the
condition of the people has shown to be fundamentally erroneous. The
peasantry are not, and were not, in the condition of physical privation
described in that passage; and the higher classes, though chargeable
with most of the other offences he imputes to them, were far from
meriting the reproach implied in such expressions as “they make rates of
wages, elaborately calculating the minimum of food that will keep
together the soul and body of a clodhopper.” [P. 7.] On the contrary
they produced boundless mischief by errors on the contrary side—that of
profuse distribution of relief, and misplaced humanity. Again, we
altogether question Mr. Wakefield’s position that gin-drinking is the
effect of poverty.10 The Poor Law Inquiry has gone far to establish
that, in the towns where alone gin-drinking prevails, the wages even of
the lowest class of labourers are such as utterly to preclude anything
like actual Edition: current; Page: [790] want where there is reasonable
industry and economy.11 We believe that the gin-drinking population is
the vicious population, not the indigent. We have objections to make to
some other passages, but we waive the invidious task of selecting the
bad particles from so much good. Mr. Wakefield’s fault as a writer is
that of overcolouring for effect, and his tints generally require to be
lowered a little to render them consistent with nature; but his
outlines—always bold—are generally correct. Some of his political
doctrines, we may add, require considerable qualifications.

We cannot close without expressing our great admiration of the narrative
and dramatic power displayed in the historical sketch of the recent
political events in England, which Mr. Wakefield has given us in his
England and America, and which we wish he had reprinted entire.12 The
fragments of it which he has given in this volume, though sufficient to
recal our fading reminiscences, can convey no adequate conception to
those to whom the great original is not known. We quote, however, one
passage:

At length, on the memorable 1st of March, 1831, the Whig cabinet
produced their bill, themselves alone being aware of its contents until
it was laid before the House of Commons.

An abstract of the Whig bill would not describe it so well as an account
of its reception by the three great parties which then divided the
country.

The Conservatives, including those who quarreled with Wellington on
account of Catholic relief, were delighted with the bill; they chuckled,
and laughed, and clapped their hands. Was there ever, said they,
anything so extravagant? The Whigs must be mad: thank God, they had gone
far enough. Such a bill! revolutionary was too good an epithet for it.
So ridiculous, so preposterous a bill would not be read a first time.
The Whigs must resign; they had cut their own throats; nothing could be
better.

The feeling of the moderate Reformers was expressed by one of the
richest men in England, a Whig, but leaning to utilitarian opinions. He
declared in the House of Commons, that the bill took away his breath.
Perhaps he was affected, not so much by the bill itself, as by the
evidence, which the introduction of such a bill by the cabinet furnished
of the force of the popular will.

The decided enemies of the Constitution having examined the bill,
said—It is a good first step: pass it, pass it!13

We know not whether this passage, standing by itself, will be felt by
others as Edition: current; Page: [791] we feel it, who are acquainted
with the whole of which it is but a minute part; but to us it seems that
a history of England, written in this style, would be one of the most
popular historical productions ever printed.


284.: THE SALE OF COLONIAL LAND
 TRUE SUN, 22 FEB., 1837, P. 3

A Select Committee on the Disposal of Colonial Lands, for which Henry
Ward was responsible and which he chaired, had been appointed on 8 June,
1836. On 31 Jan., 1837, Ward gave notice in the Commons of his intention
to bring forward on 21 Feb. a bill for the sale and distribution of
waste lands in the British colonies to encourage and support emigration
(not in PD; reported in The Times, 1 Feb., p. 3). He did not, however,
present his motion on 21 Feb., nor on 2 May, as he had said on 9 Mar.
that he would (again not in PD; see The Times, 10 Mar., p. 4). Mill’s
article, his only contribution to the True Sun, appears to have been
written to free W.J. Fox, its editor, to write for the London and
Westminster (Mill had need himself for relief in these busy months). On
15 Mar., 1837, thanking W.J. Fox for his “Bulwer’s Tragedies,” which
appeared in the April number of the London and Westminster, pp. 247-70,
Mill says: “I would gladly, whenever possible, give a good many articles
to T.S. for such another” (EL, CW, Vol. XII, p. 331). The unheaded
leader is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A leading article in the
True Sun of 22d February 1837, on Mr. Ward’s intended motion respecting
the sale of land in the colonies”

(MacMinn, p. 48).

the examiner once speaking of the course which a Liberal Ministry and
House of Commons should take with a Tory House of Lords, pithily and
expressively described that course in these words: “Bombard it with good
measures.”1 For the first time, the Radicals in Parliament are holding
this same course towards the House of Commons itself and towards the
Ministry; bombarding them with good measures. How often in every year
since 1832, have the Radicals been consulted, urged, entreated to do
this—and in vain; but they are bidding fair now to redeem all past
errors, thanks to the spirit and energy which a few of their younger
members, men who have grown up to political maturity during those years
of inaction, at length seem to be infusing into the hitherto inert body
of Parliamentary Radicalism.

Among the propositions about to be brought forward by Radical members,
there is one, the importance of which may possibly escape notice, but
which if Edition: current; Page: [792] carried would produce a more
immediate and obvious benefit to the industrious classes generally, and
to the labouring class above all, than even the great constitutional
changes which we are contending for. We allude to Mr. Ward’s motion, for
regulating the sale of public lands in the Colonies, or as it might
appropriately be termed, for bridging over the Atlantic. It is, briefly,
a most effectual and well conceived plan for making emigration pay its
own expenses; by which, if practicable on a sufficient scale (and that
it is so we have no manner of doubt) the whole labouring population of
Great Britain and Ireland might, in spite of Corn Laws and the tax
gatherer, very soon come into the enjoyment of American wages, as surely
as they would if these two islands could actually hoist sail and cast
anchor off the American coast.

The means are no other than those the efficacy of which has for years
been so powerfully enforced in the various publications of the original
and vigorous author of England and America.2 The Government of the
United States sells all its waste lands, and by their sale raises a
revenue exceeding the entire expense of the Federal Government. The
waste lands in the transmarine possessions of this country have till
lately been given, not sold; it is proposed that they should be sold,
and the proceeds of the sale appropriated by act of Parliament, towards
defraying the expense of carrying out labourers to cultivate them. In
order that the money may go as far as possible towards the object, it is
proposed to limit the emigration to young married couples, in order that
the greatest power of future increase may be carried out at the smallest
expense. It is unnecessary to say that no emigration is contemplated,
but such as is, in the fullest sense of the word, voluntary: nothing so
monstrous being thought of, as that any persons should be compelled to
emigrate, either by direct means, or by the indirect method of making
the relief of their necessities dependent upon that condition.

It is well known that labour, in a new country, when aided by the means
and appliances3 of civilization, is very greatly more productive than it
is in the old countries of Europe. Every party of emigrants, therefore,
who go out, produce so much more by their labour in America or
Australia, than they produce in England, that the surplus would probably
in a single year more than repay the expenses of their passage; and thus
perpetually renew the fund for carrying out other emigrants. The
proposed plan, however, does not call upon emigrants to repay the
expenses of their passage. It relies upon a different principle. Each
set of emigrants so increases the resources and the wealth of the
country in which they settle, that the means there exist of cultivating
more land, and more land therefore (we may safely conclude) will be
purchased. The purchase-money is to be applied to the very purpose which
is most advantageous to the purchaser, namely, to providing him with the
hired labour necessary for making his land Edition: current; Page: [793]
yield the greatest net return. But while thus the colony will be not a
loser but eminently a gainer by what it pays, these payments will form a
perpetual, and for a long time a constantly increasing fund for
defraying the expenses of emigration; since the greater the emigration
the more land will be taken, and the more land is taken, the greater
will be the means of further emigration.

For the calculations which have been made as to the probable amount of
the emigration fund, and the immense effect which the subtraction of so
many labourers, consisting exclusively of young married couples, would
have upon the market for labour in this country, and especially in
Ireland, the reader may refer to the various publications on the
subject. But we can add our own testimony to that of Mr. Ward, when he
affirms in his late pamphlet, that he has never known any sensible man
who did not become a convert to these views when he could once be
prevailed upon to apply his mind to the question.4 Some striking
instances of this were afforded in the last session, when a committee of
the House of Commons (Mr. Ward himself was the chairman) containing some
of the most able and influential men of all parties, most of whom were
new to the subject, entered into a full investigation of it, and ended
by almost unanimously adopting the views on which Mr. Ward’s intended
motion is founded.5

We understand that the motion will be opposed by Ministers, that is, by
the Colonial Office, which like most other Governments and departments
of Governments, does not like to divest itself of arbitrary power: but
we believe that not only the bulk of the Radicals, but many of the most
influential men of the Tories, will vote with Mr. Ward, and that the
Ministry will have the almost undivided discredit of resisting, and
vainly resisting, the most important proposition for the physical
well-being of the working classes, which ever, perhaps, came before the
British Legislature.


285.: COMMERCIAL CRISIS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
 GUIDE, 29 APR., 1837, PP. 13-14

The American “Panic of 1837” in March, preceded by inflation, credit
expansion, and wild speculation in public lands, was marked by bank
failures and refusal to convert notes into specie. Nine States defaulted
on interest due on European debts. This is apparently the only original
article contributed by Mill to the Guide, founded on 22 Apr. by his
friend Henry Cole (1808-82). It appeared in “Commercial & Housekeeper’s
Guide,” a regular feature. The article is not listed in Mill’s
bibliography, but in Cole’s file copy in the Victoria and Albert Museum
he has written “J. Mill” at the head, as he has above an extract (in the
Guide, 18 June, 1837, p. 68) from a review of Carlyle’s French Edition:
current; Page: [794] Revolution, which Mill had already written for the
July number of the London and Westminster (CW, Vol. XX, pp. 131-66; the
extract is from pp. 134-6).

the recent intelligence from america has caused a most salutary
revolution in the state of commercial confidence, and justifies us in
saying that the most critical period of the mercantile pressure has now
past.1 It was feared that when the difficulties of the American houses
in England became known in America, and produced their natural
consequences, in a crash among the mercantile houses of the United
States, those houses would satisfy their American engagements first, and
their English creditors when they could. Dependent as our American
houses were for the fulfilment of their engagements here, upon a speedy
repayment of some portion of their advances to America, such conduct, on
the part of their American correspondents, would have compelled nearly
the whole of them to stop payment; and how far the ruin which this would
have spread through the trading communities of England might have
extended, or where it might have terminated, no one could venture to
divine.

All this evil has been averted by the spirited conduct of the Bank of
the United States, who, by stepping forward as the saviours of the
commercial credit of their country, will have far more than
re-established all the popularity of which General Jackson’s determined
hostility can have deprived them.2 They immediately lent their credit to
the merchants, to the extent of two millions of dollars; and granted
bills to that amount to enable them to pay their debts, and specie to
meet those bills is now on its way to this country. The other Banks
emulated their example; and, as the engagements of the leading Banks of
the United States are equal in security to cash, and bear a far higher
interest than can be obtained for cash anywhere but in America, the
merchants of America have met, or are enabled to meet, all their
engagements here; and the pressure upon our mercantile houses, trading
with America, may be considered at an end.


286.: NICHOL’S VIEWS OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE HEAVENS
 EXAMINER, 6 AUG., 1837, P. 49

John Pringle Nichol (1804-59) was a friend of Mill’s who helped him in
the preparation of his Logic (see CW, Vol. VII, pp. lvii-lxiii,
954-1110). Originally a clergyman, who lost his faith and became a
teacher, writer, and newspaper editor, Nichol was appointed Regius
Professor of Astronomy at Glasgow in 1836. Mill’s review, in the
“Literary Examiner,” is headed “Views of the Architecture of the
Heavens. In a Series of Letters to Edition: current; Page: [795] a Lady.
By J.P. Nichol, LL.D., F.R.S.E., Professor of Practical Astronomy in the
University of Glasgow. Tait, Edinburgh; Simpkin and Marshall, London.
[1837.]” It is identified in his bibliography as “A notice of Nichol’s
Architecture of the Heavens, in the Examiner for 6th August 1837”

(MacMinn, p. 49).

professor nichol is well known in Scotland as one of the most popular of
all living lecturers on natural science, and especially on the subject
of his present publication—Practical Astronomy. He is less generally,
but still extensively, known as one of Scotland’s best political
writers; one of her most active and efficient champions of liberal
opinions; a political economist of the first rank, as well as an
accomplished mathematician; and one who has carried into physical
science a sounder philosophy than most mathematicians. At present he
comes before us as a popular expositor of a most captivating science, in
one of its branches which has still all the attractions of novelty, and
which has never yet been treated in a popular manner. Mr. Nichol is the
first who has made accessible to the general reader the brilliant
discoveries and speculations of the two Herschels on the fixed stars;1
with all the extraordinary views as to the extent, constitution, and
history of the visible creation, which those discoveries and
speculations have opened. The perspicuity and eloquent fervour of these
letters will sustain Mr. Nichol’s reputation as a popular instructor. We
regret that, on a subject all whose parts are so intimately interwoven,
quotation is almost impossible. We select the following as one of the
most quotable passages, and one which well exemplifies Mr. Nichol’s
style of illustration:

Call up to your mind an Indian of that old America, when civilisation
had not yet disturbed the sombre twilight of its forests; suppose him of
a tribe whose wanderings had been confined far within the interior of a
range of primeval pines,—how natural for his untutored thought to
conceive the wood of his nativity infinite, or that space is all
occupied with trees! His eye had never lighted upon one external
object,—the forms of his infancy were the forms to which his manhood had
been alone accustomed; trees had always environed him, and hemmed in his
prospect; so that, on being informed by an instructed traveller of the
existence of free and wide savannahs, he must have seemed to hear of
something unintelligible and against nature, and have gazed with that
very incredulity which fills our minds at the idea of the great
firmament being limited like a forest—of our infinite being comprehended
within form. But lo!—in his stray wanderings—at a time when his gods
smiled upon him—the Indian arrives at a mountain, whose summit reaches
beyond the heights of the gigantic pines. He attempts it, overcomes its
precipices, and sees—a new world! The forest of his dwelling is mighty,
and stretches far; but America is mightier, and numbers of forests,
equal to his, luxuriate upon its plains. Where is our mountain, do you
ask,—where the height which can pierce these Edition: current; Page:
[796] skies? Indeed it is seldom found. Men wander through centuries, in
ancient ignorance, without reaching or scaling an elevation capable of
showing them beyond it; but in propitious hour, and after long
preparation, genius and industry descry it, and straightway the scales
fall from our sight. It was the telescope which, in this case, carried
us into outer regions, and revealed their contents—hitherto unseen by
human eye; and most splendid is the perspective. Divided from our
firmament and each other by measureless intervals, numerous firmaments,
glorious as ours, float through immensity, doubtless forming one
stupendous system, bound together by fine relationships. These
remarkable masses are located so deep in space, that to inferior
telescopes they seem like faint streaks or spots of milky light upon the
blue of the sky; but the instruments which had just been summoned into
being resolve their mystery, and disclose their myriads of stars. One of
these objects, perhaps the most brilliant in the heavens, is represented
in Plate I: it is in the constellation Hercules. After all, how easy the
belief to its indwellers, that a mass thus surpassingly gorgeous is
infinite. What wonder, although the inhabitant of a planet revolving
around one of its central suns, should have mistaken his own magnificent
heavens for the universe, and needed the distant and dim vision of our
firmament, appearing to his telescopes as a starry speck, to remove the
veil from his mind, and give him juster notions of the majesty of
creation!

These are truths which, although startling at first, are found so much
in harmony with the scheme of nature, that we are soon chiefly
astonished that they never occurred to us before: and I can conceive
circumstances in which the Indian, after the foregoing revelation had
been made to him, would not fail to descry among the internal aspects of
his forest, not only distinct intimations of its limitude, but also of
its peculiar shape, and even approximate dimensions. Think of the
appearances, which would be mainly remarked by an observant man, as
characteristic of his position, were the forest infinite or very
extensive. In his immediate vicinity the surrounding trees would be well
defined, and of the largest proportions; behind these he would see
another range, smaller, but also well defined, and so on through many
gradations of size and distinctness, until individual trees could no
longer be distinguished, and the view would terminate in an unnamed and
vague appearance, which I may be permitted to call a diffused woodiness.
But if this peculiar background were not seen in every direction, the
light of the sky appearing through the trees in different places, the
conclusion would be just and manifest, that the forest had not the
characteristics of one stretching out indefinitely or even equally on
all sides, that in some directions its edges were nearer than in others,
or that it was merely a group or stripe of trees having boundaries, and
of a particular and ascertainable shape. With these fresh lights turn
again to the heavens, asking what is the case with them? If we were in
the interior of an infinite and regular stratum, appearances would
necessarily be nearly similar all around us—the aspect of the sky on one
side would be almost its picture on every other side. The same, or
nearly the same number of visible bodies would, as in the infinite
forest, be found everywhere; and there would come from behind in all
directions, through those recesses in which no single star could be
descried, something of the same amount of whitish or milky illumination,
arising from the combined effulgence of luminaries individually unseen.
But this does not accord with actual phenomena, which rather agree with
the second form of our illustration. It is only when we look towards the
Milky Way, that these bodies seem to retire indefinitely, and finally to
be lost in a diffused starriness; and in all other places the intervals
between the luminaries are nearly quite dark, as if there we were closer
on the edges of our bed of stars, and therefore saw through it into the
external and obscure vacancies of space. The opinion is thus forced on
us anew, that we are in the midst of a mere group or cluster of stars,
and moreover, that it is a group of peculiar configuration, narrow, but
greatly elongated in the line of the Milky Way.

287.: MOLESWORTH’S ADDRESS TO THE ELECTORS OF LEEDS
 SPECTATOR, 2 DEC., 1837, P. 1149, and MORNING CHRONICLE, 4 DEC., 1837, P. 1

At the opening of Parliament on 20 Nov., 1837, the Radicals had tried to
amend the Address to the Throne to include franchise extension, the
ballot, and shorter parliaments. Russell had, for the ministry, replied
that such legislation would undermine the stability of British
institutions. Mill hoped for effective Radical cohesion in response, as
he indicates in a letter to J.P. Nichol of 21 Dec., saying that he had
“raved and stormed with no effect, but that of being thought an
impracticable enthusiast.” Mill’s Radical friend Molesworth had been
M.P. for Leeds since July. Mill’s letter continues: “M.’s address to the
Leeds people was put forward on the failure of our attempt to obtain a
collective demonstration” (EL, CW, Vol. XII, p. 365). In fact, the
address was Mill’s, as his bibliographic entry indicates: “The whole
(except a few words at the beginning and end) of Sir W. Molesworth’s
address to the Electors of Leeds reprinted in the Spectator of 3d
December 1837 and in the Morning Chronicle of the following day”
(MacMinn, p. 49). (Mill is wrong as to the date: the Spectator, a
Saturday paper, appeared on the 2nd, and the Morning Chronicle, a daily,
on Monday the 4th.) It seems likely that the first and the concluding
paragraphs are Molesworth’s. The text below is that of the Spectator,
where it is headed “To the Electors of Leeds / 79, Eaton Square / 29th
Nov. 1837”; in the Morning Chronicle the Eaton Square address is at the
bottom. The variant readings derive from the Morning Chronicle
(identified in the notes as MC).

fellow-citizens,—As it appears to me most desirable that the body of
Electors should on all important occasions clearly understand the
conduct of their Representative, in order that, if they approve of that
conduct, they may give to his voice the weight and sanction of their
approbation, and he may not appear to express in the House of Commons
only his own individual opinions, but those of his constituents; and as
the present is an occasion on which those Members of the House of
Commons who were elected to promote Reform, stand peculiarly in need not
only of the tacit approbation but of the active and energetic support of
all throughout the country who share their principles; I now address
you, my constituents, and inhabitants of one of the first among the
great manufacturing and trading communities of the empire, to claim from
you that support.

For the last three years the Reformers of Great Britain and Ireland
have, with signal moderation and forbearance, abstained from forcing
upon the consideration of the Legislature their opinions on the
extensive failure of the Reform Act, and the necessity of further
measures to protect the People in the exercise of the rights which that
enactment professed to give. I am persuaded that I am interpreting the
motives of this forbearance rightly, when I say that it did not arise
from any notion that such measures of protection could possibly be much
longer dispensed with. You knew that when the party who have the great
properties in their hands could recover from the shock of the first
great defeat which they have ever sustained since the Revolution of
1688, they would find Edition: current; Page: [798] that the means of
corruption and intimidation which they still possess, and which they can
never cease to possess under any system of open voting, are much more
than sufficient to give them as sure a majority in the Reformed House of
Commons as they had in the Rotten Borough Parliament. You knew this; but
the danger was not yet imminent; the Tories were still in a minority,
though a large one; the language of the Whig Ministers was continually
giving you hopes that if bribery and intimidation continued, and could
not be arrested by other means, they would become converts, however
unwillingly, to the Ballot.1 You imagined these professions to be
sincere; and as the progress of events was producing every day more and
more the evidences which Ministers professed to be still in want of,—as
moreover, you believed what was frequently insinuated by their friends,
that their hands were tied up by engagements with the late King, from
which a new reign would set them free,2—you continued to bear, with what
patience you could, the disappointment of your hopes and the tyranny of
your Tory taskmasters, rather than be called by the Whig Ministers
impatient, violent, and unreasonable.

By this conduct you at least showed that you did not deserve any such
imputation: so much so, indeed, that it has subjected you to a directly
contrary one—that of being apathetic, of being indifferent to Reform,
and even of having undergone a reaction in favour of Toryism; and this,
as I can inform you, and as you must have learnt from the recent speech
of Lord John Russell,3 is the language currently held concerning you at
the present time, not only by Tories but by Whigs.

That the conduct which has subjected the People of England to this
disgraceful accusation was wrong, it is not for me, nor have I any
inclination, to assert. I address you for a different purpose,—to
proclaim to you, if any such proclamation be necessary, that the season
afora this quiet, deferential, and submissive course of proceeding, has
now ended. The Ministers have declared that they were not prevented from
supporting the Ballot by any engagements with the Sovereign, but by
their own rooted hostility to it. Lord John Russell has chosen the very
time when his supporters were smarting under the persecutions they have
suffered to keep him in office—he has chosen that very time to declare
that they shall never, with his consent, be shielded from those
persecutions. At the very opening of the last Parliament in which,
unless the Ballot be made a Edition: current; Page: [799] Cabinet
question, his party will ever have the majority,—and while it is still
uncertain whether they will continue to have it even in this,—he has
declared the fact, which for the last three years has been sedulously
disguised, that the Reform Act is to him a final measure; and that if
the Tories cannot be kept out without a measure to give effect to that
act according to the declared intentions of its supporters, the Tories
must come in.

I do not say these things for the purpose of complaint; nor do I seek to
excite you to that indignation which I do not affect to deny that I
think you might justly feel. My object is to impress upon you that the
time is come when all temporizing—all delicacy towards the Whigs—all
fear of disuniting Reformers, or of embarrassing Ministers by pressing
forward reforms, must be at an end. If you wish for the Ballot,—if you
wish for Triennial Parliaments,—if you wish for the Extension of the
Suffrage, or its distribution so as to diminish the exorbitant and
uncontrollable power of the great landholders, of the men who tax your
bread and fetter your industry,—byoub must say it in the teeth of both
the Aristocratic Factions, now avowedly united to resist cthesec just
and necessary improvements. You must be prepared steadily to look in the
face the unfortunate but nowise astonishing fact, that not only from the
House of Lords, but from a large majority of the House of Commons, you
never will obtain either the Ballot or any of the other measures to
which I have referred, but by such a demonstration of your will as those
bodies shall not dare to resist. You must be prepared for a struggle as
arduous as that which carried the Reform Bill, to extort these measures
from both the parties of the Aristocracy and from both Houses of
Parliament. Nothing can now be done for you within the walls of the
House: your faithful Representatives have no power there but that which
you give them: it is for you, by a great and simultaneous demonstration
throughout the country, to enable your Representatives to speak, not
with their own single voices, but with the voices of assembled millions.

If the hangers-on of the Ministry should seek, as they inevitably will,
to dissuade you from this declaration of your sentiments, on pretence
that it will damage the Ministry, tell them that the Ministry is already
doomed. The Ministry themselves know that, without the Ballot, the
Tories cannot be kept out of office longer, at the utmost, than till the
next General Election. They have made their late declaration in the full
knowledge of this; and would never have made it, if they had not fully
determined to rest their chance of remaining in office upon being able
to persuade the Tories that Tory objects can be better promoted by them
than by a Tory Ministry. And, truly, I know not what objects, but Tory
objects, they are likely to promote; or what those great prospects of
amelioration are, which it is supposed would be injured, if we were to
“embarrass the Edition: current; Page: [800] Government”4 by standing
forth in the face of the world and declaring our opinions. All the
reforms which they propose, are the merest trifles compared with the
evils to be removed; and even those they can only propose, but cannot
carry. If they ever carry them, it will be only by the terror of your
voices, demanding things infinitely greater. All experience proves that
unwilling rulers can be more easily induced to concede great reforms
than small ones; that so long as the people are satisfied with demanding
little, even that little is refused; but when they have raised their
demands to something considerable, much more than the little they at
first asked is eagerly thrown to them, in the hope of allaying the storm
of dissatisfaction which then, for the first time, their masters are
willing to consider formidable.

If the People are tired of the pursuit of good government,—if the fruits
of seven years of painful struggle are now to be thrown away, and they
are willing to bend their necks once more under the yokes of their
former masters,—if the cry of Reform never meant any thing with them, or
was raised only to please the Whigs, and is to be abandoned because the
Whig placemen abandon it,—if the name only and not the substance of
Popular Representation was all that the People sought,—then indeed,
sincere Reformers will feel bitterly disappointed—will confess they have
been mistaken in the character of their fellow countrymen—and though
they may not slacken their efforts in behalf of the principles which
they profess, their hopes must then be limited to keeping those
principles alive for better times and for a new generation.

But if in their exertions and sacrifices for the Reform Bill, the People
were contending not for a mere word, but for a reality,—if they were
then, and still are, for the principle proclaimed by Lord Grey,
“Representation, not Nomination,”5—if in demanding the Reform of the
House of Commons, and in fighting and conquering under its banner, they
were not the puppets of a faction, but really meant what they
said—really believed they had a right to what they claimed, and are
still willing to stand by their first purpose, against the Whigs if need
be, with the same determination with which, at the call of the Whigs,
they stood against the Tories,—then every town, every district, if
possible every parish in the kingdom, ought to hold its meeting and send
its petition to Parliament for the Ballot, with or without an extension
dandd equalization of the Suffrage. The People, not the Whigs, carried
the Reform Bill; the People, by their demonstrations throughout the
country, compelled the one party to propose and the other to pass it.
What they then did, they may do again. They conquered Edition: current;
Page: [801] once, they can conquer a second time. They have only to
speak, and the sound of their voice will scatter the hosts of their
enemies.

eNowe let them make that voice heard. Now do you, citizens of Leeds, set
the example. Now raise again the standard of Reform; and you will merit
the eternal gratitude of your countrymen.

Your faithful Representative,

William Molesworth


288.: EXCEPTION TO THE OBJECTIONS TO NOMINAL PUNISHMENTS
 EXAMINER, 16 SEPT., 1838, PP. 578-9

Lord Durham, who had gone to Canada after the rebellion of 1837 as High
Commissioner, had been defended by Mill in “Lord Durham and His
Assailants” in the 2nd ed. of the London and Westminster for August 1838
(CW, Vol. VI, pp. 437-43). The Examiner had printed two replies,
probably by Fonblanque himself. The first, “Lord Durham and His
Assailants,” 26 Aug., pp. 529-30, was a very favourable notice; the
second, “Reasoning for Nominal Punishments,” 2 Sept., p. 545, was
critical of Mill’s defence of the provision for capital punishment in
Durham’s “An Ordinance to Provide for the Security of the Province of
Lower Canada,” PP, 1837-38, XXXIX, 914-16. This letter to the editor, in
the “Political Examiner,” defends the punishment. Headed as title, with
the subhead “To the Editor of the Examiner,” it is signed “A.,” as was
Mill’s “Lord Durham and His Assailants.” It is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “A letter in defence of the last mentioned article
[i.e., his “Lord Durham and His Assailants”], in the Examiner of 16
Sept. 1838”

(MacMinn, p. 51).

sir,—

In the second of two very flattering notices which you have bestowed on
the article in the London and Westminster Review, entitled “Lord Durham
and his Assailants,” you have animadverted rather strongly on one
sentence of the article, in which, speaking of the capital penalty
denounced for the violation of Lord Durham’s Ordinance of Banishment,
the writer says, “The penalty is capital because that is the usual
penalty of state offences, and properly so, since any inferior
punishment might be a premium on the offence, while, by denouncing the
highest penalty of all, no necessity is incurred of actually inflicting
it;”1 and you express, in a very courteous manner, your surprise that
the author of the article should have overlooked the important
principle, that the law should not denounce a severer punishment than it
would be proper actually to inflict, and that punishments should be mild
in order that they may be certain.

As the accusation of forgetting so important a principle of criminal
legislation is one to which the author of the article feels particularly
sensitive, perhaps you Edition: current; Page: [802] will permit him to
assure you that the imputation is by no means deserved, and that instead
of seeing in the mode of dealing with state offences, which he defended,
any infringement of that great principle, he saw in it one of the
exceptions which prove the principle. The sentiment which he expressed
was grounded on the recognized, and, as on reflection you will certainly
feel it, the just, distinction between political and ordinary criminal
offences. The principle you so justly contend for is grounded on a most
cogent reason, namely, that certainty in punishments has a greater
effect than severity; but this reason is, as all philosophic jurists
have acknowledged, and as you must at once see, entirely inapplicable to
what are essentially the offences of multitudes. Certainty of punishment
is neither desirable nor possible in cases of rebellion. It is desirable
that no person whatever who commits theft or burglary should escape
unpunished: is it desirable that no person whatever who joins in a
rebellion should escape without suffering the penalties of the law? If
the principle you contend for were applicable to political offences, an
amnesty would be the most monstrous absurdity in all legislation. Who
would endure to hear of an amnesty for robbery or murder? But in the
case of rebellion the most savage tyrant hardly ever thinks of punishing
with the arm of the law any but a few leaders; thus completely setting
aside the principle of certainty of punishment. If the penalty for
treason instead of death were but a fine of one shilling, no one would
think of inflicting even that upon every individual of a defeated party.

Indeed, between state offences and all other offences there is this
great difference: in the case of any other offence, to remedy the
immediate evil which has been produced is a minor object, and the great
purpose of punishment is example: but in the case of offences which
arise out of the disaffection of the people with their government, and
which aim at a change of government, the grand object is the immediate
object, that of pacifying the country; punishment ought never to be
carried beyond what is necessary to remedy the present evil, to prevent
the present malcontents from breaking out again; if that can be
prevented, and the country brought to a settled state without any
punishment, there ought to be no punishment: there never should be any
for the purpose of deterring future malcontents from future
insurrections. The security against future discontents is the strength
of the government (proved by the failure of the insurrection), and the
goodness of the government (which it ought to lose no time in
demonstrating by its healing measures). The rule for punishment is—for
private offences punish mildly, that you may punish everybody: for
offences connected with a rebellion, punish nobody, if you can
tranquillize the country without punishment; but if you must punish,
punish as few persons and as mildly as is consistent with that object.
And on these principles all governments act more or less; all wise and
humane governments altogether.

There is therefore no inconsistency in saying that for this kind of
offences the severest penalty of the law should be denounced, although
in most cases it ought Edition: current; Page: [803] not to be executed.
You can never be sure beforehand that you can restore tranquillity
without punishing those who may attempt to disturb it afresh; and since
any punishment less than death may be less than the temptation to the
offence, it is necessary to reserve the option of inflicting the highest
punishment known to the law in case it should be necessary. But, as it
is not proper to inflict any punishment unless the state of the country
require it, so it is proper to inflict the mildest which the state of
the country admits of, although the highest of all is and ought to be
denounced.

To sum up all in a few words, insurrectionary offences differ from
others in this, that in all other cases punishment, but in this case
pardon, ought to be the general rule—or mitigation of punishment, when
pardon would be unsafe. Other penal laws are made to be implicitly
executed; laws against rebellion are made not to be executed without the
most imperative necessity.

These, Sir, are no novelties; I am merely vindicating the received
doctrines of statesmen and the established practice of all civilized
governments; and the principles I have laid down are so completely in
accordance with the general spirit of your writings on such topics, that
your concurrence in them may be confidently anticipated.

A.


289.: PETITION FOR FREE TRADE
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 17 JUNE, 1841, P. 6

When he drafted this petition, Mill had published nothing in the
newspapers for thirty-three months; in the interval he had been busy
with the London and Westminster and with the writing of his Logic. On 17
June, 1841, he wrote to Fonblanque: “The Kensington petition, printed in
the Chronicle today, is of my writing, & I had a great share in getting
up the public meeting, which, though in a very unpromising
neighbourhood, was a very striking demonstration” (EL, CW, Vol. XIII, p.
478). The item is headed “Kensington. The following is the petition
agreed to at the meeting held at Kensington on Tuesday evening,” with a
subhead: “To the Honourable the House of Commons.” It is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “The Kensington Petition for free-trade, agreed
to at a public meeting held on the 15th June 1841, and printed in the
Morning Chronicle of June 17th” (MacMinn, p. 53). The petition is also
in CW, Vol. V, pp. 761-3

(App. B).

the humble petition of the inhabitants of Kensington and its vicinity,
in public meeting assembled, sheweth,

That protecting duties, or, in other words, duties imposed on foreign
commodities, not to raise a revenue, but to keep up the price of similar
articles produced at home, are a tax on the whole community for the
pecuniary profit of some class or classes, and are therefore an abuse of
the power of legislation.

That the argument frequently urged in defence of such duties, namely,
that Edition: current; Page: [804] they encourage production and favour
the national industry, is, in the opinion of your petitioners, not only
unfounded, but the very reverse of the truth, inasmuch as employments
which would not be carried on without an artificial high price, are by
this very circumstance proved to be employments yielding of themselves a
less return than that which the same amount of labour and capital would
realise if left to take its natural course. A smaller production is by
this means obtained through the sacrifice of a greater, and thus, in
addition to what these restrictions take from one portion of the
community to bestow upon another, they cause a further and commonly a
still greater loss of national wealth, without benefit to any one.

That nevertheless former Parliaments, partly influenced by the class
interests of their several members, and partly by mistaken views of
public policy now exploded, have imposed protecting duties on almost
every article of foreign produce or manufacture which could possibly
come into competition with anything produced in our own country or its
dependencies, thus throwing upon the public, in the increased price of
the articles of their expenditure, burdens which, according to the
calculations of the best practical authorities, exceed the amount of all
the taxes which the people of this country pay to the state, while of
this vast sum a very small portion alone reaches the coffers of the
various classes of producers whom the legislature intended to benefit.

That of these burdens, the most revolting in its principle, the largest
in its amount, and the severest in its pressure, is the tax on food,
imposed by the present corn and provision laws.1

That a tax on food is the only tax from which no degree of abject
poverty is an exemption, but which in its very nature falls heaviest
upon the poorest class, nearly the whole of whose consumption consists
of food.

That whatever makes the poor poorer, tends in the same proportion to
render them ignorant and vicious, by depriving them of the opportunities
and means of good education, while it strengthens and multiplies the
temptations to which their condition exposes them. That the corn-laws,
as producing these effects, are, in the view of your petitioners,
opposed both to the first principles of morality and to the spirit of
the Christian religion, as well as to the direct precepts of Scripture,
which expressly declares,

“He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him; but blessing
shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.”2

That, as your honourable house are doubtless aware, there exists, and
has for some time existed, in a considerable portion of the labouring
classes, a deeply seated hostility to existing political institutions,
and in the country generally a growing alienation among the different
ranks of society, the causes of which, Edition: current; Page: [805]
your petitioners humbly submit, demand the most serious consideration
from your honourable house.

That, so far as your petitioners are able to observe, these evils
originate in the persuasion openly entertained by large bodies of
persons that the ruling principle in the government of this country is
not the public good, but the particular interest of certain classes, who
command a majority, both in the other house of Parliament and in your
honourable house. Your petitioners respectfully express their conviction
that nothing has so much contributed to give rise to this unfortunate
impression, or has given so much colour of truth to it, as the existing
commercial restrictions, and in particular the corn-laws. That by
whatever arguments the supporters of those laws may justify themselves
to their own minds, their reasons are not of a nature to be convincing
or intelligible to persons whose small loaf is made smaller for no
purpose apparent to them but that of still further enriching the rich. A
bread tax for the supposed benefit of the landlords, and a people well
affected to the state, are two things which, in the opinion of your
petitioners, cannot easily co-exist.

That, entertaining these opinions, your petitioners have hailed with joy
the announcement by her Majesty’s government of a general revision of
the existing import duties, and the introduction into your honourable
house of measures, by which some of the most oppressive of those duties,
and particularly, the most oppressive of all, the corn-laws, are
considerably relaxed.3 That although in the article of food nothing but
entire freedom from taxation would be satisfactory to your petitioners
as a permanent arrangement; yet, as a means of transition, to prevent
too sudden a shock to existing interests, your petitioners fully
subscribe to the propriety of retaining, for the present, a moderate
duty on imported corn. And your petitioners are strongly of opinion that
the protection thus temporarily conceded should be in the shape of a
fixed duty rather than of a sliding scale. Your petitioners can scarcely
imagine any mode of regulating a great branch of commerce and industry
more injurious to all parties than the present variable scale of duties,
under which the home grower can never know what degree of protection he
has to reckon upon, nor the importer what rate of duty he will be
required to pay.

That although the measures recently promulgated by her Majesty’s
government would have commanded, under any circumstances, the warmest
support of your petitioners, they derive an additional recommendation
from the Edition: current; Page: [806] particular time at which they are
proposed, namely, when the approaching revision of the duties levied on
our productions by several of our largest customers threatens us with
retaliatory measures most ruinous to our foreign trade, while the state
of our own revenue leaves us no option but either to lower the tariff,
or impose new and onerous taxes upon the property or the already
overburthened industry of the country.

Your petitioners, therefore, earnestly entreat your honourable house to
give your most serious consideration to these various circumstances, and
to adopt the measures recently submitted to you by her Majesty’s
government with respect to the duties on imports, and especially on
foreign corn.

And your petitioners will ever pray.


290.: STERLING’S THE ELECTION
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 29 JULY, 1841, P. 5

In a letter dated only “Wedy” (probably 28 July, 1841), Mill wrote to
John Black, his father’s old friend, and still editor of the Morning
Chronicle: “I have just been reading again that poem I told you of and I
liked it so much that I could not help sitting down and scribbling off a
hurried notice of it for you. Do with it as you please—I shall be glad
to see either that or any other notice of the book in the Chronicle.”
(EL, CW, Vol. XIII, p. 482.) The Election was by John Sterling
(1806-44), one of Mill’s most beloved friends, whom he met in the London
Debating Society as an antagonist, but soon found common ground with, in
part on the basis of Sterling’s admiration for Coleridge. The review, in
the “Literature” section, is headed “The Election: a Poem, in Seven
Books. [London:] Murray, 1841.” It is described in Mill’s bibliography
as “A notice of Sterling’s Poem of the Election, in the Morning
Chronicle of July 29th 1841”

(MacMinn, p. 53).

now, when the turmoil of real elections is for the present ended,1 we
may venture, perhaps, to solicit attention to a story of an election.
Let not the reader look askance at the publisher’s name, and ask,
whether any good, on the subject of elections, can come out of
Albemarle-street2—for this volume is a proof that even from that place
may issue the most biting satire upon Toryism, when, whatever is
low-minded and base on the other side of the question is satirized
likewise; and when the writer, though wielding satire with the hand of a
master, is capable of something better than any satire, and inculcates a
still higher thing than hate and scorn of what is bad, namely, love and
practice of what is noble. In Edition: current; Page: [807] truth, this
little narrative poem is equally remarkable for wisdom and high feeling,
and for wit; while in versification it has had no rival in satirical
poetry since Byron’s Age of Bronze.3

We quote the opening passage as an average specimen:

-   

    -   

        In some high region dwells a muse whose aid
    -   

        Helps modern geniuses to drive their trade,
    -   

        To circulating libraries imparts
    -   

        A spell commanding countless pence and hearts,
    -   

        And spreads o’er just three volumes sibylline
    -   

        The hero’s coats and passions, woes and wine.

-   

    -   

        Could I her influence feel, ’twere mine to show
    -   

        How lords and tailors rule this world below;
    -   

        How youths at clubs, while sipping coffee, solve
    -   

        The questions pedants through long life revolve;
    -   

        What love-sick pangs, how bravely borne, convulse
    -   

        The newest gold-flowered waistcoats made by Stultz;4
    -   

        How ghosts in gauze with poisoned fruit-knife stab
    -   

        E’en him who drives a coronetted cab;
    -   

        And fiends perfumed, not sulphurous, teach despair
    -   

        To souls that dine at eight in Belgrave-square.

-   

    -   

        But too refined the song that scales the heaven
    -   

        Of evening breakfasts, and Hyde-park at seven,
    -   

        And dares recount what metaphysic shocks
    -   

        Invade the bright world of an opera box,
    -   

        And draws its tones of mystical delight
    -   

        From well-bred London’s long Walpurgis-night.
    -   

        Not Fashion’s muse in lace and pearl awakes
    -   

        My rhapsody, but one that brews and bakes;
    -   

        A dowdy goddess in a printed gown
    -   

        Records the simple tale of Aleborough town.

-   

    -   

        With zealous heart I sing, but feeble voice,
    -   

        Great Britain’s boast, her sage electors’ choice;
    -   

        And those high days when Aleborough proudly sent
    -   

        Her man to sit in England’s Parliament.
    -   

        Thou muse of shouts and speeches! goddess wise,
    -   

        By whom inspired we hit on prosperous lies,
    -   

        Inform the song with such diviner sense
    -   

        As thou canst give to hustings eloquence;
    -   

        And with that downward use of the sublime,
    -   

        By critics called the Bathos, aid my rhyme!
    -   

        [Pp. 3-5.]

After this introduction, the tale begins with the following passage, of
which Edition: current; Page: [808] the first eight lines are in the
best style of Pope, while those which follow remind us of Crabbe:5

-   

    -   

        Cox represented Aleborough, patriot pure,
    -   

        On whose tried firmness Europe leant secure.
    -   

        But, woe to manufactures, land, and stocks!
    -   

        Europe and Aleborough could not rescue Cox.
    -   

        At London’s Mansion-house, the Poultry’s pride,
    -   

        Cox in his country’s service dined, and died.
    -   

        One cook by turtle slew a man, whom ten
    -   

        With all their art could not revive again.

-   

    -   

        The sun was setting o’er the old church tower,
    -   

        That glittered softly while it pealed the hour;
    -   

        And smoke, from many a chimney curling slow,
    -   

        Marked where the black tea-kettle steamed below:
    -   

        The aproned workman, tools in hand, sought out
    -   

        Some nook for meditation and brown stout;
    -   

        Small idle groups were chatting here and there,
    -   

        These near the Lion, those beside the Bear,
    -   

        Each heart by some grave theme alike possessed,
    -   

        The maid’s new ribbons, and the man’s old jest,
    -   

        The last fresh murder, and the price of hay,
    -   

        And how Ned Scroggs’ apprentice ran away.

-   

    -   

        Break off, ye triflers! Hark, a distant hum,
    -   

        And then a clatter, tells the coach is come.
    -   

        Two dames within, five dusty shapes above,
    -   

        A red-faced coachman, grand as thundering Jove,
    -   

        Dash through the admiring street, and crowding round
    -   

        Come ostlers, waiters, loiterers tow’rd the sound.
    -   

        Soon spreads the direful rumour unconfined—
    -   

        Cox—dead—our member! Horror strikes mankind;
    -   

        Shrugs, whispers, open mouths, and then, alas!
    -   

        Huge joy breaks out like flaring streams of gas.
    -   

        A new election! Glory to the town!
    -   

        For all there’s profit, and for some renown.
    -   

        The Lion opes his hungry jaws and springs,
    -   

        And the Black Bear seems dancing as he swings.
    -   

        [Pp. 5-6.]

Two candidates present themselves: Mogg, the Conservative; and Vane, the
Liberal. The author has worked up into the portrait of Mogg all the
features of a prosperous Tory chairman of quarter sessions, of which the
following, from the description of his Oxford career, is one of the most
characteristic:

-   

    Too wise to doubt on insufficient cause,
-   

    He signed old Cranmer’s lore6 without a pause;
-   

    Edition: current; Page: [809]
-   

    And knew that logic’s cunning rules are taught
-   

    To guard our creed, and not invigorate thought,
-   

    As those bronze steeds, at Venice kept for pride,
-   

    Adorn a town where not one man can ride.
-   

    [P. 8.]

The exemplifications of vice and folly on the Liberal side, are in the
persons of some of the candidate’s chief supporters; the candidate
himself being a man after the author’s own heart; and the history of his
previous life, together with a love story in which he is involved, and
which is not unskilfully connected with the election, form the serious
interest of the tale. It would be impossible to give any just idea of
this by extracts; and we shall, therefore, confine our quotations to the
satirical portion of the poem, taking them chiefly from the hustings
speech of the Conservative candidate, which contains, almost
prophetically, the quintessence of most of the Tory speeches since
delivered at the elections which have just concluded:

-   

    -   

        “Our boast is ‘British freedom;’ no one here
    -   

        Need learn, work, dress, or eat, from slavish fear.
    -   

        The rich their daily joint in freedom carve;
    -   

        The poorest men in equal freedom starve;
    -   

        And he who, naked, in a ditch expires,
    -   

        Yet dies with freedom, like his freeborn sires.
    -   

        Be this our pride! and be it ours to guard
    -   

        The sacred rights that fools would fain discard.
    -   

        I ask, has earth a spot where laws abound,
    -   

        So many, curious, ample, and profound?
    -   

        Where lawyers never strain their private wit
    -   

        To ask what’s reason, but proclaim what’s writ?
    -   

        Where else are all men equal, save that one
    -   

        Has lands and houses, and another none?
    -   

        A difference betwixt the mean and great,
    -   

        Which Heaven itself forbids to violate.

-   

    -   

        “I also love the church that claims our awe
    -   

        Tow’rds holy truth by force of statute law,
    -   

        And helps free grace to gain the soul’s assent,
    -   

        And cleanse our sins by act of Parliament:
    -   

        A loyal church, that keeps the rich and poor
    -   

        Duly apart, nor blends the lord and boor.
    -   

        ’Tis sweet to witness pews nor mean nor scant
    -   

        For those who pay—free seats for those who can’t;
    -   

        To hear a priest, too polished to be proud—
    -   

        A gentleman set up to teach the crowd,
    -   

        Not puffed by rabble votes to Wisdom’s chair,
    -   

        But by superior judgment settled there,
    -   

        And so discreetly teaching all to choose
    -   

        The path their betters fain would have them use.”
    -   

        [Pp. 67-8.]

-   

    “There’s one point more that must not be forborne:
-   

    My friends! I’m not at all for foreign corn.
-   

    Edition: current; Page: [810]
-   

    Let those who like it go abroad to eat
-   

    French rolls; to me a quartern loaf is sweet;
-   

    And while my shilling helps the farmer here,
-   

    I will not try to fatten thin mounseer.
-   

    It is no doubt a taking cry to bawl
-   

    ‘Cheap Bread!’ But what’s so dear as none at all?
-   

    As milliners, perhaps, the French are good;
-   

    But I’ll not trust them for my daily food,
-   

    Lest, when they see our bakers’ empty shelves,
-   

    They keep their musty flour to feed themselves,
-   

    And poor John Bull, who left his fields unsown,
-   

    Must kneel to them for crumbs, or munch a stone;
-   

    And dying children’s cries our bosoms wrench,
-   

    And beg in vain for victuals from the French.”
-   

    [P. 64.]

We have only room for one more extract; it is a satirical portrait of a
different kind:

-   

    -   

        She well became her fortune; handsome yet,
    -   

        With lineless brow, smooth cheeks, and hair of jet:
    -   

        A face, that plainly told two score of years,
    -   

        Had scarcely brought her eyes as many tears.
    -   

        A girl accomplished, graceful, calm, and fair,
    -   

        She seemed a pure wax-light in Grosvenor-square,
    -   

        Until beneath St. George’s fateful porch
    -   

        The virgin taper blazed as Hymen’s torch;
    -   

        A wife in highest vogue, correct, admired,
    -   

        In lauding whom the virtuous never tired;
    -   

        And who, could worth be caught from looks and tones,
    -   

        Had done more good than all the martyrs’ bones.
    -   

        In fine, a pattern, wont in all to show
    -   

        Her moral right to every good below.

-   

    -   

        Once by a concert singer’s drapery brushed,
    -   

        The spotless heart with indignation blushed,
    -   

        And dropping on the floor the cashmere woof,
    -   

        Preferred self-sacrifice to just reproof.
    -   

        But free from bigot pride, without a pang,
    -   

        She heard the songs of love the culprit sang;
    -   

        And when, at last, she left the shawl behind,
    -   

        These words alone expressed her hallowed mind—
    -   

        “It cost me fifty guineas: I declare
    -   

        The law should make such people take more care.”

-   

    -   

        Mild on the surface, though severe within,
    -   

        She never frowned except at vulgar sin;
    -   

        But still with soul of brass pursued her way,
    -   

        Nor e’en one hasty moment went astray.
    -   

        And she was cold to every wrong desire,
    -   

        As Alpine ice-peak to the lightning’s fire;
    -   

        While, not so circumspect, the neighbouring tree
    -   

        Admits the blaze and dies like Semele.
    -   

        Edition: current; Page: [811]
    -   

        In short, Diana shone on life’s frail stage
    -   

        The ideal Proper Person of her age;
    -   

        Her life was blazon’d Proper, and it bore
    -   

        Additions due of argent and of or.
    -   

        The goddess of Propriety could find
    -   

        No fitter Sybil to convert mankind;

        And as to blaming aught Diana did,

        Or daring anything by her forbid,

        One might almost as well maintain that we

291.: PUSEYISM [1]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 1 JAN., 1842, P. 3

The controversy within the Established Church of England over its
Catholicity, historically and doctrinally, was greatly heightened by the
publication of Tracts for the Times, which gave interpretations of the
Thirty-nine Articles that minimized their Protestantism, by a group
variously known as the “Tractarians,” the “Oxford Movement,” and the
“Puseyites.” The leaders were Edward Bouverie Pusey (1800-82), Regius
Professor of Hebrew at Oxford; John Keble (1792-1866), Professor of
Poetry at Oxford (1831-41) and vicar of Hursley, whose sermon on
national apostasy attacking Erastian liberalism had initiated the
movement in 1833; and John Henry Newman (1801-90), the greatest
controversialist of all, whose Tract 90 had given most offence. Mill’s
two letters on the subject (this and No. 292) were prompted by letters
in the Morning Chronicle in December 1841 by “Philo-Puseyite” (18th, p.
3, and 24th, p. 3) and by “Miso-Jesuit” (23rd, p. 3, and 30th, p. 3), as
well as by editorial attacks on the Puseyites (see the leading article
on the Oxford Professorship of Poetry, Morning Chronicle, 3 Dec., p. 2).
This item is headed “Puseyism,” with subhead, “To the Editor of the
Morning Chronicle.” The letters are described in Mill’s bibliography as
“Two letters on Puseyism, signed Historicus, in the Morning Chronicle of
12th [sic] and 13th January 1842”

(MacMinn, p. 54).

sir,—

I address you as one of, I believe, many who although most remote from
any connection, either personal, or through their opinions, with
Puseyism, have seen with pleasure the letters of “Philo-Puseyite,” in
the first place, because we Edition: current; Page: [812] agree with
that writer in a large portion of his sentiments, but also, and still
more, because we approve of the tone of mind, which is less eager to
hold up to obloquy the errors of an adversary, than conscientiously to
examine what portion of truth exists in those errors, and gives them
their plausibility. We not only esteem it a more healthful exercise of
the mind to employ itself in learning from an enemy, than in inveighing
against him; but, we believe, that the extirpation of what is erroneous
in any system of belief is in no way so much promoted as by extricating
from it, and incorporating into our own systems, whatever in it is true.
If your correspondent, “Miso-Jesuit,” had taken heed of these things, he
would probably have spared you his ill-tempered and uncourteous second
letter—a document which would prove, if such proof were required, that
there is nothing which a zealot, Christian or infidel, dissenter or
churchman, can so little pardon, or on which he is so incapable of
putting a candid interpretation as the offence of not going with him to
the full length of his narrow-minded antipathies.

It was scarcely needful for your correspondent to remind
“Philo-Puseyite” that the Oxford theologians would not thank him for
such advocacy as his, and that whoever stands up for toleration or
charity in their behalf claims for the Puseyites what the Puseyites
would not be willing to bestow.1 The leaders of this sect, for a sect it
is, are, as it is evident that “Miso-Jesuit” himself is, conscientious
bigots: like him, however, they are not bigots to error, but to one-half
of the truth; and are, in the present writer’s estimation, entitled to
the approbation and goodwill which he cannot but feel towards all such
persons, provided that the portion of truth they contend for is one
which the age specially needs, and provided (he must add) they have not
the power of burning him for heresy, a fate which, to say truth, if
their doctrines ever obtained the ascendancy in this country, he does
not well see how he could hope to escape. It is not, therefore, out of
any special partiality to them that he undertakes their apology. But not
to our friends alone is justice due from us and to the Puseyites; permit
me to say, it is more particularly due from your paper, inasmuch as you
have repeatedly in your leading articles done them cruel injustice, of
the kind likely to be most severely felt by conscientious men, and most
likely also to prejudice impartial bystanders against your good cause,
by your perpetual denunciations of them as hypocrites and
mammon-servers, because, holding doctrines which you (not they) deem
inconsistent with the articles of the church, they yet do not secede
from it.2

Can you be serious, sir, in addressing this particular reproach to men
of whom it is the distinctive feature, among all other religious
parties, to maintain that no difference of opinion whatever is capable
of justifying the sin of schism? That the first command of Christ is
adherence to the standard which he has erected upon earth, and for the
recognition of which he has appointed certain criteria, of which
Edition: current; Page: [813] the profession of a particular set of
theological tenets3 is not one; that even if the whole human race, one
person excepted, should desert that standard and set up another, by
proclaiming a church of man’s ordinance, not God’s, it is they who
apostatize, and he, that one person, be his opinions what they may, is
the Christian church upon earth; or if, instead of themselves seceding
from the communion, they forcibly exclude him from it (as the Romish
church did Luther),4 he refusing and protesting, they, by so doing,
constitute their church a schismatic body, while he remains a member of
the church as before! In common candour, sir, ask yourself whether
persons of whose belief this is a correct expression, are sacrificing
their principles to lucre because they do not take upon their
consciences what they esteem a deadly sin.

And since we are on the subject of interested motives, give me leave to
ask you, as a man acquainted with the world, and aware of the ordinary
course of affairs in political life, whether you do or can think other
of these men than that by professing their opinions they are abandoning
all hope of further advancement in worldly advantages? If the
extraordinary acquirements and powers, for example, of Mr. Newman had
been employed in any of the modes in which able men in the church of
England usually seek to distinguish themselves—in the paths, for
instance, by which Dr. Blomfield, or Dr. Philpotts rose to eminence,5 is
there any dignity in the Establishment to which he might not have
aspired? And do you believe that either the present government, or any
other ministry that could be formed, would dare to raise an avowed and
active Puseyite to episcopal, or any other high ecclesiastical honours?
Let me answer for you, sir. You know the contrary: you are not ignorant
of the sort of feelings with which practical politicians of every class
invariably regard the speculative men who formulize either into
philosophic theories or religious dogmas the extreme doctrines of their
own party. You know that those whose business is conciliation and
compromise, the smoothing of difficulties and the allaying of
apprehensions, do not hold their most determined adversaries in so much
dread as they do those who display to public view all the vulnerable
points in their system of opinions, in the manner most fertile of
misgiving to friends, and irritation to opponents, and proclaim as
sacred principles, to be acted upon without qualification or reserve,
all which they in their practice not only sedulously guard by countless
modifications and restrictions, but are so often forced, even honestly,
to surrender altogether, in Edition: current; Page: [814] points of
detail at least, on the summons of declared opponents. If we know this,
think you that Mr. Newman knows it not? Think you that a man so deeply
read in history, and who has analysed in so one-sided, but yet so
profound a manner, the course of the stream of human affairs from age to
age,6 is ignorant of what every school-boy knows, that the philosophers
of a creed are seldom its successful politicians?

It would do you credit, sir, to desist from these incessant attacks upon
the disinterestedness of the Oxford theologians, or to reserve them
until you find the Puseyites violating the doctrines of their own creed,
by disobeying the authority, canonically exercised, of their
ecclesiastical superiors. Such imputations of insincerity are applied
with a very bad grace to a party from whom, whatever may be said against
the reasonableness or the real Christianity of many of their doctrines,
this acknowledgment cannot be withheld, that instead of being insincere
members of the church, they are the only party in it who attempt, or
even pretend to attempt, to be perfectly sincere. I assert this without
qualification as one of the greatest, or rather as the very greatest of
the peculiarities which, in my opinion, entitle this school to be warmly
welcomed among us. They are the first persons in the Church of England
who for more than a century past have conscientiously and rigidly
endeavoured to live up to what they nominally profess—to obey the
regulations of that church of which they call themselves members. Even
Philo-Puseyite speaks of their “predilection for ceremonies, and
vestments, and fastings, and vigils, and saints’ days,” as something
“revolting.”7 But is it forgotten that these things are actual
ordinances of the Church of England, and that the Puseyites are simply
acting out the written code of their religion? If these things are
absurdities, with whom lies the fault? They were not placed in the
Rubric8 by the Puseyites. The charge of insincerity brought against this
party for remaining in the church without assenting, or while assenting
only in a latitudinarian sense, to the articles, may be much more fairly
retorted upon those who, without considering, as the Puseyites do,
adherence to the church to be the paramount duty of a Christian,
nevertheless remain in it with a tacit reservation that they are to
conform to just as many of its rules and authoritative precepts as to
them appear reasonable. Let the opposite party, then, bestir themselves
to cause such of the ceremonies, and such of the religious exercises
prescribed by the church as they disapprove of, to be abrogated in the
lawful manner, by canonical authority. But until this is done, I confess
I honour Edition: current; Page: [815] far more those who act up to what
is professed by all, than those who take one part of it and leave
another, as suits themselves.

It is not, sir, by continuing to profess opinions, and silently
forbearing to act upon them, that either religious or any other
prevailing doctrines are to be freed from whatever of irrational or
pernicious they may contain. It is too true that this is the ordinary
course of changes of opinion. It is a disgusting, but sometimes
inevitable era of transition between the pristine vigour and final
downfall of creeds or doctrines, originally too deeply rooted in the
soil to admit of being eradicated unless they have first reached an
advanced stage of corruption and decomposition. In religion, and also in
politics, the whole eighteenth century was a period of this kind. But
that is a happy day for renovated humanity, when first a sincere man,
indignant at the more and more complete severance of profession from
practice, stands up as a fulfiller, in his own person, and a vindicator
to the world, of the solemn duty of doing the whole of that which he
daily professes that he ought to do. By carrying out this principle, and
even because he carries it out to its last and absurdest consequences,
he challenges and compels inquiry into the grounds of the belief itself,
and the degree in which it is or is not still adapted to be the rule of
conduct for humanity in its altered state; and by the very vigour with
which he asserts the false parts of his own creed, he, by a reaction as
certain as it is salutary, calls forth into corresponding activity and
energy those opposite truths, in the minds of other people, which are
the suitable means of expelling the false opinions without prejudice to
the just views with which they are always, but not inseparably,
interwoven: thus giving to the world over again that without which its
whole scheme would be an abortion and a failure—notions of duty made to
be executed, not to be locked up as too good for use, or worn for
outside show.

I must not, sir, encroach further on your space; but if you should deem
this letter worthy of insertion, I may perhaps return to the subject,
and lay before you in a more particular manner the grounds on which I
contend that Puseyism is one of the most important and interesting
phenomena which has appeared above the horizon of English speculation
for many years past.

292.: PUSEYISM [2]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 13 JAN., 1842, P. 3

For the background and the entry in Mill’s bibliography, see No. 291.
This letter is headed “Puseyism.—Letter II,” with the subhead, “To the
Editor of the Morning Chronicle.”

sir,—

Let me begin by thanking you for your prompt insertion of my former
communication, and not less sincerely for the comments in a subsequent
editorial Edition: current; Page: [816] article, which in temper and
candour were all that could be desired, and in substantials quite as
favourable as I had reason to expect.1 I never did so much injustice to
the writer of the denunciations of Puseyism which have so often appeared
in your paper, as to imagine that he would have thus written with
opinions of the subject so weak as to be shaken by the first breath of
controversy. You have said what there is to be said for your view of the
question, and it is satisfactory to find that there is so little. I
cannot say that I perceive in it anything new, or which, as you seem to
surmise, I had previously overlooked. The topics are such as no one
could overlook, who attempted to anticipate what you would say. How, for
example, after charging with hypocrisy, for not seceding from the
church, men who hold that to secede from her would be to renounce their
baptism, could you possibly defend yourself without drawing the
distinction, and making as much of it as you could, between remaining in
the communion of the church and partaking of its emoluments? The point
could not be missed: a nisi prius advocate of the lowest grade could not
have failed to take advantage of it.

I with, sir, that it were as easy to exculpate the Puseyites, or
Newmanites (as I admit that they may be more properly called) from every
other of the accusations brought against them, as it is from this, of
dishonestly retaining a state fee of which they violate the conditions.
You would scarcely continue to bring this charge if you had sufficiently
considered what it implies, or how widely the theory of the relation
between spiritual teachers and temporal governors, which you seem to
hold, differs both from that of the Newmanites themselves, and from the
doctrines of the most enlightened friends of liberty in the present and
in past ages.

It would be a sufficient vindication of this party against the
imputation of dishonesty, to show that their conduct is strictly
consistent with their own principles; especially when those principles
are not theirs peculiarly, but common to them with the great body of
churchmen, or at least with the principal defenders of the Church of
England as a political establishment. By what right do you require the
Newmanites to make themselves martyrs for opinions which are not theirs;
to acknowledge as a truth, by recognizing as obligatory upon them in
practice, the doctrine that the endowments of the Church of England are
a state fee given as a consideration for teaching certain religious
tenets? Do they hold this doctrine? Is there any party in the church
worth mentioning which holds it? Will they not answer, and will not the
whole Conservative body answer with them, that the endowments, the far
greater part of them at least, did not come from the state, never
belonged to the state at all, but to private individuals who voluntarily
gave them to the church, for purposes and under expectations, which it
is the very crime charged against the Puseyites, that they far more
nearly fulfil than the party of the Protestants par excellence think it
right to do? Some kings Edition: current; Page: [817] did, it is true,
give lands from their hereditary domain, and the state, as a state, did
render compulsory the payment of tithe,2 not however until the majority
of landed proprietors throughout Christian Europe had, from religious
motives, consented to take the payment upon themselves; and, at all
events, when once given, it was, according to the doctrine of all
Conservative, and of many liberal writers, given irrevocably; it became
as the land itself became in the hands of its feudal holders, not a
salary, but a property.

The Puseyites do not, and, consistently with their religious doctrines,
cannot acknowledge that the state made the Church of England, or gave it
the property it holds, or did or could annex to that property any new
conditions imposed by itself. Its power, in their view, like that of any
judicial tribunal, extends only to enforcing the conditions on which the
property is really held, which, according to them, are simply and solely
those of being in communion with the Church Catholic, and having
received ordination from a bishop to whom the power of conferring it has
descended by uninterrupted succession from the Apostles. They do not,
indeed, deny that the state, in the person of the tyrant Henry VIII, did
assert another sort of power over these endowments, and did nefariously
abuse that power by seizing a full half of the church property for the
use of the monarch himself and of his favourites.3 But is any one bound
to resign what is his own, because somebody who is stronger chooses to
assert a claim to it which he does not and cannot substantiate, and to
pretend that it is only held on sufferance from him? If the Church of
England has ever admitted that it is a national church by virtue of the
King’s appointment, that the Crown made it, or had anything to do with
the matter but to recognize it as the portion of the church of Christ
existing in this nation, there would be something to be said against the
Newmanites. But this they deny. The mere acknowledgment of the King as
head of the church, that is, as what the Pope, according to the best
Catholic tradition, was before, the mere executive (the supreme
authority being in the body itself), does not, in their view, nor in the
view of many persons besides them, constitute such an admission.

I am not stating these as my own arguments. I do not concur in them.
They are deduced from the principles of a religious and political creed
which is not mine. But it is the creed of the Puseyites. They stand upon
their right to the endowments. On their own premises they are justified
in making this stand. And when men are accused of insincerity, it is by
their own premises that they are entitled to be tried. I confess,
however, that I should not feel the same interest in their cause if
there were nothing concerned in it but their own honesty and
consistency; if it did not appear to me to involve a great principle,
which it is not necessary to be a Newmanite, or even a churchman to
acknowledge, and which it Edition: current; Page: [818] more especially
becomes those who call themselves Liberals to take every occasion of
asserting and vindicating.

The endowments, which the Puseyites say are not derived from the state,
I say are derived from it.4 I deny the inviolability of foundations, and
not only claim it as a right, but affirm it as a duty, of the
Legislature to alter the appropriation of all such as, after due
deliberation, with due precaution against its own fallibility, it deems
to be no longer beneficially employed. I therefore hold that the state
can rightfully take away the endowments of the Church of England, as
many good and wise men have held that it ought to do; that it has a
right to determine whether it will endow with this property, any body of
religious teachers whatever, and if it does, has a right to select the
body which it judges best qualified for that high function. Its power,
therefore, of giving the endowments for the purpose of spiritual
teaching, is absolute; but that it has a right to give them
conditionally, the condition being that of teaching certain doctrines,
and those only, I deny. It must bestow them for teaching what the
teachers believe, not what itself believes. It is not to chuse
doctrines, but instructors. If there is to be an endowed church at all,
there must be a power in the legislature to judge what is the body which
shall be recognised in that character. But this is the same thing with
determining the doctrines that shall be taught. Is that work for a
King’s ministers and two Houses of Parliament? Are they the theologians
from whom those who listen to the publicly accredited religious
instructors are to take their religion? Have we rejected popes and
councils to receive our doctrines from a pope in St. James’s, or a
council in St. Stephen’s?5 The state has a different duty to perform. It
is to judge, not what is taught, but the title to teach. The Newmanites
say that they, or rather the church to which they adhere, are the
teachers, divinely commissioned, and have credentials from the Almighty,
pointing them out as such: if so, let the state look to the credentials,
and judge of them. If nobody can make out a title by appointment from
above, those are entitled who can give best proof of having qualified
themselves by the fitting studies and the fitting moral discipline. It
is for the state to decide this. It is for the state to determine what
communion or what body of persons is most fitted, in point of general
competency, to put a right interpretation upon Christianity, and to
bring its practical principles home to the national mind. But when we
are told that the state has ordained certain religious tenets to be
taught, and a certain interpretation to be put upon Christianity, under
the penalty of not teaching under state authority at all, I can only
answer that whether by the state are to be understood a dead Henry VIII,
or a living Peel or Melbourne, they have no credentials for this trust,
can show no qualifications for it. Their duty is to find Edition:
current; Page: [819] who are, or ought to be, the national church; it is
the church’s duty to determine what the church ought to teach.

I am tempted, sir, as one who has for many years considered himself a
Liberal, to ask what is become of several doctrines which were once
considered the distinguishing principles of the extreme Liberal party.
Among the rest we used, I remember, in former days, to profess much
disapprobation of what was called a connection between church and state.
Perhaps some of those who reproach the Puseyites for objecting to state
interference with the church, could refresh my memory as to what we
meant by this. I wonder if it was merely the acres, or the pounds
sterling, which we wanted to rescue from the church, and convert to our
own uses; or whether we thought that there was nothing so certain to
corrupt religious teaching, as the interference with it of temporal
governors; that such persons when they meddle with prescribing religious
doctrines, seldom do it for any good, and that the sole effect of making
the church dependent on the state, is to make religion an instrument for
upholding temporal despotism, and an ally of every abuse which the
indolence of rulers suffers, or by which their cupidity profits. And has
not such been, in fact, the history of every church which has held its
commission from the state, or been dependent upon it? Of the Greek
church, both at Constantinople and at Petersburgh? Of the Church of
England, and most Protestant churches, from their very commencement? And
even the Church of Rome, to which, corrupt and effete as it now is,
humanity owes a debt never to be sufficiently appreciated, is not it
chargeable with the same sin, from the time when that glorious struggle
for which a Hildebrand lived and a Becket died—heroes who will eternally
survive by the side of Martin Luther and John Knox—was shamefully wound
up by the memorable blow inflicted upon Boniface VIII at Anagni, by the
emissary of Philippe le Bel—which established for all the centuries
which have since elapsed the supremacy of the sceptre over the crosier,
and of which it was but a natural consequence that a few years after,
the pontiff of the Christian world sat at Avignon, for the first time in
history, as the degraded tool of a temporal oppressor, sanctioning the
butchery of the Templars and every other enormity of that rapacious
despot?6

Against this idea of a church establishment, the Newmanites protest, and
I Edition: current; Page: [820] protest with them. If an established
church is not to be independent of state control, no established church
ought to exist. A church bound to teach only what the state commands!
Why, it is the business of a church to be a schoolmaster to the state,
and a bridle or a spur to it—the one or the other, or both, according as
it needs them. It is the business of a church to fill the minds of the
people with ideas and feelings of duty by which the temporal rulers
shall be restrained, and of which they shall stand in awe. If these
rulers, to be a check upon whom is one of the chief uses of an organised
body of religious teachers, are to prescribe to that body what it shall
teach, can we expect anything but what has generally existed in the
Church of England, a tacit understanding that the peace is to be kept on
all points which would really stir up people’s minds, and on all matters
of religion or morality which concern the higher classes of society in
their duties as governors; that so much of Christianity shall alone be
insisted upon as is good for the lower orders, and that the church shall
exist, in the words of a clever and eloquent writer, only for the
purpose of

-   

    . . . Discreetly teaching all to choose,
-   

    The path their betters fain would have them use?*

Most heartily is it to be rejoiced at, that a party has arisen which
asserts a higher position than this for the religious teachers of a
nation, and with whose convictions it is consistent, while claiming this
higher character for the church, to remain in the church—to assert these
as her principles, not those of her enemies; and to revive the
remembrance of the claims which the Christian church once made to a more
exalted destination, and of the services which she rendered in the
fulfilment of it. I care not in what manner they reconcile this to their
consciences, so that they do reconcile it. The principles by which they
do so are those which they profess in common with almost every defender
of the establishment; but were it otherwise—were it true that they
silence their scruples by the most flimsy sophistry—it is not for us,
who hold the same conclusions on firmer grounds, to meet them with
reproach or discouragement.

The remaining part, sir, of your reply to my letter is chiefly employed
in contending that the motives of these men are not so pure from mere
worldly ambition, as, taking a rational view of their situation and
prospects, I had concluded them to be. Your proofs of this are, that
they are eager to propagate their opinions, to get newspapers, and
reviews, and the younger clergy on their side, which you seem to think a
very unpardonable stretch of priestly assumption; and that they have
been, as you represent, very successful in these objects, although
judging from present appearances their success even in their stronghold,
Oxford, does not amount to any very substantial ascendancy. If the
Edition: current; Page: [821] clergy and even the monkery of their own
university will not consent, and it seems far from likely that they
will, to raise one of this body to the dignity of a Poetry Professor and
a salary of £100 a year,7 one would not give much for their chance of
deaneries or mitres from the practical statesmen of the Conservative
party, for whom, in fact, and for whose principles of action, instead of
practising any sycophancy, they scarcely disguise their contempt. But
suppose them to have been ten times more successful, what argument is
this against them, any more than against Luther, or Wesley, or any other
leader of a great religious movement? Grant them any degree of possible
success, and they gain only a dim and distant prospect of what they
would have been sure of by very ordinary exertion in the common road of
preferment. You talk of the movement as having originated in a meeting
held at the house of the Archbishop of Canterbury’s chaplain, to consult
about what should be done to protect the church against the
encroachments of the Whig ministry. I am surprised that you should
attach any importance to such an old nurse’s tale.8 Is a profound and
connected system of thought, embracing not only a complete body of
theology and philosophy, but a consistent theory of universal history, a
thing which can be got up suddenly in a year, or two years, for a
momentary political exigency? That there may be persons in high places,
both in and out of the clerical body, who have joined or countenanced
this movement from such motives as you allege, is likely enough; every
cause has its share of this sort of proselytes; and there very probably
was such a meeting as you state: but that the set of doctrines called
Puseyism originated from thence, it would take no ordinary portion of
credulity to make any person believe. The circumstances of the times may
have awakened serious thoughts in minds which otherwise would have
slumbered; the dangers which menaced the institutions they most valued
may have helped to lead even such men as Mr. Newman and Dr. Pusey to
reflect more deeply than they otherwise would have done upon the spirit
and original purposes of those institutions. But this dependence of our
deepest and most conscientious thoughts upon the suggestions of our
outward circumstances, is incident to the infirmity of our speculative
faculties, and is no imputation upon the sincerity of any one, nor, to
Edition: current; Page: [822] any great extent, even upon the strength
of his judgment. If it be a reproach, it is one to which all mankind are
liable.

But I must not encroach farther, and really I do not know what I could
add, or in what way the vindication of any set of men could be more
complete. On their doctrines, as distinguished from the characters of
the men themselves, and on the position which they seem to me to hold in
English speculation, I could say much on a future occasion, if you
continue to do me the honour of inserting my letters.9

Historicus


293.: REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE LABOURING POPULATION OF GREAT BRITAIN
 EXAMINER, 20 AUG., 1842, PP. 530-1

On 8 June, 1842, Mill had written to his friend Edwin Chadwick about the
“Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great
Britain,” to be printed in House of Lords Sessional Papers, 1842, XXVI
(published separately by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office in the same
year): “I have read the whole report carefully through again. The
defects of arrangements are now corrected & I have nothing to suggest
except that it be carefully revised by yourself or some other person to
correct the numerous typographical errors & occasional ungrammatical
sentences. I think it all excellent & shall be glad to write about it
for any newspaper as you suggest.” (EL, CW, Vol. XIII, pp. 523-4.) The
review, headed as title, appeared in the “Political Examiner.” It is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “The greater part of an article on
Chadwick’s ‘Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population
in Great Britain’ in the Examiner of 20th August 1842” (MacMinn, p. 54).
It is not known which part of the review is not by Mill, nor who added
it, though Fonblanque normally wrote most of each issue.

this report, prepared by Mr. Chadwick from the results of inquiries made
in all parts of England, Wales, and Scotland, by himself and others,
under the Poor Law Commission,1 is destined, if we mistake not, to make
an impression on the public mind more extensive and permanent even than
that recently produced by the appalling disclosures of the Children’s
Employment Commission.2 It is long since we have read any document so
painful in respect to the past and present, or so encouraging in regard
to the future. The occasion is a fitting one for a remark Edition:
current; Page: [823] similar to that of Demosthenes to the Athenians,
that what is worst in retrospect is sometimes best in prospect.3 If the
mass of disgusting misery depicted in this Report had been found to
exist after all which human wisdom could devise had been done to avert
it, things would indeed be hopeless. But since the evils are so great
only because it has been nobody’s appointed duty to stir a finger for
their alleviation; because legislators and administrators have thought
they did enough for the poor by leaving them to themselves; and even
private philanthropy, except in the case of a very few noble-hearted
landlords and manufacturers, has taken any other direction rather than
this; the spectacle of so vast a field of human improvement altogether
untrodden, or imprinted only by the feet of a few thinly scattered
pioneers, suggests the most cheering prospects of an amount of physical,
moral, and social amelioration, not only practicable, but easily and
rapidly to be accomplished, such as the most sanguine would hardly have
dared, without the superabundant evidence contained in this Report, to
indulge even in imagination.

A conception of the extent of the field comprehended in the Report may
most easily be given by an enumeration of the titles under which it is
arranged [pp. xxiii-xxix]:

I. General condition of the residences of the labouring classes where
disease is found to be the most prevalent.

II. Public arrangements, external to the residences, by which the
sanitary condition of the labouring population is affected.

Subdivided under the following heads:

Town drainage of streets and houses.

Street and road cleansing: road pavements.

Supplies of water.

Sanitary effect of land drainage.

III. Circumstances chiefly in the internal economy and bad ventilation
of places of work; workmen’s lodging-houses, dwellings, and the domestic
habits affecting the health of the labouring classes.

IV. Comparative chances of life in different classes of the community.

V. Pecuniary burdens created by the neglect of sanitary measures.

VI. Evidence of the effects of preventive measures in raising the
standard of health, and the chances of life.

With the following sub-heads:

Cost to tenants and owners, of the public measures for drainage,
cleansing, and the supplies of water, as compared with the cost of
sickness.

Employers’ influence on the health of work-people by means of improved
habitations.

Edition: current; Page: [824]
Employers’ influence on the sobriety and health of work-people by modes
of payment, which do not lead to temptations to intemperance.

Employers’ influence on the health of work-people by the promotion of
personal cleanliness.

Employers’ influence on the health of work-people by the ventilation of
places of work, and the prevention of noxious fumes, dust, &c.

Employers’ means of influencing the condition of the working population,
by regard to respectability in dress.

Employers’ or owners’ influence in the improvement of habitations and
sanitary arrangements for the protection of the labouring classes in the
rural districts.

Effects of public walks and gardens on the health and morals of the
lower classes of the population.

VII. Recognised principles of legislation and state of the existing law
for the protection of the public health.

Under this head the Report has little to do except to demonstrate the
total inefficiency of all the administrative arrangements at present
applicable to the various purposes referred to in the preceding part of
the Report, and the impossibility of making any real provision for those
purposes without reconstructing the arrangements upon more rational and
comprehensive principles than have yet been seen by those who have
hitherto undertaken to legislate on the subject.

VIII, and last. Common lodging houses.

After two most careful and deliberate perusals of this important
document, we need not fear to express the opinion, that under each and
every one of the leading divisions of the Report, the intelligent
reader, who has no previous acquaintance with the subject, will find his
utmost imagination exceeded, both by the extent and magnitude of the
existing evils, and by the amount of good which not only may be, as a
matter of inference and speculation, but has been, in occasional
instances, actually accomplished, and that too by the employment of the
simplest and most obvious means.

We are accustomed to value ourselves upon our superiority to the nations
of the continent in the airiness, cleanliness, and neatness of our
towns. We deserve this praise as to the quarters, or at least the
thoroughfares, inhabited by persons in the higher and middle ranks of
life, but those classes are entirely unaware that the quarters
exclusively inhabited by the labouring people, and even the lanes and
alleys abutting on the backs of their own mansions, are too often in a
condition which the most noisome and pestilential parts of the worst
continental towns can scarcely exceed, and this by no means exclusively
in large manufacturing but in small country towns, and even villages,
and not from poverty, but from bad drainage, a mode of building which
excludes ventilation, and lastly, insufficient supplies of water;
defects which, as the Report shows, might be completely Edition:
current; Page: [825] remedied at a trifling cost, compared even with the
mere expense of maintaining the sick and orphan poor who are made such
by these deleterious agencies.

Mr. Chadwick states in his concluding summary of the points which he
considers established, and it is difficult to read the evidence which he
adduces and not agree with him,

That the annual loss of life from filth and bad ventilation is greater
than the loss from death or wounds in any wars in which the country has
been engaged in modern times:

That of the 43,000 cases of widowhood and 112,000 cases of destitute
orphanage relieved from the poor rates in England and Wales alone, it
appears that the greatest proportion of deaths of the heads of families
occurred from the above-specified and other removable causes; that their
ages were under 45 years; that is to say, 13 years below the natural
probabilities of life, as shown by the experience of the whole
population of Sweden:

That measuring the loss of working ability amongst large classes by the
instances of gain, even from incomplete arrangements for the removal of
noxious influences from places of work or from abodes, this loss cannot
be less than eight or ten years.

[Pp. 369-70.]

The following is a most important and unexpected result: and most fully
is it established:

That the ravages of epidemics and other diseases do not diminish, but
tend to increase the pressure of population:

That in the districts where the mortality is greatest the births are not
only sufficient to replace the numbers removed by death, but to add to
the population.

[P. 370.]

Amongst the structural arrangements, of the practicability of which
evidence is given, will be found the testimony of practical engineers on
such points as the following:

That the chief obstacles to the immediate removal of decomposing refuse
of towns and habitations have been the expense and annoyance of the hand
labour and cartage requisite for the purpose.

That this expense may be reduced to one-twentieth or to one-thirtieth,
or rendered inconsiderable, by the use of water and self-acting means of
removal by improved and cheaper sewers and drains.

That refuse, when thus held in suspension in water, may be most cheaply
and innoxiously conveyed to any distance out of towns, and also in the
best form for productive use, and that the loss and injury by the
pollution of natural streams may be avoided.

That by appropriate arrangements, 10 or 15 per cent. on the ordinary
outlay for drainage might be saved, which, on an estimate of the expense
of the necessary structural alterations of one-third only of the
existing tenements, would be a saving of one million and a half
sterling, besides the reduction of the future expenses of management.

That the expense of public drainage, of supplies of water laid on in
houses, and of means of improved cleansing, would be a pecuniary gain,
by diminishing the existing charges attendant on sickness and premature
mortality.

[P. 371.]

The following general observations are made on this topic:

Edition: current; Page: [826]
The condition of large rural districts in the immediate vicinity of the
towns, and of the poorest districts of the towns themselves, presents a
singular contrast in the nature of the agencies by which the health of
the inhabitants is impaired. Within the towns we find the houses and
streets filthy, the air foetid, disease, typhus, and other epidemics
rife amongst the population, bringing, in the train, destitution and the
need of pecuniary as well as medical relief; all mainly arising from the
presence of the richest materials of production, the complete absence of
which would, in a great measure, restore health, avert the recurrence of
disease, and, if properly applied, would promote abundance, cheapen
food, and increase the demand for beneficial labour. Outside the
afflicted districts, and at a short distance from them, as in the
adjacent rural districts, we find the aspect of the country poor and
thinly clad with vegetation, except rushes and plants favoured by a
superabundance of moisture, the crops meagre, the labouring agricultural
population few, and afflicted with rheumatism and other maladies,
arising from damp and an excess of water, which, if removed, would
relieve them from a cause of disease, the land from an impediment to
production, and if conveyed for the use of the town population, would
give that population the element of which they stand in peculiar need,
as a means to relieve them from that which is their own cause of
depression, and return it for use on the land as a means of the highest
fertility.

[P. 97.]

To afford a conception of the need of care in this respect to provide
for the increase of population, it is stated that the rate of that
increase, 230,000 per annum, is equivalent to the annual addition of a
new county, requiring about 60,000 new houses every year to accommodate
them—an increase in houses equivalent to two new towns nearly as large
as Manchester proper, which has 32,310 houses, and Leeds, which has
27,268 houses.

It may be of interest to observe that, as the whole population grows in
age, the annual increase in numbers may be deemed to be equivalent to an
annual increase of numbers of the average ages of the community. If they
were maintained on the existing average of territory to the population
in England, the additional numbers would require an annual extension of
one fifty-seventh of the present territory of Great Britain, possessing
the average extent of roads, commons, hills, and unproductive land. The
extent of new territory required annually would form a county larger
than Surrey, or Leicester, or Nottingham, or Hereford, or Cambridge, and
nearly as large as Warwick. To feed the annually increased population,
supposing it to consume the same proportions of meat that is consumed by
the population of Manchester and its vicinity (a consumption which
appears to me to be below the average of the consumption in the
metropolis), the influx of 230,000 of new population will require for
their consumption an annual increase of 27,327 head of cattle, 70,319
sheep, 64,715 lambs, and 7,894 calves, to raise which an annual increase
of upwards of 81,000 acres of good pasture land would be required.
Taking the consumption of wheat or bread to be on the scale of a common
dietary, i.e., 56 oz. daily for a family of a man, woman, and three
children, then the annual addition of the supply of wheat required will
be about 105,000 quarters, requiring 28,058 acres of land, yielding 30
bushels of wheat to an acre; the total amount of good land requisite for
raising the chief articles of food will therefore be in all about
109,000 acres of good pasture land annually. If the increase of
production obtained by the use of the refuse of Edinburgh (that is, of
3,900 oxen from one quarter of the refuse of Edinburgh) be taken as the
scale of production obtainable by appropriate measures, the refuse of
the metropolis alone that is now thrown away would serve to feed no less
than 218,288 oxen annually, which would be equivalent to the produce of
double that number of acres of good pasture land.

[Pp. 330-1.]

Edition: current; Page: [827]
There is no one thing more completely made out in the Report, from
incontestable statistical evidence, than that the mortality occasioned
among adults by vice and misery does not check, but rather stimulates,
the undue increase of numbers. Its principal effect consists in merely
substituting a young, and, at the same time, weakly population, for one
fairly proportioned among the seven ages of man.4 Precisely in those
places where, by accurate records, it is known that deaths are fewest,
and the average duration of life longest, there also occurs the smallest
annual number of births; and as improvement occurs in the one respect,
its consequences are more and more felt in the other.

Such evidence as the following is adduced of hope for the future:

In illustration of the moral and social effects to be anticipated from
measures for the removal of the causes of pestilence amongst the
labouring classes, and for the increase of their duration of life,
concurrently with an increase of the population, I refer to the effect
experienced in Geneva from the like improvements effected during the
lapse of centuries. That city is, so far as I am aware, the only one in
Europe in which there is an early and complete set of registers of
marriages, births, and deaths. These registries were established in the
year 1549, and are viewed as preappointed evidences5 to civil rights,
and are kept with great care. This registration includes the name of the
disease which has caused the death, entered by a district physician who
is charged by the State with the inspection of every person who dies
within his district. A second table is made up from certificates setting
forth the nature of the disease, with a specification of the symptoms,
and observations required to be made by the private physician who may
have had the care of the deceased. These registries have been the
subject of frequent careful examinations. It appears from them that the
progress of the population intra muros of that city has been as follows:

6Chadwick takes the table from _Recherches historiques et statistiques
sur la population de Genève_ (Paris: Renouard, 1837), p. 12, by Edouard
Mallet (1805-56).

It is proved in a report by M. Edward Mallet, one of the most able that
have been made from these registries, that this increase of the
population has been followed by an increase in the probable duration of
life in that city:

The progression of the population and the increased duration of life had
been attended by a progression in happiness: as prosperity advanced
marriages became fewer and later;* the proportion of births were
reduced, but greater numbers of the infants born were preserved;† and
the proportion of the population in manhood became greater.8 In the
early and barbarous periods, the excessive mortality was accompanied by
a prodigious fecundity. In the ten last years of the 17th century, a
marriage still produced five children and more; the probable duration of
life attained was not twenty years, and Geneva had Edition: current;
Page: [829] scarcely 17,000 inhabitants. Towards the end of the 18th
century there were scarcely three children to a marriage, and the
probabilities of life exceeded 32 years. At the present time a marriage
only produces 2 3/4 children; the probability of life is 45 years, and
Geneva, which exceeds 27,000 in population, has arrived at a high degree
of civilization and of “prospérité matérielle.”9 In 1836 the population
appeared to have attained its summit; the births barely replaced the
deaths.

M. Mallet observes, that it is difficult, if not impossible, to
distinguish the different causes, and the different degrees of intensity
of each of the causes, that have tended to produce this result.10 It is,
however, attributed generally to the advance in the condition of all
classes; to the medical science of the public health being better
understood and applied; to larger and better and cleaner dwellings; more
abundant and healthy food; the cessation of the great epidemics which,
from time to time, decimated the population; the precautions taken
against famine; and better regulated public and private life. As an
instance of the effects of regimen in the preservation of life, he
mentions that, in an establishment for the care of female orphans taken
from the poorest classes, out of 86 reared in 24 years, one only had
died.11 These orphans were taken from the poor. The average mortality on
the whole population would have been six times as great.

[Pp. 174-6.]

We would willing touch at greater length upon many of the important
topics in the Report, but we have only space remaining for one.

The attention of philanthropists has of late begun to turn itself to the
improvement of the imputed evils of the Factory System, and many have
sincerely adopted the opinion (which has, moreover, been sedulously
propagated by those who thought themselves interested in maintaining the
Corn Laws) that to work in factories at all is inconsistent with a
healthy condition, either physical or moral, of the labouring classes of
any community. The Children’s Employment Commission has already done
much to dissipate the error of supposing that human beings who work in
large bodies, and under the protection, more or less perfect, of
publicity, are worse taken care of, or more unfavourably circumstanced
in any respect, than those who perform work of an analogous description
in places called by other names. The present document shows, by the most
copious evidence, that factories, even as they are now, are much
surpassed in unhealthiness, and in all the demoralizing consequences
shown to result from unhealthiness, by other places of work not called
factories, such as those of the tailors in London, and by the private
dwellings of a large part of the labouring population. That,
nevertheless, the existing factories are, speaking generally, extremely
unhealthy; but that they are so only for want of proper ventilation and
other important requisites, which, if the enlightened self-interest of
the owners fail to supply, the law could and ought to enforce; and that
in all instances in which, either from that enlightened self-interest or
from benevolence, such Edition: current; Page: [830] improved
arrangements have been carried into effect, and especially where the
improvement of the private dwelling-places of the work-people has been
included in the plan, its authors have been rewarded by seeing around
them a healthy, thriving, and well-conducted factory population attached
to them, and having none of the evil characteristics so often declared
to be inseparable from the Factory System.

Our limits compel us to quit the subject of this Report before we have
given an idea of a tithe of its important contents. But no such notice
as we could give would do it justice. The Report itself, or a full
abstract, should be in the hands of every legislator or administrator,
every philanthropist, and every employer of labour in the community.


294.: LORD ASHBURTON’S TREATY
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 4 OCT., 1842, P. 3

The warlike attitude of British Liberals towards the United States, of
which Mill complains in this letter, had arisen over such matters as the
right to search slave-ships. It had been inflamed in November 1840 by
the capture, and subsequent indictment for murder, of Alexander McLeod
(1796-1871), a Canadian who boasted of seizing the U.S.S. Caroline and
murdering a crew member when the ship was engaged in an attempt by
rebels and adventurers to capture Navy Island from the Canadians. McLeod
was acquitted in 1841, and an exchange of notes in August 1842 lessened
the tension. At the same time, the Canadian-American border dispute
going back to the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 was resolved by
negotiating teams led by Alexander Baring, Lord Ashburton, for Britain,
and Daniel Webster (1782-1852) for the United States. The result was the
“Treaty between Her Majesty and the United States of America” (9 Aug.,
1842), PP, 1843, LXI, 1-8, known as the Webster-Ashburton Treaty.
Palmerston, the former Foreign Secretary, had vigorously attacked the
concessive policy of Peel, as manifested in the Treaty, and was reputed
to be the author of the critical articles in the Morning Chronicle that
had appeared almost daily from 19 Sept. to 3 Oct. Mill’s letter, headed
“To the Editor of the Morning Chronicle,” was answered on the day of its
publication by an article on p. 2 of the Chronicle. The letter is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “A letter signed A on Lord
Ashburton’s Treaty with America, in the Morning Chronicle of 4th October
1842”

(MacMinn, p. 55).

sir,—

As an old admirer of your paper, and an ancient adherent of that Liberal
party, one of whose chief distinctions I have always understood to be
that it was the party of peace; which, indeed, one can ill imagine how a
party carrying the banner of advancing intelligence and progressive
improvement, could fail to be; give me leave to solicit some explanation
from you on the new character in which, on all matters affecting foreign
policy and national differences, it has of late been the pleasure of
some of the leaders of that party to manifest themselves, and of some of
its organs, yourself in particular, as the most potent of them, to aid
and abet that manifestation.

Edition: current; Page: [831]
Until within these few years, it was not only the doctrine of the
Liberal party, but a sort of commonplace among writers in general, that
war is the game of kings,1 not the pleasure of their subjects. We were
accustomed to contend, that in proportion as the affairs of nations were
withdrawn from the control of individual ambition, vanity, or animosity,
and placed under the power of those who pay the taxes and smart by the
commercial losses which war engenders, in the same proportion would that
ancient and barbarous mode of terminating the disputes between
governments fall into disuse. For some years past, however, that which
has called itself the popular party in each of the three most powerful
countries of the earth—England, America, and France—has, whether in or
out of power, been sedulously engaged in blowing up war between those
countries, if not by direct instigation, yet by that blustering tone and
that bitter and insulting language, which are much more likely
provocatives of quarrel than even real injuries; and now, it seems, this
course is to be persevered in; as in France, so here the Liberal party,
if some who seek to be its leaders are suffered to have their way, will
stand openly before mankind in the disgraceful character of a war party,
and will labour to discredit and frustrate the apparently sincere and
hitherto successful exertions of the governments of the three countries
to keep the world at peace;—an attempt of which you, sir, are making
yourself in our own country, the main instrument, but in which I trust
you are destined to be speedily, signally, and shamefully defeated.

The complaint which I make extends to the principles and tone of nearly
every article on foreign policy which has appeared in your paper for the
last three years, and I select as the most recent, and one of the most
striking examples, your strictures on the late treaty with America.

Although it may suit party politicians to have short memories, I imagine
most of your readers can carry back their recollection to the state of
public feeling respecting our relations with the United States; for many
months previous to the commencement of Lord Ashburton’s mission, public
opinion, which is usually in excess either on the side of security or of
apprehension, then inclined strongly in the direction of alarm. It was
generally thought that feelings naturally tending to hostility between
the two countries, were progressively and dangerously on the increase.
Many did not hesitate to affirm, some to affirm publicly, that war, even
if now averted, was yet, in no very long period, inevitable: while there
were none who did not feel that dispositions existed on the other side
of the Atlantic, and were, to all appearance, very likely to be excited
on this, which would eagerly lay hold of any pretence for quarrel. Above
all, it was feared, that so long as the boundary question remained open,
acts of aggression on one or the other side, were every year more likely
to take place, which might force the two Edition: current; Page: [832]
governments into war in spite of themselves: because, however
unauthorised by them the provocations might be, it might not be possible
for them to extricate themselves from the responsibility except by acts
of atonement more humiliating to national vanity than in the present low
average of human virtue the public opinion of their respective countries
would permit them to make. It is hazarding little to assert that to this
extent the generality of sober and sensible people in our own country
did feel uneasiness; and that a war of this description, unintended by
the two governments or nations, but in which they might insensibly and
almost unconsciously become involved by the mere natural progress of the
boundary dispute, was the only one of which such people thought there
was any real danger. And certainly this belief is not proved to have
been ill-grounded, because it may happen that public opinion has since
gone round to the opposite quarter, and changed from exaggerated alarm
to an indolent forgetfulness that there ever was any ground for
apprehension at all.

With this sense of the importance of removing, while it could still be
done, all stumbling blocks to good understanding between the two
nations, and especially the greatest stumbling block, the boundary
dispute, most persons, I believe, saw with pleasure the appointment of a
special envoy to the United States. It indicated that an attempt was
about to be made in earnest to settle these differences. It proved that
Sir R. Peel’s policy on the question was to be pacific.2 And I do not
think I am mistaken in affirming that Lord Ashburton was generally
deemed to have been wisely selected for this purpose, precisely because
of those family ties and former commercial relations which connected his
interests and his sympathies with the welfare of America as well as of
England. It was felt that the regular diplomatists of the ministerial
party with their Tory and anti-American prejudices had been put aside,
and that a man had been chosen of whom, more than of almost any other
who would have been considered eligible, it might be certain that he had
no such prejudices. I believe this circumstance to have been the cause
of the decrease of public apprehension, which almost instantly
manifested itself on the announcement of Lord Ashburton’s appointment.
The choice was approved, not because it was thought that he would not,
but that he would, make peace. It was felt that he was a man who would
take a practical, rather than a pedantic, view of the matters in issue,
and who would be less likely than most men to hold out for the summum
jus where it would have the effect of summa injuria.3 However this may
be, there was no mistaking the indications of general belief that Lord
Ashburton, if any one, was the man to settle this question; and of a
general hope that he would settle it, mixed, indeed, with considerable
doubt of the practicability, but accompanied by an evident Edition:
current; Page: [833] disposition to call both him and the government
which employed him to a severe account if, being able to settle it in
any manner not disgraceful, they failed to do so.

And now, let me ask, in what manner was it expected, or desired, that
Lord Ashburton should apply himself to effecting this settlement?

Was it by announcing the peremptory resolution of Great Britain to make
no concessions, but to insist upon receiving the whole of what, upon her
own showing, she was entitled to? Would any human being have suggested
this as the style of negotiation to be adopted, or a proposition of this
nature as the basis of the settlement to be offered? Yet, sir, if your
series of articles does not mean this, I am unable to discover what it
does mean. Your main ground of accusation is that Lord Ashburton has
given up a part—I have no objection to say a very large part—of the
territory in dispute, when we were, you say, entitled to it all. We had
got a report from our commissioners, which proved our case to our own
complete satisfaction.4 We had obtained our own consent to keep the
whole country. We had sat as judges in our own cause, and nothing
remained but to execute the verdict pronounced by that impartial
tribunal. It is difficult to see, on this showing, what Lord Ashburton
was sent across the Atlantic to do; for I do not suppose his
instructions were to argue the matter à champ clos with Mr. Tyler,5 the
report in his hand, until he brought over that gentleman, and along with
him the whole American people, to the English way of thinking on the
subject.

Where then is the candour of urging, in condemnation of the treaty, our
own opinion of our own right, which, if it be an objection to this,
would have availed equally against any other treaty by which a person in
his senses could have expected to effect a settlement of the
differences? I do not mean to weary you by prolonging the discussion on
the details of this interminable question. Mr. Featherstonhaugh’s report
shall, for me, be the most irrefragable of documents; it shall have
proved our entire case, by evidence which only the utmost perversity and
folly could resist. It is very natural and very usual for the plaintiff
in a cause, to think all this in favour of his own side. But unhappily
it is also very common for the defendant to think the exact contrary. It
may be very shameful that persons with opposite interests on a question
should take such opposite views of it. But as it is a fact, grounded on
the testimony of experience, mankind have Edition: current; Page: [834]
generally been of opinion that it is not advisable to take an interested
party’s views of his own case; that in general he had better forbear to
act upon it himself; and that when no tribunal exists having authority
over both parties, nor any umpire whom both would accept, that sort of
medium between the pretensions on both sides, commonly called a
compromise, will in general be not only the most expedient arrangement,
but the nearest approach to substantial justice which the circumstances
admit of. Accordingly, in the year immediately preceding Lord
Ashburton’s mission, the voice of every rational person in both nations
was in favour of a compromise. When a special envoy was appointed,
nobody had any doubt that a compromise was to be attempted; and at this
moment everybody is in reality very glad that it has been effected, and
would have been very much disappointed if it had not.

I am quite aware of the volley of argument and oratory which may be
opened from the old topic of the danger of yielding to unjust
pretensions, the imprudence as well as spiritlessness of submitting to
aggression in order to avoid inconveniences, the preferableness of
actual war to the reputation of an over-dread of it, &c. &c. These are
truisms which nobody desires to dispute. When a real injury is
attempted; when, for the purpose of insult, or in the spirit of
ambitious encroachment, a neighbour seizes, or endeavours to seize, upon
some possession belonging to us, or to usurp from us something generally
acknowledged to be our right, nobody but a coward would offer him half
the amount on condition of not disturbing us in the remainder. But the
present is a case of a totally different complexion. In the first place
there is no injury, no aggression, but a fair and allowable difference
of opinion. An absurd treaty, framed in ignorance of the country, and in
terms which no one could understand, left the question in complete
uncertainty; and each party might, and in fact did, in perfect good
faith, believe that it had right on its side.6 You yourself admit that
our right was not proved until the commission made their report (though
just as noisily asserted before as after the appearance of that
wonderful document) and since there are many Englishmen who think that
the report has not proved it, there is little wonder that the American
people should think the same.

But, in the next place, suppose that it really had been, in the
beginning of the dissension, a question of injury; that America had been
guilty of an intentional and unwarranted aggression upon an indisputable
right of ours, which it was incumbent on us to repel, even though war
were the result—the time for resisting Edition: current; Page: [835] the
injury was the time when it commenced, and not twenty-five years
afterwards.7 If there is a proposition in international policy more
plain than another, it is, that a question which has been allowed to
remain open for that space of time, must either go on to a war, or be
settled by a compromise. One generation has passed away, and another has
grown up in the belief, well founded or not, that its own side of the
question was right. When this is the case, you will vainly strive to
convince them that they were wrong. A nation cannot change in a few
weeks, an opinion a quarter of a century old in its own favour. This may
be very pitiful; but it is because human nature is thus pitifully
constituted, that policemen and judges have been found necessary. When a
dispute between two nations has lasted so many years, one or other of
them must commit the supposed meanness of giving up what it deems its
right, or else each side must abate somewhat of its claims. In the
adjustment, each will be apt to think the expectations of the other
extremely unreasonable; but the opinion which either has of its having a
right to more is not the consideration which ought to decide, either
whether there shall be a compromise or what shall be its terms.

With respect to the conditions of the compromise, something like an
equal division of the matter in dispute was the most natural and most
equitable mode of settling the question at once; or since the subject in
litigation was of much greater importance to the Americans than to us,
if the balance inclined to either side, it was most reasonable that it
should incline to theirs. But Lord Ashburton appears to have held the
scales tolerably even. His boundary line gives us, it is acknowledged, a
larger share of the territory than the King of Holland’s award, which as
we were willing to accept, we did not, it must be presumed, deem it
grossly unfair, at least as a compromise. But, it is objected, we
concede to the Americans what the former award did not give them, the
navigation of the St. John’s,8 a concession which cost us nothing, but
by which, on the contrary, as their trade by that river will be chiefly
with ourselves or our colonies, we equally with them shall be gainers.
But it is pretended that the presence of Americans on our river will be
dangerous to us, not in time of war with America, for then they would,
of course, be excluded, but by enabling them to aid or foment internal
disturbances. Why more so, I should be glad to know, than their presence
on our highways, where they are already entitled to be, and from which
nobody has ever dreamt of excluding them?

As for the pettifogging questions which you profess to think of so much
Edition: current; Page: [836] importance, about Rouse’s Point, or any
other unheard-of military station on one or other side of the boundary,
these are scarcely the sort of objections one is expected to hear from
the Morning Chronicle. Does modern warfare turn upon the possession of a
frontier post more or less?—a post, too, from which whoever is strongest
in the field could expel the other in the first week after the
commencement of hostilities, if, as is scarcely probable, he thought it
worth while. Lord Ashburton is to be commended for not attaching
exaggerated importance to these misères. The wisdom of nations consists
in avoiding occasions of quarrel, and in removing them as early as
possible when they arise; not in keeping a dispute open, in order that,
when it has grown into a war, the war may be carried on with some
infinitesimal fraction more of advantage to their own side. If war
should come, the issue, we may rely upon it, will be determined by quite
another class of considerations than these. Every person who has not
some extremely strong interest in maintaining the contrary, knows
perfectly well that our retaining or not our American territories, in
case of a war with the United States, depends simply and solely upon our
so acting in the meanwhile, that when the time comes we shall be found
in possession of the sincere adherence and attachment of the colonists.
Without that, no military force that we could afford to maintain in the
colonies, would hold them against the far larger force which the
vicinity of the enemy would enable them to pour down upon us. With it,
the whole strength of the union, when it shall have grown to three times
what it is, will not suffice to tear them from us. Let us have the
affections of the Canadians, and let the Americans have Rouse’s Point.
If we gain one additional chance in twenty thousand of averting a war by
the relinquishment of that regretted promontory, we have made an
advantageous exchange, and Lord Ashburton would have been much to blame
if he had perilled the ratification of his treaty by objecting to
arrange the matter on that basis.

295.: TORRENS’S LETTER TO SIR ROBERT PEEL
 SPECTATOR, 28 JAN., 1843, PP. 85-6

Mill’s comment on the economic and social life of Britain continues in
this notice of Robert Torrens’s A Letter to the Right Honourable Robert
Peel, Bart., M.P. &c. &c. on the Condition of England, and on the Means
of Removing the Causes of Distress (London: Smith Elder, 1843). The
review, in the Spectator’s “Library” section, is headed as title. It is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “A review of Col. Torrens’ Letter to
Sir Robert Peel ‘on the Condition of the country’ in the Spectator of
28th January 1843”

(MacMinn, p. 55).

colonel torrens has done good service both to political science and to
the exigencies of the moment by this pamphlet. It is long since
temporary events Edition: current; Page: [837] have given birth to a
publication more full of matter for permanent thought. It takes a
comprehensive and far-sighted view of the circumstances on which the
industrial prosperity of Britain and the condition of all classes of our
population will ultimately depend: and although the author, as is not
unusual with him, seems to us to overstate the importance and urgency of
a portion of his doctrines in their application to the immediate
circumstances of the country, this exaggeration is venial if it tends to
fix the earlier attention of statesmen upon perils which every day
brings nearer, and upon precautions which cannot without imminent
mischief be much longer neglected.

From the time when the mechanical inventions of the era of Watt and
Arkwright1 made England the principal manufacturing nation of the globe,
an ever larger and at length a preponderant part of her population have
gained their subsistence by the production of manufactured articles for
foreign markets. The condition of this great and growing mass of human
beings has, during the whole period, been on the average considerably
superior, as to the quantity of the produce of labour which they could
command, to the condition of the corresponding classes in other
countries: but it has been subject to great vicissitudes, and chequered
by occasional intervals of severe distress. We are now in one of the
severest of these; one which has already surpassed the usual duration of
such periods, and, long after most people expected it to terminate,
shows no signs of termination. Is this, then, a passing crisis like the
rest, or the indication of a permanent change? Is the sun of our
manufacturing superiority momentarily eclipsed, or is it sinking below
the horizon?

Colonel Torrens is of the latter opinion. He deems the time to be
approaching when England will be unable to continue manufacturing for
foreign markets, unless by submitting to a fall of the wages of our
artisans, down to, or even below, the foreign level. Our peculiar
position, as a people selling our goods in foreign markets and yet
making greater gains than our foreign competitors, depends, in his view,
upon circumstances essentially temporary. It depends upon our being able
to produce manufactured goods with a smaller quantity of labour than
other countries. This is owing to “mechanical inventions, manual
dexterity, and productive coal-mines.” [P. 10.] To whatever extent these
advantages enable us to produce the same quantity of manufactured goods
with fewer hands than our neighbours, to the same extent those hands may
be better paid. But if these advantages ceased, we could not continue to
sell in the same markets with foreigners and yet pay higher wages than
they. And if the power of cheaper production were not only lost by us
but transferred to foreigners, (by reason, for instance, of their easier
access to the raw material,) we could only maintain a competition with
them by a fall of wages even below their level.

Edition: current; Page: [838]
Now, our advantages in cost of production during the war,2 when we had
the full benefit of the inventions of Watt and Arkwright while other
nations had not yet acquired them, were immense: but since the peace,
all other nations have been rapidly making up their lee-way. American
labour, even as applied to manufactures, is as efficient as our own;
that of the principal Continental nations is rapidly approaching to
ours. They now obtain all mechanical inventions almost as early as
ourselves; and the skill of their operatives cannot long continue
inferior. It is in cheapness of coal only, and that to a very moderate
extent, that we can hope to retain any superiority; amply compensated,
in the case of several of our competitors, by their cheaper command over
the raw materials of our manufactures. We cannot, therefore, expect much
longer to retain the greater part of our foreign trade, and at the same
time uphold a rate of money-wages exceeding that of the Continent.

The same conclusions may be deduced still more directly from the most
universal truths of political economy. A nation cannot maintain higher
wages than other countries, except in the proportion in which the
general productiveness of her industry is superior. For if she could,
those higher wages must be at the expense of profits. But profits
cannot, in the present state of civilization, be depressed in any
country much below the general level of the commercial world, since
otherwise capital would emigrate, and restore the balance. Wages,
therefore, in England, must cease to be higher than on the Continent,
when the productiveness of English ceases to surpass that of Continental
labour.

These are the abstract doctrines of our author; which, as abstract
doctrines, we cannot gainsay; but as truths applicable to the present
circumstances of England, they do not appear to us of very serious
moment. Doubtless, the industrial progress of foreign nations does and
must progressively diminish the inferiority in the productiveness of
their labour as compared with ours. But there is still a large margin,
on which it will take them many years, if not generations, seriously to
encroach. Our advantages are stated by Colonel Torrens to be, besides
cheap coal, “mechanical inventions” and “manual dexterity.” We should
rather say, not the mere dexterity, but the efficiency in all respects,
moral and physical, of British labourers. This is not the mere effect of
practice and training; it is a feature of national character. An
Englishman is a more hard-working animal than a Frenchman or a German:
he throws more of his energy, more (we may say) of his life, into his
work. Competent witnesses, who have compared English with Continental
labour, generally deem English labour the cheaper of the two at a much
higher price. Before a Continental operative can be as steady a workman
as an Englishman, his whole nature must be changed: he must acquire both
the virtues and the defects of the English labourer; he must become as
patient, as conscientious, but also as careworn, as anxious, as joyless,
as dull, as Edition: current; Page: [839] exclusively intent upon the
main chance, as his British compeer. He will long be of inferior value
as a mere machine, because, happily for him, he cares for pleasure as
well as gain. In America, indeed, labour is as efficient as with us; but
in America wages are already higher than in England.

And even in mechanical inventions, we shall probably maintain our
superiority somewhat longer than Colonel Torrens expects. It is true,
inventions spread rapidly from country to country, but not so the power
of bringing them into profitable use. In that respect, the advantage of
having large masses of capital already accumulated is immense. There are
as many inventions made on the other side of the Channel as on this; but
it is to England that the inventors bring their inventions when they
desire to make money by them.

We have on the whole, then, no expectation that the superiority of
England, as a manufacturing nation, will be very seriously undermined in
our own time. And if it were, the evil with which we are menaced is not,
when closely examined, so very frightful as the terms in which it is
announced might lead one to imagine. The threat is, not that wages will
be low, but that they will be no higher than the wages of the same
description of labourers in some other countries. And as the process by
which this result is to be brought about consists of a great improvement
in the productive resources of those countries, we may reasonably hope
that it will be accomplished fully as much by a rise in the remuneration
of their labour as by a fall in our own.

But how if all other nations adopt restrictive tariffs? How if, by
imposing duties on English manufactures, fully equivalent to their
superior cheapness, foreign governments should prematurely force our
goods to meet theirs on terms of mere equality, or positive inferiority?
Here, undoubtedly, is the real source of alarm; and here it is that the
principles of this pamphlet become of immediate practical application.
If foreign nations generally adopt this policy and persevere in it, our
manufactures will either be excluded from their markets, or will find
admittance only by a great reduction of money-wages; and the train of
consequences described and characterized by Colonel Torrens will then be
inevitable, unless remedial measures adequate to so critical a state of
things can be devised and adopted.

Here, then, is the really vital question of practical statesmanship for
England, so far as material interests are concerned. With universal free
trade, England might not indeed remain for ever, but would be tolerably
secure of remaining for generations to come, the workshop of the world.
Not how to retain her natural superiority, but how to make herself
independent of the attempts of foreign governments to counteract it
artificially by restrictive tariffs, is the problem for English
politicians.

Three different remedies have been suggested; and these are fully and
elaborately discussed by Colonel Torrens.

The first is the repeal of the Corn-laws. Of this our author is an
earnest Edition: current; Page: [840] advocate. But he does not
anticipate from it all the benefits which sanguine persons have
prophesied. [Pp. 29-32.] If by abolishing the Corn-laws we could induce
foreign governments to repeal their restrictions, we should indeed
arrest the evil. But if not, we should only succeed in slightly
alleviating its pressure. With money-wages reduced to the level of
France, it would be some relief to our labourers if the money were made
to go further in the purchase of corn. But as corn would still be dearer
than in France by the charges of importation, while money-wages were the
same, real wages would be lower than in France, though not quite so much
lower as they would be if the Corn-laws were maintained.

The second remedy which has been thought of is the improvement of our
own agriculture. [Pp. 32-7.] This would relieve our labourers in the
same manner, by making their diminished money-wages go further in the
purchase of the main necessaries of life. But it is quite problematical
whether any practicable agricultural improvement would render food
permanently cheaper here than on the Continent; while such improvements,
(however salutary their ultimate effect,) if introduced on a great
scale, would in the first instance diminish greatly the employment of
labour on the land, and aggravate instead of relieving the immediate
distress of the population. The introduction, for example, of Scotch
agriculture into Ireland, would scatter the Irish labouring population
as paupers and beggars over the Three Kingdoms, and “wheat-fed,
decent-clad, cottage-lodged England, would disappear under the avalanche
of potato-and-weed-fed, half-naked, mud-lodged Ireland.” [P. 37.]

One remedy remains; and that is, to supply the loss of our foreign
customers, by raising up new, young, prosperous agricultural communities
beyond the sea. [Pp. 76-94.] This is the great resource which Mr.
Wakefield first pointed out the means of turning to useful account;3 and
almost from the first promulgation of Mr. Wakefield’s views, Colonel
Torrens has been their earnest and intelligent apostle.4 He has urged
these views in season and out of season, never wearying, and never
dreading the reproach of repetition; and nowhere has he done this good
service more effectually than in the present pamphlet. Nowhere will the
reader find more completely demonstrated than here, the reviving effect
which would be produced upon the industrial state of a country in which
both labour and capital are every year more and more redundant, by the
transfer of large masses of both to her outlying possessions, there to
raise raw produce for exchange against the manufactures of the parent
nation. And this, as our author clearly shows, could be accomplished
without taxation—by the mere guaranteeing of Edition: current; Page:
[841] loans, on which, if the colonizing scheme were sufficiently
comprehensive, a large interest would be securely paid from the proceeds
of the industry which those very advances would set in motion.

It is really time that our statesmen should consent to occupy themselves
in sober earnest with such suggestions as these, and not continue to
reject them as “projects” and “theories”: expressions never applied, we
observe, to any proposition which is pressed upon Government by a dozen
monied persons who fancy they have a private interest in it; but there
is a prejudice against all views which appear to be taken up
disinterestedly and from public motives—as if nobody who is worth
listening to could have any intellect to spare from the pursuit of his
own emolument for so trifling a matter as the public good. We predict,
nevertheless, that in no long period Systematic Colonization will force
itself upon our rulers, as an indispensable measure, not only of
industrial policy, but of national safety. While the Corn-laws last,
little will probably be done towards what would be deemed by a large
portion of the community a mere trick to save the “landlord’s monopoly.”
But that great moral barrier to a right understanding of the causes of
national calamity once swept away, the Minister, whoever he be, that has
the wisdom and the courage to originate a great system of colonization,
on the only principles on which it can be any thing but a miserable
abortion, will find, we believe, in the intelligent of all parties, a
completeness of preparation and a strength of support of which few yet
dream.


296.: LORD BROUGHAM AND M. DE TOCQUEVILLE
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 20 FEB., 1843, P. 3

Alexis Clérel de Tocqueville (1805-59), the French historian and social
analyst whom Mill knew and whose De la démocratie en Amérique he had
twice fully reviewed and praised (CW, Vol. XVIII, pp. 47-90 and
153-204), had made a speech on 28 Jan., 1843, in the Chamber of Deputies
on the Right of Search (Moniteur, 1843, pp. 162-4). Lord Brougham took
exception to his remarks on 2 Feb., in the course of a speech at the
opening of Parliament (PD, 3rd ser., Vol. 66, cols. 33-48).
Tocqueville’s letter of protest of 10 Feb. and Brougham’s reply of 14
Feb. were printed in the Morning Chronicle on 16 Feb., p. 5 (and in the
Spectator, 18 Feb., pp. 154-55, and elsewhere). In the course of a
letter to Tocqueville of 20 Feb. enclosing a copy of this item, Mill
remarks that he is not surprised at English misunderstanding of
Tocqueville’s position: “il est très naturel que les Anglais ne
comprennent pas la France, pas plus que les Français ne comprennent
l’Angleterre” (EL, CW, Vol. XIII, p. 570). His letter, headed as title
with the subhead, “To the Editor of the Morning Chronicle,” is described
in his bibliography as “A letter signed A and headed ‘Lord Brougham and
M. de Tocqueville’ in the Morning Chronicle of 20th February 1843”

(MacMinn, p. 55).

sir,—

You have aided in giving publicity to a correspondence between Lord
Brougham and M. de Tocqueville, which, from the interest of the subject,
and Edition: current; Page: [842] the celebrity of the disputants, has
attracted considerable attention, and in which, not unnaturally,
perhaps, the victory seems to have been generally awarded to our own
countryman. Will you, in justice to one of the most eminent thinkers and
writers of the age, allow it to be pointed out through your journal,
that M. de Tocqueville’s meaning has been entirely misunderstood and
misinterpreted by Lord Brougham? It is seldom worth while to occupy the
public with questions implicating only the good sense and candour of an
individual; but as the writings of M. de Tocqueville are of value to all
Europe, his reputation is so too; and in the present state of feeling in
this country towards France, a state of feeling which Lord Brougham has
very laudably endeavoured to mitigate, it is a real evil that one of the
best and wisest men in France should be undeservedly deemed to exhibit
in himself a concentration of the worst prejudices and faults of his
weaker countrymen.

Lord Brougham accused M. de Tocqueville of “marvellous ignorance”1 on a
question on which he had made an elaborate speech to the Chamber of
Deputies, the question of the right of search. Lord Brougham supposes
him to have said that, by the treaties in force, an English cruiser
could carry a French vessel to an English port, to be tried and
sentenced for slave-trading by an English tribunal; and marvellous
indeed must have been M. de Tocqueville’s ignorance if he had believed
this to be the case. M. de Tocqueville thought he had done enough to
repel the imputation, by sending to Lord Brougham the printed report of
his speech,2 but it seems he reckoned without his antagonist; for Lord
Brougham, with the words before him, persists in the accusation, and
says that M. de Tocqueville must have meant what he says he did not
mean, and cannot possibly have meant what he affirms he did.3 Let us see
which is right. These are the words:

“Les traités de 1831 et de 1833 contiennent une disposition tout aussi
singulière; ils accordent au tribunal d’une nation le droit de juger une
nation étrangère.”4 They grant to a tribunal of either nation the right
of judging another nation.

Now will any one who knows either French, or common sense, deliberately
assert that “juger une nation” ever means, or can possibly mean, to
judge, not the nation, but the captain and crew of a vessel belonging to
a merchant of that Edition: current; Page: [843] nation? “Juger une
nation” can bear only one meaning—to give judgment against the nation
itself, that is, against its government; and this is what, under the
treaties in question, the courts of another and a foreign country can
do. M. de Tocqueville meant, that if a French vessel, seized by England
as a slave-trader, and tried, where alone, under the treaties, it can be
tried, by a French court, is pronounced by that court to have been
seized wrongfully, the French court can award damages against the
English government; or an English court could award them against the
French government in the reverse case: and this provision M. de
Tocqueville (I believe quite rightly) called extraordinary, and unheard
of previously to the slave-trade treaties. That he was understood in
this sense by his audience, is proved by M. Berryer’s exclamation, “Oui,
pour l’indemnité!” and M. de Tocqueville was about to explain himself
more fully, when the general sense of the chamber was expressed that it
was unnecessary.5 When M. de Tocqueville is speaking of what the
treaties permit to be done by one nation against ships or persons of
another, he does not designate these last as “une nation,” but as “des
criminels d’une nation.”6

Surely either Lord Brougham’s knowledge of French, or his candour, or at
least his calmness and considerateness, are greatly at fault here.

Lord Brougham further accuses M. de Tocqueville of having omitted all
mention of the unratified American treaty.7 On this point I do not feel
quite competent to defend M. de Tocqueville. If he knew of the treaty,
he probably thought that, never having gone beyond the preliminary
stages, it could not constitute a diplomatic precedent. I am ready to
join with any one in regretting that so wise a man did not feel and use
the strong argument which this treaty, even though unratified, affords
against those French orators and journalists who pretend that the right
of search, existing under the treaties in force, is offensive to even
the keenest susceptibility on the subject of national honour and
independence. But we must not be too severe upon an orator in a
deliberative assembly for not thinking it his business to point out and
expose the exaggerations on his own side. M. de Tocqueville himself has
not been guilty of contending that these treaties offend national
honour; at least, I can find nothing to that effect in his speech. His
objection to them is of a much more reasonable kind. He says these
treaties give to the cruisers of each nation extensive powers of
interrupting and molesting the trading vessels of the other, and this
arrangement might work well and harmoniously as long as there was
perfect good will and friendly feeling between the two nations; but
when, unhappily, Edition: current; Page: [844] feelings of sympathy and
alliance have given place for the present to those of mutual irritation
and jealousy, the same degree of interference can scarcely continue to
be exercised without producing collisions and a growing exasperation,
which must endanger every year more and more the peace between the two
countries. Therefore, says he, if you wish for peace, invite the English
government to abolish these treaties, the entire inefficacy of which,
for their avowed object, is confessed by the best English authorities;
professing at the same time your wish to unite with England, and with as
many other civilised nations as possible, in urging upon the only two
Christian countries whose laws still permit the importation of slaves,
the abolition of the traffic, and the adoption of effectual means for
closing their markets, which, and which alone, will really put an end to
the trade. And, said M. de Tocqueville, if this were the tone taken by
our government, I do not believe the British nation would be so
unreasonable as to reject, still less to resent, the proposition.8

These views of M. de Tocqueville may be right or wrong, but they surely
are such as may be held by an honest and rational person, without
exposing him to the imputation of wishing to exasperate the unhappy
animosity which at present exists against England in a great portion of
the French people. There are men who seek to increase this animosity;
but no one can read in a candid spirit this speech of M. de Tocqueville,
and believe him to be one of them; on the contrary, though violent
against the Guizot ministry, it is so moderate on the main question,
that no one in France could see anything in it but a desire to mollify,
instead of inflaming, the hostile feeling towards this country. It is
really hard that because other Frenchmen hate England, or because other
Frenchmen are absurd and intemperate, their offences should be visited
on, perhaps, the one Frenchman by whom such imputations are least
merited, and who is likely to feel them the most acutely: indeed, the
fact of his having so felt them is the main reason of his having, by the
tone of his letter, given to his adversary the advantage of superior
temper, of which that adversary has made such skilful use, and to which
I conceive he is chiefly indebted for his apparent victory.

297.: THE BANK CHARTER QUESTION [1]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 20 APR., 1844, P. 4

For the previous renewal of the Bank Charter, in 1833, see Nos. 208,
209, and 212. That Charter was now subject to its decennial revision,
and once again the Bank’s partial monopoly of issue was the central
question. In the banking crisis of 1836-39, a number of country banks of
issue had failed, and Peel (unlike Mill) favoured the gradual
curtailment Edition: current; Page: [845] of their powers. He refused to
allow any new banks to issue notes, or existing ones to expand their
issue, in the measure that Mill here anticipates, “A Bill to Regulate
the Issue of Bank-notes, and for Giving to the Governor and Company of
the Bank of England Certain Privileges for a Limited Period,” 7 Victoria
(24 May, 1844), PP, 1844, I, 51-65, enacted as 7 & 8 Victoria, c. 32
(1844). Mill’s discussion continues in Nos. 298-300; see also his “The
Currency Question,” which appeared in the June number of the Westminster
(CW, Vol. IV, pp. 341-61). The unheaded leader is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “A leading article on the Bank Charter Question in the
Morning Chronicle of 20th April 1844”

(MacMinn, p. 57).

the time is drawing near when Sir Robert Peel must break his protracted
silence respecting the measures to be proposed to Parliament, in
connection with the approaching expiration of the Charter of the Bank of
England.

If the rules which the Prime Minister prescribes for others could for a
moment be supposed applicable to himself, we might wonder that the
declaration of his intentions on a subject of such magnitude should be
so long deferred. He has recently, in unequivocal language, stated to
the House of Commons what he thinks of those who delay the discussion of
important measures till the concluding months of the session of
Parliament.1 If the representatives of Ireland pray for a few days
longer to confer with their countrymen on a proposition which is to
convert their national representation into an engine for registering the
edicts of the Orange landed proprietary, he gives a grumbling
acquiescence, but under protest, and with an express stipulation that no
one shall hold him responsible for whatever may be the consequence of
such blameable procrastination. But it would seem that in his judgment
delay is an evil only when it is to be employed in deliberation; when
his purposes have been made known, he deems it impossible that the
nation should require any length of time for the consideration of them.
But he invariably reserves the declaration of those purposes to the
latest possible moment. It is becoming the practice of the Government to
have only one of its measures before the public at a time, withholding,
if possible, until that one is out of danger, or rejected, or withdrawn,
all knowledge of those which are to follow.

The Bank Charter question has not taken the Government by surprise.
Since the last renewal, in 1833, it has been known to every one that
this year, if not sooner, would be the time to legislate on the subject.
Having ample time to prepare, Ministers accordingly gave early note of
preparation. The settlement of the Currency was among the promises in
the Queen’s Speech;2 and, certainly, those promises were neither so many
nor so brilliant as to account for any tardiness in determining how they
were to be fulfilled. If the Ministers had not made up their mind,
during the recess, what measure they should submit to Edition: current;
Page: [846] Parliament on this subject, they must be incapable of making
it up, on reasonable grounds, at all; and if they had, what prevented
them from at once introducing their bill, that its principles and
provisions might have been canvassed, by competent persons, during the
ten weeks and upwards that have since elapsed, and the minds of
Parliament and the public prepared for an adequate discussion, before
the month of June, when, as Sir Robert Peel tells us, it becomes a
question what portion of the Government measures the Government intends
to abandon?3

Instead of this, Ministers have maintained that perfect silence which
they seem to regard as characteristic of statesmanship; and we do not
believe that there is one, even of their parliamentary supporters, who
can surmise, on just ground, what their proposition will be. The time,
however, is past when Sir Robert Peel’s silence was supposed, even by
his own party, to conceal some great mystery of state craft. He profited
by this delusion while he could; but, like most of the prestiges on
which he subsisted while out of place, it did not survive a year after
his accession to office. Most persons are now convinced that when he
says nothing, he has nothing very valuable to say; that, as was formerly
observed of another political character, when he shakes his head, there
is nothing in it.

From the remarkable absence of interest, and even of curiosity, which
prevails in almost all quarters concerning the promised measure—a state
of the public mind so unlike that which has so often before been
experienced on similar subjects—it may be inferred that, in the opinion
of the public, Ministers are not likely to propose any material
alteration in what exists; but will renew the charter of the Bank of
England, on its present footing, without extension, but also without
curtailment, of any of its exclusive privileges. This conjecture is
doubtless a very probable one. That a minister will do nothing at all,
when not urged to action by some powerful pressure, is generally a safe
enough guess. But still this is only a presumption, and sometimes fails.
What a minister will never voluntarily do, is to move in any direction
that conflicts with the interests on which he relies for support. But
where none of these interests are implicated, the habitual disposition
of official men to leave things alone alternates, especially since the
Reform Bill, with a rather strong occasional inclination to signalize
themselves by meddling. One of the principal effects of that memorable
measure, and of the general break-up of old ideas and associations which
accompanied it, was to diffuse a notion much more widely than ever
before, that the business of a Government was not to sit still and
receive the taxes, but to look out in all directions for all means which
could be discovered of conferring benefit on the community. The demand
for improvement, and the spirit of it, have been in far more active
operation upon the minds of rulers in the last eight or ten years than
formerly. But as the circumstances which stimulated the desire for
improved legislation, could not all at once confer the capacity of it
upon men who had been Edition: current; Page: [847] occupied all their
lives with any kind of objects and ideas rather than those which would
have qualified them for such a function, they are apt to come to their
new task with minds rather ill prepared; and the very men who, when
their purpose is to maintain things unaltered, have at their
fingers’-ends all the commonplaces deprecatory of “speculative changes,”
are often found, when they think the time is come for being reformers,
to be ready dupes of the crudest and most superficial theories.

We confess that in the case which has led us into this line of remark,
our fears are chiefly of this latter kind. The present system, if it can
be so called, of the currency is, doubtless, far from perfect; as is
implied in the fact, that it is a medley of several systems, founded on
conflicting principles. But we believe that the amount of practical evil
fairly attributable to its defects, has been enormously exaggerated by
most writers on the subject; while we confidently affirm, that no theory
which has been propounded for its improvement is sufficiently matured,
or has obtained that general sanction from the opinion of those who are
entitled to be considered authorities, which would justify Parliament in
making any considerable changes on the faith of such a theory. Yet we
feel by no means certain that some attempt of this nature will not, on
the present occasion, be made. If there is at present no strong
direction of public sentiment in favour of such changes, neither is
there any strong disinclination to them; while, such is the diversity of
individual opinion on the subject, and so much that is plausible may be
said in favour of almost every view, that scarcely any plan could be
proposed of which, if brought forward by Government, it could be
affirmed beforehand to be impossible that a considerable section of the
mercantile public might be induced to give it their support.


298.: THE BANK CHARTER QUESTION [2]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 26 APR., 1844, P. 4

See No. 297 for the political background of the question of policy
examined here and in Nos. 299-300. The unheaded leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A second leading article on the Bank Charter
Question in the Morning Chronicle of 26th April 1844”

(MacMinn, p. 57).

the evils to which a paper currency is liable are two in number—one is
the insolvency of the issuers, the other is fluctuation and consequent
uncertainty in value.

Propositions for the improvement of the paper currency of a country must
be directed against one or other of these two inconveniences. They must
be intended to secure either the actual holders of the paper against
loss from the inability of the issuers to meet their engagements, or the
community generally against the Edition: current; Page: [848]
inconvenience and risk of having their receipts, their payments, and
their engagements calculated in a medium of no fixed or certain value.

In the first requisite, security against loss by insolvency, the
currency of England was, until a late period, singularly defective.
While any adventurer might issue notes of so low a denomination as to be
the habitual medium for the small savings, if not for the weekly
receipts, of the better paid portion of the labouring classes, the
Legislature, in its wisdom, had subjected this power of individuals over
the national instrument of exchange to one remarkable restriction:
individuals might issue notes; associations, if they exceeded the number
of six persons, could not.1 This curious piece of legislation, which was
in perfect harmony with the spirit of the British Government up to a
comparatively recent period, did not ground itself upon any crotchetty
notion, or freak of fancy respecting the superiority of the engagements
of individuals over those of companies. The Legislature knew better.
They were quite aware that the united credit of fifty or a hundred
individuals was a better security than the credit of one, or five, or
six. It was because they knew it to be a better security that they
determined that one body—the Bank of England—should have the exclusive
power of supplying it. They erected it into a monopoly, for the benefit
of that body. They enacted that the nation should have no safe paper
currency, except the paper of the Bank of England. Unsafe paper money it
might have, as much as it pleased. Even this did not content them. Not
only in the business of issue, but in ordinary banking business, the
Bank of England obtained a similar monopoly. Not only was no other
association, of more than six partners, permitted to issue promissory
notes, but the public were not even allowed to lend money to any such
body, or merchants and agriculturists to borrow from it. No such
association was permitted to transact banking business at all. For these
restrictions no reason of public utility was so much as pretended. They
were erected avowedly for the benefit of a certain corporation, which,
beyond lending a part of its capital to Government at a low rate of
interest, and assisting the national finances in an occasional emergency
by temporary advances on the ordinary banking terms, gave no equivalent.

By this abuse of its powers, the Legislature inflicted upon the country
the most unsafe paper currency which, perhaps, ever existed along with
professed convertibility into coin. Whenever the vicissitudes of the
markets brought on a period of extensive commercial distress—and of what
regular recurrence such periods are every one knows—the evil was
heightened by numerous failures of bankers, and, among the rest, of many
who were issuers of notes. The consequences to the unfortunate holders,
many of whom, especially in the rural districts, were of the class to
whom small losses are great ones, were most distressing. This, indeed,
was the principal means by which the evils of a Edition: current; Page:
[849] commercial crisis were extended beyond the class directly
affected, the merchants and dealers, to the community generally. Of the
misery thus occasioned, vicious legislation was the direct cause. Every
labouring man or woman whose small reserve, provided by painful
self-denial for unforeseen, or, perhaps, for expected emergencies, was
swept away by one of the commercial hurricanes which periodically
prostrated the weak money-dealing establishments which alone the
Legislature suffered to exist, might with strict justice have claimed
compensation from the two Houses of Parliament by individual
subscription among their members.

The first step out of this vicious régime was made in 1826, under the
pressure of the strong popular excitement caused by the crisis of the
preceding winter, one of the most distressing ever before experienced,
and which had made peculiar havoc among banking establishments, both in
London and in the country. Under these peculiar circumstances the
Legislature partially repealed the prohibition against joint-stock banks
and banks with numerous partners.2 The exclusive privilege of the Bank
of England was not abrogated, nor could it be so before the expiration
of the charter, without compensation; but it was narrowed, with the
consent of the Bank itself, to a circle of sixty-five miles round
London. Within that distance, the Bank was still secured against the
rivality of any other banks as secure as itself; but beyond the limit
safe banks were now permitted to exist and a safe paper currency to be
provided. Along with this relaxation of the monopoly, Parliament adopted
the further precaution of suppressing all notes under five pounds. In
thus interfering with the liberty of private contract, Parliament
proceeded on what appeared the still more important principle of
protecting the poor and those who could not protect themselves. It was
affirmed that the working classes were not, and in the nature of the
case could not be, free agents in such transactions. They were
practically compelled, it was said, to take one pound notes of any sort
which were tendered by their employers. It was, therefore, thought
indispensable to limit the issue of notes to denominations too high to
be made the instruments of paying wages, and such as could not often
come into the hands of labouring people. On the necessity of this
precaution there were then, as there probably are now, differences of
opinion; but it has, at least, been effectual for its end. Whoever may
now suffer by the failure of banks, the poor cannot. Losses by paper
currency are now nearly confined to the classes who can better afford to
lose, and who, as depositors or as dealers, cannot be prevented from
suffering by failures, whether of bankers or of any other persons with
whom they have transactions.

In 1833 the privileges of the Bank of England expired, and in renewing
them a further encroachment was made on the monopoly.3 The limit of
sixty-five miles Edition: current; Page: [850] was now, to a certain
extent, removed, and companies of any number of partners were tolerated
in London for all banking purposes except the issue of notes, or other
transferable securities equivalent to them. The Bank of England has
still, in the supply of currency to London and sixty-five miles round, a
monopoly against all other issues except unsafe ones. Joint-stock banks
cannot issue paper within that limit; though any adventurer, who
succeeds in obtaining temporary credit, may and does.

This, then, is the present constitution of the currency, that is to say,
in England; for in Scotland and Ireland notes of one pound still exist
as the ordinary medium of circulation, and exist without danger. Under
the system of joint-stock banks which there exists, and which in
Scotland is as old as paper-money itself, the failure of a bank is
unknown. So far as the evil of insolvency is concerned, no reason can be
imagined for now interfering with the currency of Scotland or of
Ireland.

In England also, since the establishment of joint-stock banks, the
currency has approximated, so far as the security of the holders is
concerned, to the perfect safety of that of Scotland. Between 1826 and
the present time several epochs have intervened of commercial distress,
bankruptcies, and severe pressure on the money market. Formerly no such
period ever passed over without a crash among country bankers,
accompanied by all the evils proverbially consequent upon the nonpayment
of their notes. Since the change in the law such failures have been
rare, and have ceased to be an ordinary accompaniment of distress among
the trading classes. The reason is obvious. When numerous banking
companies existed, no private banker, whose fortune and credit were not
on a par, or nearly so, with those of a company, could succeed in
getting his notes into circulation. During the infancy of joint-stock
banks, several of them, from improvident management, were unsuccessful
in their business, and have been obliged to wind up their concerns. But,
even in these cases, we believe there has not been an instance in which
the holders of notes, at least, have been ultimate losers. The present
currency, therefore, is already sufficiently secure against the evils
arising from insolvency, and bids fair soon to attain the perfect and
unimpeachable security, not only beyond failure, but beyond all
apprehensions of failure, which has long distinguished the monetary
system of Scotland.

To render the assurance even more perfect, it has often been suggested
that all banks of issue should be required to give security, for
instance, by the deposit of stock, for the indemnification of the
holders of their notes in the event of their insolvency.4 To this
precaution, if it were really necessary, the objections are not such as
to be insuperable; but in so far as any portion of the capital of
bankers is Edition: current; Page: [851] compulsorily locked up in a
permanent investment, the equivalent of which does not necessarily come
back to them in deposits, they are to that extent disabled from
performing their regular business of making advances on mercantile
security. Nor would it be easy to make out a necessity for imposing this
inconvenient obligation, when the evil against which it is intended to
provide is non-existent in Scotland, and in England, notwithstanding the
novelty of the joint-stock system, is evidently in rapid progress
towards extinction.

Another suggestion has been made, of which the effect would be to
establish a restriction directly the reverse of that which was formerly
in force. It has been proposed that the issue of notes should be
prospectively confined to companies, no new licenses being granted to
individual bankers.5 This seems, however, a needless interference with
freedom of action. It is impossible that private bankers, except those
of the firmest credit, should long sustain themselves against the
competition of joint-stock banks. Even in London, new private banks are
now scarcely ever commenced, while not a few of those previously
established have been quietly discontinued. It may be predicted that
without any interference of Government, in a few years no private
bankers, or small banking partnerships, will exist, except those which,
from their resources and high character, are quite worthy to compete for
public confidence with the aggregate wealth of joint-stock companies.
Some private banks of this high character exist even in Scotland, and
are practically quite as secure as the larger associations.

There is, however, one extensive portion of this island in which, with
respect to currency, the old monopoly subsists; in which individuals may
create, without restriction, as much paper money as they can induce any
person to take, while no joint-stock bank of issue is permitted to enter
into competition with them. We allude not to London, where the notes of
the Bank of England exclusively circulate, but to the large circle of
sixty-five miles radius round London as a centre. There can be no reason
why the inhabitants of this large district should remain exposed to the
dangers from which it has been thought necessary to protect the rest of
their countrymen. The evil, perhaps, is not great, since the district
does not include any of the great seats of production and commerce,
while the circulation of Bank of England notes, through its whole
extent, restricts practically the issue of notes by private bankers to
rather narrow limits. Such, however, as it is, this anomaly should be
swept away.

That there should be but one bank of issue for the metropolis, where the
pecuniary transactions of the whole country are balanced and settled, is
by many considered advisable, on grounds with which danger of insolvency
has nothing to do.6 To enforce this monopoly of the currency circulating
in London, it may be Edition: current; Page: [852] necessary to superadd
a small circle, say of ten miles round it. But beyond some such limited
distance, and in districts where the notes of country bankers already
circulate, it is a perversion of reason to enact that these notes shall
be exclusively of the worst kind. Either all issues, except those of a
single body, should be prohibited, or the liberty which is allowed to
individuals should be extended to associations of any number of persons.
Among the minor changes which may be proposed in the currency by the
ministerial project, or in the course of the discussions to which it
gives rise, there is no one which seems to us less liable to any
well-grounded, or even plausible objection, than the restriction of the
monopoly of the Bank to the small but important district which it
already exclusively supplies, leaving the larger circle beyond to the
free competition of companies and individuals.

the most serious of the imputations against the currency as now
constituted, is liability to over-issue, by which is of course meant,
issue in such abundance as to depreciate the currency, or what is the
same thing, to raise general prices. The representatives of the most
opposite interests, and of the most conflicting opinions on the
practical part of the question, concur in ascribing this mischievous
tendency to the present system; but they do not equally agree as to what
is the peccant part of its construction. The country bankers almost
unanimously charge all the evil upon the Bank of England, while that
body and the advocates generally of a single bank of issue, represent
the mischief as closely connected with the multiplicity of issuers, and
especially as incurably inherent in the system acted upon by the country
banks.

It is very curious to observe the vicissitudes of the public mind in
this matter within one generation, and how rapidly the almost universal
opinion of persons supposed to be practically conversant with the
subject has passed over from one extreme to its opposite. There is a
fashion in mercantile, as well as in medical opinions. There is
generally a favourite disease and a favourite remedy; and to know what
these are we have seldom so much to consider the nature of the case as
the date of the year, whether it is 1814 or 1844.1 Between the years
1797 and Edition: current; Page: [853] 1819 the universal currency of
the kingdom was paper not exchangeable for specie.2 An inconvertible
paper currency is but another word for a currency which can be
depreciated at pleasure. There is absolutely no limit to its quantity,
except the will of the issuers. Yet, during the greater part of that
interval, the mercantile public obstinately refused to believe that
depreciation was possible. Nothing could induce the “great practical
authorities” to listen to the doctrine that a currency issued by bankers
upon bills of short dates, and grounded on actual transactions, could
ever be susceptible of excess. Issued on such terms, its amount could
never exceed the “wants of trade;” as if the wants of trade were not
unlimited, and indefinitely extensible. Those whose memory does not
reach to the period, and who are not familiar with its voluminous
controversies, can have no idea what a world of argument and explanation
were found necessary by Mr. Horner, Lord King, Mr. Blake, Mr. Huskisson,
and Mr. Ricardo,3 before the mercantile men of the time could be made to
understand that a currency, constituted like that of England, could be,
and in fact was, depreciated. Ingenuity was exhausted to explain away
all the appearances which proved it. Theories, each more absurd than its
predecessor, were set up to account for the rise of gold, when paid for
in paper, above the Mint valuation; for the permanently unfavourable
exchanges; and for the general high prices. Any supposition—no matter
what—was preferred to that of over-issue, although in an inconvertible
currency. The currency is now convertible, in law and in fact, without
the shadow of an obstacle; the smallest difference of value between gold
and paper is rendered impossible, by the perfect liberty of exchanging,
at any moment, the one for the other; and this, by the great writers on
the bullion controversy, was thought a sufficient security. No one then
supposed that a currency, really convertible, needed any additional
contrivance to render it steady in its value. Yet the public, which then
refused to see or hear such a thing as over-issue, now hears of nothing
else. Over-issue is the word for every fluctuation of the markets. The
most ordinary disturbance of prices from anticipation of deficiency, or
expected variations of demand, can be explained by nothing but
over-issue.

Although not going to this absurd length, some writers of merit and
reputation Edition: current; Page: [854] contend that, even under the
completely convertible currency which we now possess, over-issue is
possible to such an extent as to be a very serious calamity. They are
not without forcible arguments in support of their position.

They admit that, in a convertible currency, no issue of notes beyond the
quantity which would otherwise circulate as coin, can be permanently
kept in circulation. The superfluous paper is sure to be returned to the
issuers, who have to pay for it in gold. But the removal of the excess
requires some time, and takes place by means of a previous rise of
prices. The steps of the process are said to be these: the excessive
issue of paper raises prices; when prices rise, an inducement is
afforded to send increased orders for the importation of foreign
commodities; when the time arrives at which these increased importations
are to be paid for, gold must be remitted, and this gold is procured
from the Bank. But during the intervening period, which is sometimes of
considerable duration, the rise of prices, at first occasioned by the
over-issue, promotes a spirit of speculation. By speculative purchases
prices are still further raised; and the speculators, to enable them to
hold on without realising, apply to the banks for additional advances,
which, if granted, produce a still further over-issue of paper. The rise
of prices and increase of the currency may thus, in periods favourable
to speculation, proceed to a great length before the inevitable
revulsion, which, of course, will be of corresponding violence. When at
last gold begins to leave the country, the fall of prices, which must
sooner or later occur, will give rise to commercial distress,
proportioned to the previous false appearance of prosperity. But this
evil is liable to be greatly heightened by the conduct of the banks. If
they become alarmed at the rapidity with which their treasure leaves
them, they “put on the screw,” for the purpose of contracting the
currency and stopping the drain of gold; they refuse even the usual
accommodation to the merchants, who are thus deprived of their
accustomed resources at a time of more than ordinary need; or they may,
on the contrary, adopt a course less immediately harsh, but ultimately
still more fatal. Under the urgent demands made by the embarrassed
merchants, and for the sake of “supporting trade,” they may disregard
the drain of gold, and re-issue, in loans, the surplus paper which has
been returned upon their hands. By doing this, they prolong the crisis;
they prevent the complete relapse of prices which would have brought
things back rapidly to the natural course. Additional gold is now
demanded for exportation proportional to the fresh over-issue; and the
issuers are at last compelled to apply “the screw” with still greater
violence, in order to prevent the total exhaustion of their treasure.

To guard against these evils, it is affirmed to be indispensable to
place the issuing bodies under such regulation that they shall increase
their issues only when gold is flowing into the country, whereby the
currency, even if metallic, would be increased; and shall always
contract their issues when the exchanges show that gold is on the point
of flowing out. There cannot, it is justly said, be any better standard
of value than the metals. The fluctuations to which a metallic Edition:
current; Page: [855] currency would be liable, it is necessary to bear
with. But to these inevitable variations it ought not to be permitted
that paper money should superadd others. A paper currency should be so
constituted, as to be always of the same value as a currency composed
wholly of the metals. In order to be of the same value as a metallic
currency, it must be the same in quantity: it must increase and diminish
only when, and exactly as much as, a purely metallic currency would
increase and diminish. Whenever the state of the exchange tends to bring
gold into the country, the paper issues ought to increase; whenever it
carries gold out, they ought to diminish. The turn of the exchange ought
to be the sole regulator of the currency; and the more mechanically, the
more automatically it operates, the better.

Those who take this view of a paper currency—among whom Mr. Loyd, Mr.
Norman, Colonel Torrens, Mr. M’Culloch,4 and other high authorities may
be counted—think that the issue of notes should be confined to a single
body. The joint-stock banks and country bankers, they say, do not, and
perhaps cannot, regulate their issues by the exchanges. A multiplicity
of issuers is not compatible with such regulation. Each bank is urged,
by competition, to put forth its own notes, hoping that when the
revulsion comes, the loss will fall upon other banks, rather than upon
itself. The issue of a paper currency, according to these writers,
should be a public function, entrusted to the responsibility of a single
body. This body should be either a national board, or, if a corporation
like the Bank of England, it should be compelled by law to keep its
banking transactions entirely distinct from its circulation. As an
issuing body, it should hold a fixed amount of securities, to be neither
increased nor diminished; and beyond that amount, should be permitted to
issue its notes only in exchange for bullion. It should be obliged to
give its notes for bullion, or bullion for notes, whenever required.
Under this regulation, the amount of the circulation would, it is
affirmed, always be exactly the same as with a metallic currency.
Whenever the course of trade carried gold out of the country, the gold
would be obtained from the Bank in payment of its notes, and the notes
not being re-issued, the same amount would be subtracted from the paper
as would have been subtracted from a metallic currency. When the balance
of trade brings gold in, which, if the currency were metallic, would
have constituted an addition to its amount, the gold will be sold to the
Bank, and the notes delivered in exchange for it will be an addition to
the Edition: current; Page: [856] paper currency exactly equivalent. In
this manner, according to the opinion of these authorities, it is
possible to secure the great fundamental requisite of a paper currency,
steadiness of value, by making the variations in its quantity exactly
conform to those which would occur in a currency altogether metallic.

On another occasion we shall state the considerations by which these
arguments, powerful as they appear, have been at least balanced, if not
completely overruled.


300.: THE BANK CHARTER QUESTION [4]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 30 APR., 1844, PP. 5-6

For the background, see Nos. 297-9. This unheaded leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A fourth leading article on the Bank Charter
Question in the Morning Chronicle of 30th April 1844”

(MacMinn, p. 57).

we gave, on Saturday, a concise statement of the doctrines and arguments
of those who, thinking it necessary that a paper currency should exactly
conform in its quantity to what would be the amount of a purely metallic
circulation, are of opinion that this can only be secured by confining
the powers of issue to a single body, compelled by law to regulate its
issues strictly by the exchanges.

But these opinions, though plausibly supported by writers of high
authority, are opposed by arguments at least as forcible, and by
authorities equally high. The case on the other side of the question may
be rested upon the pamphlet entitled An Inquiry into the Currency
Principle, lately published by Mr. Tooke,1 a writer who has long been
considered one of the highest, if not the very highest, of living
authorities, on all questions which require the combination of a
knowledge of the scientific principles of commerce, and a familiarity
with its practical details.

In the first place, granting the truth of the fundamental principle
contended for, that the variations in the amount of a paper currency
ought to be precisely conformable to those which would take place in a
currency wholly metallic, it is denied that this conformity would exist
under the system proposed. The doctrine assumes that if the circulating
medium consisted exclusively of coin, all gold exported would be taken
from the currency; whenever imported, it would all be added to the
currency; and that the paper, therefore, should be made to vary in the
same manner. But this assumption is not tenable. There is at all times,
in every commercial country, a large amount of bullion, as a common
article of Edition: current; Page: [857] merchandise, waiting for a
market; and this is applicable, and is continually applied, to the
payment of international balances, without trenching upon the currency.
Doubtless, if the circumstances of the country, in regard to foreign
trade, became such as to produce a permanent diminution of its stock of
the precious metals, involving, as this would do, a permanent rise in
their value, the amount of coin in circulation would eventually diminish
in the same ratio. But the mere transportation of bullion from country
to country, in the ordinary course of trade, going out one month or year
and returning the next, according to the accidents of the markets, would
have no such effect. Such transfers would often occur under a purely
metallic system, without diminishing the currency in the one case, or
adding to it in the other. A metallic currency, therefore, would not
necessarily, and in all cases, be affected by the exchanges; and if a
paper currency were strictly regulated by them, it would be subject to
variation in cases in which a metallic currency would not vary. Under a
paper system, as often as the precious metals are wanted for
exportation, the banks, being by profession dealers in them, are usually
had recourse to. Suppose a balance due to a foreign country. The gold
required for making the payment is obtained from the Bank of England in
exchange for its notes. These notes, under the proposed system, the Bank
would not be permitted to re-issue, until the course of trade again
brought in gold, to be offered for sale. In the intermediate period, the
currency, consisting of paper, will have been artificially contracted;
when if it had consisted wholly of the metals, it would possibly, and
even probably, have remained unaltered in amount.

The object, therefore, to which so much importance is attached—that of
keeping the amount of paper issues precisely identical with the amount
of coin which they displace—would be as often frustrated as promoted by
the means proposed. But the objection taken to the theory is still more
fundamental than this. The principle itself is denied. The necessity or
advantage of conformity between the amount of a paper currency, and what
would have been the amount of a metallic, is not admitted. It is denied
that the temporary augmentation of issues, which is the only
augmentation possible under a convertible currency, has the injurious
effects ascribed to it; that it tends to raise prices, or to promote
speculation.

According to the views which we are now stating, it is not every
increase of the quantity of money in the hands of the public which tends
to raise general prices; but only an increase of the money which is in
the hands of those who are purchasing for their own consumption: in
other words, an increase in the aggregate money incomes of the
community. If an addition were made to the currency in such a manner as
to be at once paid away in wages, or added in any other form to the
funds destined to be expended as revenue, this would raise prices. And
any increase of the currency which could be kept permanently out would,
no doubt, in time permeate all the channels of circulation, and
ultimately Edition: current; Page: [858] add to the funds intended for
personal expenditure. But the issues of the banks do not take place in
this manner. They are made, not to consumers, but to dealers, to be
employed, not in their expenditure for consumption, but in their
pecuniary transactions with other dealers. An increase of money in the
hands of dealers cannot tend to raise prices as between consumer and
dealer. But will it not raise prices as between dealer and dealer? To
this it is answered, no; for the following reason:—all purchases by
dealers are made with a view to the consumer. The consumer is to pay
everything at last. It is from the price which the consumer pays that
the dealer is to be indemnified for what he has paid, and to derive a
profit. A dealer, therefore, will not consent to pay an advanced price
unless he sees a prospect that the price will also rise to the consumer,
who is to reimburse his advances. A speculative rise of prices in the
great transactions between dealers is always grounded upon some expected
deficiency of supply, or increase of the demand for consumption, by
which, if it takes place, the consumer will be forced to pay a higher
price; and if the speculative rise goes beyond what turns out to be the
actual rise to the consumer, the speculation fails.

On these grounds it is contended that an increase of paper, as it takes
place in this country, and so long as the paper is convertible, does not
tend to raise prices, and does not constitute a new and independent
source of demand. Increased issues, made by banks in advances to
dealers, are, it is affirmed, an effect, not a cause, of demand. If
unusual activity of trade increases the number of transactions, or if,
from circumstances affecting the cost of production or the supply of
commodities, those transactions take place at higher prices, this will
naturally lead to an increased issue of bank notes, if bank notes happen
to be the most convenient medium for the purposes in view. But supposing
any increased issue of bank notes to be prevented, this would not
prevent the transactions: if they could not take place by bank notes,
they would be effected by bills of exchange; if this also was made
impracticable, they would take place by checks, and transfers of credit
in bankers’ books. The vast majority of transactions among dealers are
already effected in these modes, and all might be so. The whole of the
mercantile transactions of Amsterdam and Hamburg were formerly (at
Hamburg they are still) liquidated by simple transfers of credit in the
books of the Amsterdam and Hamburg banks, with whom every merchant kept
an account. The speculative transactions of commerce, which are supposed
to be affected in such an extraordinary degree by variations in the
amount of bank notes, are, in truth, entirely independent of any such
medium, and would take place to exactly the same extent if bankers’
paper did not exist. What they really depend upon is credit; in what
particular shape credit is given is immaterial. To alter, therefore, the
whole banking system of the country, to sacrifice all the existing
interests concerned in banks of issue, and impose new restrictions upon
the free agency of the community, for the purpose of averting dangers
entirely chimerical, and of discouraging speculations to which the
change proposed could Edition: current; Page: [859] not oppose the
slightest obstacle, would, according to the views we have now stated, be
uncalled for and indefensible.

On this controversy we do not take upon ourselves to pronounce any
decision. The question is still sub judice. The minds of the most
competent thinkers are not yet, generally speaking, made up. There is
room and necessity for much further discussion. The views promulgated by
Mr. Tooke have yet to be maturely weighed, and due regard paid to what
will doubtless be urged in contradiction to them. As yet, no answer to
his pamphlet has appeared. In the meantime the Legislature, in such a
state of the subject, can have but one rule—Dans le doute, abstiens-toi.
While the question is unsettled in the greater number of thinking minds,
however positively decided in many foolish ones, let it alone. Renew the
present Charter of the Bank of England, with little alteration, for a
brief period; five years would be sufficient; more than ten are not to
be thought of; and reserve to Parliament an opportunity of reconsidering
the subject, when the opinions of the best judges shall have become
sufficiently unanimous.


301.: THE MALT TAX
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 13 JAN., 1846, P. 4

The malt tax, which Mill here supports, was an excise tax on the barley
that was malted to make beer. First imposed in 1697 by 8 & 9 William
III, c. 22, it had reached its present level of 20s. 8d. a quarter in
1819. Periodic attempts to have it reduced or removed (most notably in
1821, 1833, 1834, and 1835) had been initiated by the agricultural
interest. Some reformers and Radicals co-operated, arguing that the tax
burdened the working man as well as the farmer and wishing to encourage
retrenchment, but others voted for its retention for the sake of the
revenue. The unheaded leader is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A
leading article on the Malt Tax, in the Morning Chronicle of 13th
January 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 58).

although the pretence of “peculiar burdens”1 has lost the efficacy it
once had as a popular argument for the Corn-laws, and there is now no
danger that the landlords will be much longer permitted to compensate
themselves for these pretended burdens by a slice from every loaf
consumed in the country, there is still some fear lest the same bad
argument may be held good as an excuse for some other injustice, as
flagrant though not yet so thoroughly exposed. There seems a general
expectation that Sir Robert Peel will clog his proposition respecting
the Corn-laws with some project of a revision of the general system of
taxation, for the benefit of the landlords. It is not wonderful that
such a belief is entertained. Neither friends nor enemies can bring
themselves to think it possible Edition: current; Page: [860] that a
leader of Tories can reform any abuse thoroughly. They always look for
some qualification, for some unjust condition. Sir Robert Peel, in
particular, has raised up to himself, by a long series of contrary
professions, so many difficulties to pursuing a straight course, that no
one can help expecting to find a bend in his path.2 Then, too, he has
been flattered into the belief that finance is his peculiar forte. The
only measure of his four years’ government which is wholly his own, in
which he had been anticipated by no Whigs or Liberals—the income-tax—was
a financial measure; and he is supposed to feel a parent’s affection for
this, his only child. There is, accordingly, a notion abroad that he
will propose the abrogation of the taxes which the landlords most
complain of, and will supply their place by a large increase of the
income-tax.

Such things must not be reckoned improbable because they are monstrous,
nor must it be thought of no consequence that they are proposed because
public opinion would be sure to defeat them. Defeated they might be, but
Corn-law repeal would for the time be defeated along with them. If the
Minister proposes them, it will be as an essential part of his measure.
He will stand or fall by it as a whole. He will not propose repeal
conditionally, and vote for it unconditionally. If his conditions are
refused he will throw up the measure, and without him it cannot be
carried in the present Parliament. It is, therefore, important that a
proposition to replace one gross injustice by another should not be made
by him, and that the public should early manifest their opinion in such
a manner as to deter him from attempting it.

Among the taxes which the Protectionists lay claim to as “peculiar
burdens,” the most important is the malt-tax. It yields five millions
sterling to the revenue. Take it off, and if the substitute is to be an
income-tax, the present tax must be doubled. The change would be for the
worse in every respect, while there is not a shadow of foundation for
the pretence on which it would depend for its justification. In no
possible sense of the word is the tax on malt a burden on agriculture.

A peculiar burden on agriculture must mean one of two things. It may
mean a burden falling on home-grown produce, but from which imported
produce is Edition: current; Page: [861] exempt. This cannot be said of
the malt-tax. Malt is not imported. If it was, it would of course be
charged with a countervailing duty. The exciseman knows no distinction
between British and foreign barley. If it is made into malt it all pays
duty. If British barley is fitter for being malted than foreign barley,
so much the better for the landlord.

Or a peculiar burden may mean a tax which falls only on the
agriculturists, which is paid wholly or chiefly by them, and not at all,
or in a much less degree, by any other part of the community. Neither is
this true of the malt-tax. Everybody knows that it is paid in the price,
or what is equivalent, in the strength, of beer. All consumers of beer
pay it. Beer is not a beverage confined to country people. They are not
more than a third part of the population, and they do not drink more
than a third part of the beer,—they do not drink nearly so much. There
is, in all probability, more beer consumed, in proportion to the
population, by the inhabitants of towns than by those of the country,
and, if quality as well as quantity be considered, very much more.

It would be difficult to show any five millions of the taxation of the
country liable to as little objection as the five millions which are the
produce of the malt-tax. There are few taxes collected at less expense;
there are few which, in proportion to the amount, give rise to so little
fraud and evasion. It falls proportionally heavier on the poor than on
the rich, which would be a conclusive objection to it as the sole or the
principal source of revenue, but not conclusive against it as one tax
among a number of others, many of which (the income-tax being one) do
not fall on the poor at all. The balance is not held even; but it easily
might and ought to be; and there are many better ways of rectifying it
than by abolishing a tax which does not fall on the necessaries of the
poor. There are no taxes so little objectionable as taxes on luxuries,
and among luxuries none are such proper subjects of taxation as
stimulants. All stimulants, whether those of the rich or of the poor,
should be taxed as high as they will bear; at the highest rate which
will not defeat the object by encouraging smuggling—the rate, in short,
which will yield the largest revenue. By taxes on stimulants, and direct
taxes equitably apportioned (not like the income-tax), this country
might raise all the revenue it requires, without any other taxes
whatever. Untax stimulants, and you cannot raise the amount without
keeping on, and laying on, taxes beyond calculation worse.

But the crowning absurdity in the case of the malt-tax is, that its
remission would not at all afford to the agriculturists the relief they
desire. It would do them no more good than taking off any other five
millions of taxes; and no good at all, if the amount were made up by any
other tax of which they paid their share. It cannot be pretended that
they would derive any peculiar benefit as consumers. They would get
their beer cheaper, and so would everybody else. But they wisely think
that they would be benefitted as producers. There would be more beer
drank, and more barley consumed. Good, under a strict Corn-law: but what
if the Edition: current; Page: [862] Corn-laws are repealed? To this
their answer is, that foreign barley will not do for malting, that it
cannot compete at any price with British barley. This would be very
consoling, doubtless, if not importing barley implied not importing at
all. But suppose the ports open, and a demand for more barley, and that
the barley must all be grown at home, what effect would this have but
that just so much the more wheat and oats would be imported? There can
be no increased growth of barley on our own land without increasing the
cost or diminishing the supply of other agricultural produce. The place
would be filled up by importation, and the agriculturists would be as
they were before. We are supposing free trade. But we question if the
case would not be the same under the existing law. The present Corn-law,
bad as it is, does not succeed in confining the country to its own
produce; and if a larger production were suddenly required, even under
the present duties a great part of the increase would probably be
obtained cheaper by importation. If so, to make the repeal of the
malt-tax any material benefit to the landlords the Corn-laws must be
made even stricter than they now are. A fortiori, on the supposition of
free-trade the gain to them would be illusory, while if the substitute
be the income-tax, the pressure of that would be very real. As it is now
assessed they are far from paying their just share of it, but there is
no doubt that what they do pay they very thoroughly dislike, and would
dislike any increase still more.


302.: THE POOR RATES AS A BURDEN ON AGRICULTURE
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 19 JAN., 1846, P. 4

This unheaded leader is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A leading
article on Poor Rates as a burthen on agriculture in the Morning
Chronicle of 19th January 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 58).

among the “peculiar burthens”1 of agriculture, of which we have long
heard so much as reasons for protection, and of which we are probably
destined to hear still more in the ensuing session, as grounds for a
re-adjustment of taxation, one which is a favourite topic with
oratorical agriculturists is the poor-rate. This plea has never gone for
much with the non-agricultural part of the public, who know well, by
disagreeable experience, that the poor-rate is anything but a “peculiar”
burthen. The towns support all their poor; the country only supports its
own. The towns contain a much larger labouring population than the
country; if among this greater number a smaller proportion are poor,
what is the natural inference from that? There must be something in the
state of manufacturing circumstances to hinder the people from being
poor, or something in the state of agricultural Edition: current; Page:
[863] circumstances to make them so. We have heard much lately, from the
Protectionists, of the baneful influence of manufactures upon the
labouring classes.2 We have been told that manufacturing employment
makes them purchase a year or two of high wages and overwork, at the
price of perhaps several years of idleness and starvation. If this be
so, the average amount of poor rates and of paupers in the agricultural
and manufacturing provinces and parishes must bear witness to it. Let
not “agriculture” shrink from the test. A chacun selon ses oeuvres.3 Let
manufactures support the paupers they make. They already do so. They do
not ask agriculture to support their poor. On the contrary, they support
great numbers of those who by birth belong to agriculture. During the
interval between the last census and that which preceded it, the whole
population of the country increased largely. The agricultural population
did not increase at all.4 During those ten years the whole excess of
births over deaths in the agricultural districts had been taken and
provided for by the towns. Had it not been for manufactures, these
additional numbers, if born at all, must have perished in infancy, or
remained—not to lower wages, for that, in Wiltshire and Somersetshire,
they could not have done, but to increase the poor rates. In this
adjustment of the burthen between town and country, it seems strange
that it should be the country that complains; yet the landlords are of
opinion that to support part of their own poor is to do more than their
share, and that the towns do not help them enough. Such a mode of
thinking, if it were found among any class but that of the spoiled
children of society, would be deemed rather presumptuous.

Their complaint derives its only semblance of a foundation from a matter
of formal technicality, immaterial to the pecuniary result in most
cases, and which, in the few instances in which it has any substantial
effect, there would probably be no indisposition to alter. The poor
rate, as all know, is levied from the occupiers of land and houses, by
an assessment proportioned to the rent which they pay, or which it is
supposed could fairly be demanded from them.5 Now, the occupiers in
towns are rated only on the amount of their house rent; the farmers are
rated also on the rent of their lands, which, the agriculturists say
(and in so far they say truly) is equivalent to rating the landlord. So
that the landlord, Edition: current; Page: [864] besides paying poor
rate, like other people, on the house which he inhabits, is also rated,
indirectly, on the whole income from his land, which comes to him
reduced by the poor rate that has been paid by all his various tenants.

This is substantially true, and would amount to a real grievance if the
poor rate were a national, instead of a local impost. Were the poor of
the nation supported by the funds of the nation (not the poor of the
parish by the funds of the parish), it would be very unjust to the
landlords to raise those funds in the present mode of assessment. But
the rate is a local rate, and long may it continue so. Were it made
national, the owners of the soil would cease to have even the weak and
insufficient personal interest they now have in checking the inroads of
pauperism. So long, then, as each parish supports its own poor, the
nominal injustice of the present mode of rating seldom comes into any
practical effect. Almost all parishes are practically either entirely
town parishes, or entirely agricultural. An agricultural parish may
contain a large village, or a small country town; but the rateable
income of the parish is even then almost wholly agricultural; much of
the property in the town or village belongs to the neighbouring
landowners, the remainder is mostly in small portions, and could pay but
little, and the landowners are more than indemnified by the low rating
of their own “castles” and “halls,” which (as is well known to those who
remember the discussions on the house-tax)6 are assessed on the rent
which a tenant could be found to give for them, that is, about a ninth
or a tenth of their real value (the interest of their cost price).

The cases in which the unequal principle of assessment to the poor rate
really operates with injustice are peculiar and exceptional, being
chiefly those in which a parish, otherwise agricultural, contains here
and there a cotton-mill or other factory. There is in these cases a real
unfairness, as between the millowner and the landowner. The one is rated
only on the annual value of his buildings, the other virtually on his
whole estate. This is an inequality which unquestionably calls for
redress, locally, or generally. Redress might be given in two ways.
Neither is free from objections, but to neither, perhaps, would the
objections be unconquerable. The millowner might submit to be assessed
to the poor rate, as he already is to the income tax, on the entire
profits of his trade; or if this would be deemed unendurable, the rating
of lands might be abandoned, and the assessment, either in certain
parishes or universally, might be made on dwelling houses only. This
would amount to levying the poor rate by a house tax, which, if
impartially assessed, without the favour formerly shown to the class
least entitled to it, is one of the best forms of taxation, approaching
nearer than almost any other to a perfectly just income tax, without its
inquisitorial character. But on these things it will be time to enlarge
further when the time comes for considering them with a view to
practical effect.

303.: THE ACQUITTAL OF CAPTAIN JOHNSTONE
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 10 FEB., 1846, P. 5

Captain George Johnstone (b. 1812), of the ship Tory, was brought to
trial at the Central Criminal Court on 5 Feb., 1846, charged with the
brutal murders of three seamen under his command during a return voyage
from China. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Captain
Johnstone not guilty because of temporary insanity. The case was
reported at length in the Morning Chronicle, 6 Feb., pp. 7-8, and 7
Feb., p. 7, and in The Times, 6 Feb., p. 7, and 7 Feb., p. 8. This
unheaded leader is the first of a series (see Nos. 305, 307, 318, 329,
350, 383, 389-90, 392-6, and 400) of leading articles and letters to the
editor on cases of injustice and cruelty that Harriet Taylor coauthored
with Mill; it is also the first of any of his writings to be described
as “a joint production” with her (though she is not named) in his
bibliography, where the entry reads: “A leading article on the acquittal
of Capt. Johnstone of the ‘[Tory]’ in the Morning Chronicle of 10th
February 1846 a joint production—very little of which was mine”

(MacMinn, p. 59).

if the jury who have just acquitted the most atrocious criminal who has
been brought to answer for his misdeeds at the bar of a court of justice
for many years, had studied how they could bring the administration of
justice most effectually into contempt—if they had meant to show what a
wretched exhibition of human imbecility jury trial might be made, when
carried on by men with neither heart nor intellect, and in whom maudlin
weakness and moral poltroonery stand in the place of conscience—they
could not have succeeded more completely. A man who has realized almost
fabulous atrocities—who has made the metaphorical expression of “killing
by inches” a physical fact—who, being placed in authority over a number
of men, at a distance from all legal protection, after exhausting
ordinary tyrannies, crowned a series of horrors by literally hewing in
pieces two human beings, bound and unresisting—this man has been
declared “not guilty,” for no other cause whatever but the excess of his
guilt, for it is not even pretended that he had shown any marks of
insanity, or exhibited any of the characteristics of it, except the
crimes which have been proved.

With regard to the wretched culprit himself, we have only now to look to
the advisers of the Crown, and trust that he will be treated for the
remainder of his life as the most dangerous kind of lunatic, and will
not, at the easy price of a temporary confinement, be again let loose
upon the world. But there is a lesson to be learnt from this verdict.
The state of mind of the jurors is a specimen of the tendency of the
humanity-mongering which has succeeded to the reckless brutality of our
old laws, and which has brought us to such a pass, that every man is now
to be presumed insane as soon as it is fully proved that he is a
ruffian.

Burke, long ago, spoke of the “credulous morality” of a certain kind of
people, who, when a man acts like a villain, never have the courage to
think him one.1 If jurors think every man insane whom they acquit as
such, this credulous Edition: current; Page: [866] morality has made
wonderful progress. The maxim so well expressed by our contemporary the
Times, in an admirable article on Saturday, that “a crime without a
motive is no crime at all,”2 might now be inscribed over the door of
every court of justice, as the creed of fools and the motto of juries.
And a motive must be something which would be a motive to the juryman
himself, or to people like himself—people who never framed a thought,
had a feeling, or did an act different from everybody else. Time was
when it was not thought incredible and miraculous not to be commonplace.
But the modern type of civilization has so destroyed even the
remembrance, even the idea, of individuality, that to the vulgar
everything which shows character is a proof of madness. The conduct of
the man Johnstone did show character. It showed a man not exactly like
all other people. It showed a ruffian, but it showed a man to whom
custom was not the law of his life. This is as much as it is generally
necessary to prove before a Commission of Lunacy. If the man had been as
much better than other people as he was worse, and had shaped his life
by his own inclinations, instead of by the doings and sayings of his
neighbours, let the reader ask himself, if any one had an interest in
proving him mad, how much chance he would have had of escaping a
madhouse in the hands of such a jury?

The only murders which men need now expect to be punished for, are those
which are committed for money, or from fear of exposure. These are
motives, the reasonableness of which appears to be recognized. These
inducements are considered by juries as capable of acting upon a sane
man. They are, no doubt, the motives to most of the crimes of the age.
The motives of great criminals—the vehement resentment, the bitter
revenge, the determined self-will, the superstitious horror, the intense
antipathy—are things which jurors have nothing corresponding with in
themselves, and cannot recognize when before their eyes.

We have given the jurors the benefit of the supposition most favourable
to them—that they are as great fools as they proclaim themselves. We
have supposed that they really thought the man insane. If they did not
think so, but were influenced by a mawkish dislike to having on their
consciences the death of a man who had inflicted so many deaths, what
are we to think of them? A morbid feebleness of conscience is in our
time so common an accompaniment of other mental feebleness, that the
supposition is by no means improbable. In the words of the Times “the
contest lies between their judgment and their honour.” We do not add,
with our contemporary, “we will not suppose it to be the latter.”3 We
leave them to the alternative.

304.: GROTE’S HISTORY OF GREECE [1]
 SPECTATOR, 4 APR., 1846, PP. 327-8

As early as 1823 George Grote, by then an intimate of James Mill and a
friend to his younger contemporary, John, had begun work on what was to
become his “opus magnum” (as J.S. Mill called it early in its
gestation), the History of Greece, 12 vols. (London: Murray, 1846-56).
He laid it aside for a decade after his election as M.P. for the City of
London in 1832, but resumed it after leaving the Commons in 1841, and by
1843, having also retired from the family bank, was hard at work on the
first two volumes. They appeared in 1846, and ten other volumes appeared
at intervals until 1856. Mill, who had followed in manuscript at least
the early stages of its composition, reviewed the volumes at various
stages in their publication: for the Spectator in 1846 he wrote this
notice of the first two volumes, in 1847 one of Vols. III and IV (No.
368), in 1849 two of Vols. V and VI (Nos. 380 and 381), and in 1850 one
of Vols. VII and VIII (No. 391). He also wrote two major reviews for the
Edinburgh: in 1846, of Vols. I and II; and, in 1853, of Vols. IX-XI. For
a discussion of Grote’s History and Mill’s responses to it, see CW, Vol.
XI (where the two Edinburgh reviews appear), pp. xxviii-xlv and
lxxxvi-lxxxix. Though Mill did not incorporate passages from the
Spectator review of April 1846 into the Edinburgh one of October 1846,
the two have similar structures, many passages are parallel, and there
is considerable overlap in the references. In a letter to Harriet Grote
of 1 Apr., 1846, Mill remarks on the length of this article, continuing,
“I have taken my extracts from the 2nd vol., which has not yet been
quoted, I believe, people not having had time to master it. You will see
by the article that I like it very much. I was excessively sorry when I
got to the end of it, and am impatient for the next volume.” (EL, CW,
Vol. XIII, p. 699.) This review, in the “Spectator’s Library” section,
headed as title, is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A notice of the
first two volumes of Grote’s History of Greece in the Spectator of 4th
April 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 59).

mr. grote’s is the first attempt at a philosophical history of Greece.
Much as has been done for history in general by German and French
writers, we are not aware that Grecian history (except, indeed, that of
Grecian literature and art) owes anything to them save antiquarian
researches and dissertations; most valuable, it is true, but only as
materials for the historian. Our own country has produced two Histories
of Greece, which have obtained a certain share of celebrity; Mitford’s,
and Bishop Thirlwall’s.1 But Mitford’s narrative, written and published
during the wildest height of Antijacobin phrensy,2 is vitiated by an
intensity of prejudice against whatever bears the name or semblance of
popular institutions, which renders his representation of Grecian
phaenomena not only false, but in many Edition: current; Page: [868]
particulars the direct contrary of the truth. Athenian institutions, and
the great Athenian people, to whom mankind owe a debt such as they owe
to no other assemblage of men that ever existed, are studiously degraded
by imputing to them not only the faults they really had, but those from
which all the monuments of the time conspire to prove that they were
peculiarly and preëminently exempt. On the other hand, every creature,
however base, who has the single merit in Mr. Mitford’s eyes of
possessing despotic power, holds from him a patent of acquittal from all
offences ever charged upon him, by whatever weight of testimony. With
Mr. Mitford, a vulgar Asiatic Sultan like Xerxes, an unprincipled
usurper and tyrant like Dionysius, are specimens of calumniated
innocence, Philip of Macedon a pattern of enlightened and kingly
virtue;3 while the characters against whom his vituperation is poured
out, are a Pericles, a Timoleon,4 a Demosthenes. Besides being saturated
with this spirit, the wretched scholarship of the book would have
secured its condemnation in a country like Germany, of real learning,
though in this country of merely pretended learning it obtained on this
score a high reputation, which has even yet not wholly abandoned it.

Dr. Thirlwall’s performance is the work of a thorough scholar,
accurately versed in his subject, and entirely free from the prejudices
and biases of Mitford. Many of that writer’s misrepresentations he has,
though in general silently and always unostentatiously, rectified; and
the work altogether is that of an upright, fair, and perfectly impartial
narrator. We mean no disrespect when we say that it is not, in a
corresponding degree, the production of a thinker. The character of Dr.
Thirlwall’s mind has not led him to speculate much, or with any clear
and positive result, on the phaenomena of political society. Even his
impartiality seems rather that of a person who has no opinion, than of
one who has an unbiased opinion. We do not say that an author is to
write history with a purpose of bringing out illustrations of his own
moral and political doctrines, however correct they may be. He cannot
too carefully guard himself against any such temptation. If he yield to
it, he becomes an unfaithful historian. If not led to pervert the
history, he is led to exhibit in disproportionate relief some particular
features of it. But we do say, that the mere facts, even of the most
interesting history, are of little value without some attempt to show
how and why they came to pass; that a mere narrative of events, without
the causes and agencies which Edition: current; Page: [869] gave them
birth—a history of Greece, which does not put in evidence the influences
of Grecian institutions and of Grecian opinions and feelings—may be a
useful work, but is not the history which we look for, and are entitled
to demand.

Mr. Grote, with equal scholarship to Dr. Thirlwall, and a degree of
sympathy with the Greek mind, which some, perhaps, might not have
expected from him, has aimed at supplying this grand deficiency, and
combining with the interest of the facts themselves, that deeper
interest which is only excited when the reader is not merely told the
facts but made to understand them. And we already need not hesitate to
prophesy, that he will produce a work as much superior in value and
merit to Dr. Thirlwall’s as his to Mitford’s. A very small portion of
the task is yet performed: he has dealt as yet only with the legends of
Greece, and the first dawn of its authentic history; where no
consecutive stream of narrative is possible, and the main part of the
historian’s business must consist of the discussion of evidence. A
writer cannot be put to a severer trial. The most attractive graces of
historical composition he has in this stage of the work little or no
opportunity of displaying, while his power of rendering his subject
interesting is more hardly tasked than in any subsequent part of his
progress. But Mr. Grote has stood the test. The reader will find that
the discussions about historical evidence have an interest he scarcely
expects. The reason is, that principles are evolved in them. They are
not special pleadings about this, that, or the other fragment of
testimony. They involve great questions respecting the credibility of
tradition and the origin of historical beliefs; and by implication, many
important laws of human intellect, and many leading characteristics of
the Greek mind.

In the complete separation which he makes between Legend and History,5
Mr. Grote is of the school of Niebuhr; if that can be called a school
which now comprehends all thinkers. But he arrives at similar
conclusions by a path of his own. Niebuhr holds that the early stories
of Rome are not history, but poetry.6 Mr. Grote holds those of Greece to
be not history, but religion as well as poetry. Homer and Hesiod7 were
as much the religious books of the early Greeks, and of the general
Grecian public down to a late period, as the Puranas are those of the
Hindoos, or even as the Mosaic records were of the Jews. The inspiration
of the muse was not in those days a commonplace metaphor. The muse was a
real goddess, and the poems were her revelations. Even in the times of
Herodotus,8 Thucydides, and Plato, they were the acknowledged
authorities on all divine things.

Edition: current; Page: [870]
Mr. Grote relates the more important legends in considerable detail;
those of the gods, as well as those of the heroes and the heroic age. He
places them exactly on a par. He no more thinks that the latter had any
historical foundation than that the former had. Both rested on the same
evidence, that of the poets or bards. Both are blended together in
inextricable union. The stories of the heroes are equally supernatural
with those of the gods; and equally a part of religion, the gods being
not only always mixed up in them, but the heroes themselves being
objects of religious worship. Both were believed with equal implicitness
by the hearers, and formed together the body of belief in the mind of a
Greek, concerning the origin of the world and of himself, and the nature
of the divine government. Some of the heroes may be real personages,
some of the events recounted may be real events; but the poems not only
do not amount to proof of this, they are not even any evidence of it.
If, indeed, there were chiefs in those days who left an enduring name
behind them, legends were likely to attach themselves to those names.
But even then, the facts recounted may have had no more reference to
anything which really happened, than the real exploits of Charlemagne
had to the events related of him by Archbishop Turpin, whose Chronicle
was also accepted as true history, and pronounced to be such by Pope
Calixtus II.9 The idea of rejecting everything supernatural and
everything extraordinary and romantic in the legends, under the name of
poetic ornament, and preserving the dull caput mortuum as a residuum of
historical truth, to be believed on no other evidence than we have for
the entire story, Mr. Grote shows to have been a fancy of historians and
philosophers of a later age—a kind of Rationalists, unwilling or unable
altogether to break with the faith of their fathers, though all the more
characteristic and impressive facts of it had become repugnant to the
altered tone of their minds. Our space prevents us from giving a
specimen of the accumulated argument and evidence by which Mr. Grote, we
think irresistibly, enforces this conclusion. We would refer especially
to the last two chapters of the first volume, and the second chapter of
volume second. For centuries, as he remarks, the history of England was
supposed to begin with Brute the Trojan, and was continued through a
succession of monarchs down to Julius Caesar;10 the very dates of their
accessions being fixed by chronologists. Hardying, Fabyan, Grafton, and
Hollinshed,11 all the old chroniclers, believed Edition: current; Page:
[871] those tales; and jurists argued on them as undoubtedly historical.
The evidence for them was similar to that of the Grecian legends, except
that they were not protected against gainsayers by connexion with
religion. Hector, Priam, and the Atridae, have, in Mr. Grote’s
estimation, precisely the same claim to be considered historical
characters as Lear and Locrine. Hercules is at once a god like Zeus and
a romantic hero like Amadis de Gaul.12

A chapter is devoted to the delineation of the state of society shown in
the Homeric and Hesiodic poems. Another relates to the much-agitated
subject of the origin of the Homeric poems themselves. Are they, or is
either of them, the work of a single author? Was their original state
essentially that in which we now find them? Or are they, according to
the bold hypothesis of Wolf and his followers, a compilation made in the
times of Pisistratus from the ballads of a preceding age?13 Mr. Grote
has, we think, completed the overthrow of the Wolfian paradox. His own
theory differs much less from the traditional notion of all antiquity:
where it does differ, it is at least plausible, and ingeniously and
forcibly supported.

Mr. Grote dates the small beginnings of authentic history from the first
recorded Olympiad, 776 bc In recounting it he has yet made small
progress; having only been able to include the history of Sparta and the
Peloponnesian Dorians, down to the age of Pisistratus and Croesus.14 Of
this the most interesting feature is the legislation of Lycurgus,15 the
subject of one of his largest and most important chapters.

Mr. Grote does not consider Lycurgus to be, like Numa,16 a fabulous
character; though scarcely any facts can be authentically ascertained
concerning him. But there is no doubt that the institutions ascribed to
him are of great antiquity, considerably anterior to the first Olympiad;
and that they were believed to have been established by one man, on whom
the Lacedaemonians conferred the power of legislation, to rescue them
from a previous state of intolerable disorder. The institutions lasted
in considerable vigour for several centuries, and were the cause of the
power and eminence which Sparta attained. Edition: current; Page: [872]
Even, however, with such a fact as this, the mythic element is
strikingly blended. The tale, which has been universally received on the
authority of Plutarch, that Lycurgus redivided the land into equal
portions,17—or, indeed, that equality of property was part of the
institutions of Lacedaemon at any time,—Mr. Grote cannot find any early
authority for; it is inconsistent with the testimony we have from
Aristotle,18 and other writers of the best age of Greece; and Mr. Grote
believes it to date no higher than the time of Agis and Cleomenes,19
after the Lycurgean institutions had virtually ceased to exist. We
quote, as an exposition of the author’s ideas and a specimen of his
style, a part of his observations on this point.

The present is not the occasion to enter at length into that combination
of causes which partly sapped, partly overthrew, both the institutions
of Lycurgus and the power of Sparta; but, taking the condition of that
city as it stood in the time of Agis III (say about 250 bc), we know
that its citizens had become few in number, the bulk of them miserably
poor, and all the land in a small number of hands—the old discipline and
the public mess (as far as the rich were concerned) degenerated into
mere forms—a numerous body of strangers or non-citizens (the old
xenêlasy, or prohibition of resident strangers, being long discontinued)
domiciled in the town, and forming a powerful moneyed interest; and
lastly, the dignity and ascendency of the state amongst its neighbours
altogether ruined. It was unsupportable to a young enthusiast like King
Agis, and to many ardent spirits among his contemporaries, to contrast
this degradation with the previous glories of their country; and they
saw no other way of reconstructing the old Sparta except by again
admitting the disfranchised poor citizens, redividing the lands,
cancelling all debts, and restoring the public mess and military
training in all their strictness. Agis endeavoured to carry through
these subversive measures, (such as no demagogue in the extreme
democracy of Athens would ever have ventured to glance at,) with the
consent of the senate and public assembly, and the acquiescence of the
rich. His sincerity is attested by the fact, that his own property, and
that of his female relatives, among the largest in the state, was cast
as the first sacrifice into the common stock. But he became the dupe of
unprincipled coadjutors, and perished in the unavailing attempt to
realize his scheme by persuasion. His successor Kleomenês afterwards
accomplished by violence a change substantially similar, though the
intervention of foreign arms speedily overthrew both himself and his
institutions.

Now it was under the state of public feeling which gave birth to these
projects of Agis and Kleomenês at Sparta, that the historic fancy,
unknown to Aristotle and his predecessors, first gained ground, of the
absolute equality of property as a primitive institution of Lycurgus.
How much such a belief would favour the schemes of innovation, is too
obvious to require notice; and, without supposing any deliberate
imposture, we cannot be astonished that the predispositions of
enthusiastic patriots interpreted according to their own partialities an
old unrecorded legislation from which they were separated by more than
five centuries. The Lycurgean discipline tended forcibly to suggest to
men’s Edition: current; Page: [873] minds the idea of equality among the
citizens,—that is, the negation of inequality not founded on some
personal attribute—inasmuch as it assimilated the habits, enjoyments,
and capacities of the rich to those of the poor; and the equality thus
existing in idea and tendency, which seemed to proclaim the wish of the
founder, was strained by the later reformers into a positive institution
which he had at first realized, but from which his degenerate followers
had receded. It was thus that the fancies, longings, and indirect
suggestions of the present assumed the character of recollections out of
the early, obscure, and extinct historical past. Perhaps the philosopher
Sphaerus20 of Borysthenês, (the friend and companion of Kleomenês and
the disciple of Zeno the Stoic,) author of works now lost both on
Lycurgus and Socrates and on the constitution of Sparta, may have been
one of those who gave currency to such an hypothesis; and we shall
readily believe that, if advanced, it would find easy and sincere
credence, when we recollect how many similar delusions have obtained
vogue in modern times far more favourable to historical accuracy—how
much false colouring has been attached by the political feeling of
recent days to matters of ancient history, such as the Saxon
Wittenagemote, the Great Charter, the rise and growth of the English
House of Commons, or even the Poor-law of Elizabeth.

[Vol. II, pp. 527-30.]

The real peculiarity of the Spartan institutions was not equality of
property, but the equal subjection of rich and poor to the most rigidly
ascetic form of the discipline of a camp. And the Spartan character was
the joint product of this rigid discipline and of the peculiar position
of the Spartan community, encamped as it were in the midst of a numerous
body of Helots, who (unlike the purchased slaves of other Grecian
states) were Greeks, and warlike as themselves; and from whom their
supremacy and safety were always in imminent danger. These things, and
many others not less interesting, are amply set forth in this excellent
chapter; of which it is saying little to affirm, that it places the
Spartan constitution and the general physiognomy of the Lacedaemonian
community in a clearer light than they ever were placed in before.

The chapter on “the Hellenic People generally, in the early historical
times,” is also of great interest [Pt. II, Chap. ii; Vol. II, pp.
311-56]: but we prefer quoting the observations on the influence of the
geographical characteristics of Greece upon its history.

The configuration of the Grecian territory, so like in many respects to
that of Switzerland, produced two effects of great moment upon the
character and history of the people. In the first place, it materially
strengthened their powers of defence: it shut up the country against
those invasions from the interior which successively subjugated all
their continental colonies; and it at the same time rendered each
fraction more difficult to be attacked by the rest, so as to exercise a
certain conservative influence in assuring the tenure of actual
possessors: for the pass of Thermopylae between Thessaly and Phocis,
that of Kithaerôn between Boeotia and Attica, or the mountainous range
of Oneion and Geraneia along the Isthmus of Corinth, were positions
which an inferior number of brave men could hold against a much greater
force of assailants. But, in the next place, while it tended to protect
each section of Greeks from being conquered, it also kept them Edition:
current; Page: [874] politically disunited and perpetuated their
separate autonomy. It fostered that powerful principle of repulsion,
which disposed even the smallest township to constitute itself a
political unit apart from the rest, and to resist all idea of
coalescence with others, either amicable or compulsory. To a modern
reader, accustomed to large political aggregations, and securities for
good government through the representative system, it requires a certain
mental effort to transport himself back to a time when even the smallest
town clung so tenaciously to its right of self-legislation. Nevertheless
such was the general habit and feeling of the ancient world, throughout
Italy, Sicily, Spain, and Gaul: among the Hellenes it stands out more
conspicuously, for several reasons—first, because they seem to have
pushed the multiplication of autonomous units to an extreme point,
seeing that even islands not larger than Peparêthos and Amorgos had two
or three separate city communities; secondly, because they produced, for
the first time in the history of mankind, acute systematic thinkers on
matters of government, amongst all of whom the idea of the autonomous
city was accepted as the indispensable basis of political speculation;
thirdly, because this incurable subdivision proved finally the cause of
their ruin, in spite of pronounced intellectual superiority over their
conquerors; and lastly, because incapacity of political coalescence did
not preclude a powerful and extensive sympathy between the inhabitants
of all the separate cities, with a constant tendency to fraternise for
numerous purposes, social, religious, recreative, intellectual, and
aesthetical. For these reasons, the indefinite multiplication of
self-governing towns, though in truth a phaenomenon common to ancient
Europe as contrasted with the large monarchies of Asia, appears more
marked among the ancient Greeks than elsewhere: and there cannot be any
doubt that they owe it, in a considerable degree, to the multitude of
insulating boundaries which the configuration of their country
presented.

Nor is it rash to suppose that the same causes may have tended to
promote that unborrowed intellectual development for which they stand so
conspicuous. General propositions respecting the working of climate and
physical agencies upon character are indeed treacherous; for our
knowledge of the globe is now sufficient to teach us that heat and cold,
mountain and plain, sea and land, moist and dry atmosphere, are all
consistent with the greatest diversities of resident men: moreover, the
contrast between the population of Greece itself, for the seven
centuries preceding the Christian aera, and the Greeks of more modern
times, is alone enough to inculcate reserve in such speculations.
Nevertheless, we may venture to note certain improving influences,
connected with their geographical position, at a time when they had no
books to study, and no more advanced predecessors to imitate. We may
remark, first, that their position made them at once mountaineers and
mariners, thus supplying them with great variety of objects, sensations,
and adventures; next, that each petty community, nestled apart amidst
its own rocks, was sufficiently severed from the rest to possess an
individual life and attributes of its own, yet not so far as to subtract
it from the sympathies of the remainder; so that an observant Greek,
commercing with a great diversity of half-countrymen, whose language he
understood, and whose idiosyncracies he could appreciate, had access to
a larger mass of social and political experience than any other man in
so unadvanced an age could personally obtain. The Phoenician, superior
to the Greek on ship-board, traversed wider distances and saw a greater
number of strangers, but he had not the same means of intimate communion
with a multiplicity of fellows in blood and language: his relations,
confined to purchase and sale, did not comprise that mutuality of action
and reaction which pervaded the crowd at a Grecian festival. The scene
which here presented itself was a mixture of uniformity and variety
highly stimulating to the observant faculties of a man of genius,—who at
the same time, if he sought to communicate his own impressions, or to
act upon this mingled and diverse audience, was forced to shake off what
was peculiar Edition: current; Page: [875] to his own town or community,
and to put forth matter in harmony with the feelings of all. It is thus
that we may explain in part that penetrating apprehension of human life
and character, and that power of touching sympathies common to all ages
and nations, which surprises us so much in the unlettered authors of the
old epic. Such periodical intercommunion of brethren habitually isolated
from each other, was the only means then open of procuring for the bard
a diversified range of experience and a many-coloured audience; and it
was to a great degree the result of geographical causes. Perhaps among
other nations such facilitating causes might have been found, yet
without producing any result comparable to the Iliad and Odyssey; but
Homer was nevertheless dependent upon the conditions of his age, and we
can at least point out those peculiarities in early Grecian society
without which Homeric excellence would never have existed,—the
geographical position is one, the language another.

[Vol. II, pp. 298-302.]

Mr. Grote expects to complete the History in eight volumes; of which the
third, and perhaps the fourth, will appear in the course of the next
winter.


305.: DR. ELLIS’S CONVICTION
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 13 JUNE, 1846, P. 6

As Mill indicates in his opening sentence, the Morning Chronicle had
published on 6 June, 1846, p. 7, a report of the coroner’s inquest on 5
June into the death of Richard Dresser, an accountant, aged forty-five,
after treatment by James Ellis (ca. 1802-81), a practitioner of
hydrotherapy. On 9 June a verdict of manslaughter was returned against
Ellis (Morning Chronicle, 10 June, p. 5), but when tried on 20 June at
the Central Criminal Court he was acquitted (Morning Chronicle and The
Times, both 22 June, p. 7). This unheaded leader is the second of those
on injustice and cruelty written by Harriet Taylor and Mill (see No.
303). It is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A leading article on a
verdict of manslaughter against a hydropathic practitioner in the
Morning Chronicle of 13th June 1846, very little of this was mine”

(MacMinn, p. 59).

our paper, a day or two since, contained a report of proceedings before
a coroner’s jury, terminating in a verdict of manslaughter against Dr.
Ellis, the superintendent of the Hydropathic establishment at Sudbroke
Park, Petersham, on account of the death of a patient, a Mr. Richard
Dresser, who died on Tuesday, having been under the care of Dr. Ellis
since the preceding Friday.

The case, in consequence of this verdict, will necessarily undergo
investigation before a criminal tribunal; but to be put upon trial, even
if acquitted, is so serious an injury and grievance to an innocent
person, that it is worthy of deliberate consideration, both how far
medical practitioners ought to be subject to such responsibility, and
whether it has been judiciously applied to a case like the present.

The jury, of twelve, we dare say, respectable petty tradesmen, but not
likely to be very enlightened critics of medical skill, have by this
verdict pronounced a solemn opinion on two grave and difficult medical
questions. They have decided Edition: current; Page: [876] that the
patient died in consequence of Dr. Ellis’s treatment, and that the error
committed—assuming it to be an error—was of so culpable a kind as to
constitute, in the eye of the law, a punishable offence.

They did not, of course, adopt these serious conclusions on their own
knowledge, but on the faith of medical evidence. The professional
witnesses in the case were two surgeons practising in partnership in the
Kent-road—a circumstance not inconsistent with consummate medical skill,
but which assuredly affords no guarantee of it.1 These surgeons had
examined the body after death, by the desire of the family, but without
the knowledge or presence, so far as appeared, of Dr. Ellis, or of any
one in his behalf. We hope, however, that it is still in his power to
cause a re-examination of a more public kind, if he judges it desirable.
Dr. Ellis, not having examined the body, gave as his opinion that the
death was occasioned by diseased liver. The surgeons, after examination,
say that the liver was not diseased. They do not agree with each other
on all points, one thinking the liver congested, while the other “hardly
ever saw a healthier liver in his life.”2 They both say, however, that
the heart and lungs were congested, that they could find no other cause
of death, and that this excessive congestion must have been produced by
the very mild application of tepid (for it was not even cold) water
which appears to have been used. They say besides, that if the liver had
been diseased, the hydropathic treatment would have been extremely
inappropriate; in which Dr. Ellis concurs, since he said that if he had
known the liver to be affected he would not have received the patient.
The only ailment which the deceased complained of was rheumatism, or
sciatica. An extraordinary circumstance is, that on the showing of the
two surgeons there was nothing to account for death from so slight a
cause. They were asked no questions about the patient’s previous state
of health; though one of them said that he had known and attended him
for years. The only fact they stated was, that the action of the heart
was feeble. But a feeble action of the heart is not enough to make a man
die of suffocation from being fomented with tepid water. A man whom that
would kill must have been at death’s door first. Was it so unpardonable
an oversight in Dr. Ellis not to suspect such a condition in a man who
complained of nothing worse than rheumatic pains? It must be remembered,
too, that these professional men (we mean it not as an imputation, but
as a presumption, which justice requires to be taken into account) were
in all human probability strongly prepossessed both against the
irregular practice, and against the irregular practitioner; a sentiment,
which the patient having quitted their care to place himself under that
of Dr. Ellis, was nowise calculated to mollify.

It is by no means a clear case, that in a free country medical men
should ever be criminally responsible for the consequences of bonâ fide
treatment; or that a Edition: current; Page: [877] person of full age
and reasonable understanding, who, with his eyes open, places himself
under the care of a practitioner, should not do it at his own risk. It
is a question on both sides of which much still remains to be said. But
there are weighty reasons to be urged for the responsibility in some
other cases, which cannot be applicable to this. A quack may pretend to
be acquainted with the whole medical art, and competent to apply all its
expedients, each in its proper place. But Dr. Ellis and his compeers
profess nothing but hydropathy, practice nothing but hydropathy, do not
pretend to judge of anything but hydropathy. Whoever submits himself to
them does so because he believes in hydropathy. He knows what he is
about, and acts not from faith in the doctor, but from faith in the
treatment itself, and in its applicability to his case; and neither is
hydropathy a thing of palpable fraud, the bare profession of which can
be treated as an attempt to deceive. In its immense pretensions, or in
those which have sometimes been made for it, we place no credence
whatever; but its occasional efficacy is admitted by all, and the most
scientific physicians often advise patients, in obstinate cases, to
place themselves in one of these very establishments. All depends on
judging rightly of the cases to which it is suited, and in that the most
instructed physician may err, as well as the most ignorant.

The law of the case was fairly enough laid down by the coroner. He said
that the jury had nothing to do with Dr. Ellis’s being or not being a
regularly licensed practitioner; that they had only to consider if there
was proof of gross negligence or incompetence.3 But if thinking that a
person has a liver complaint when he has not, is negligence or
ignorance, deserving the penalties of manslaughter; thinking that a
lady, whose lamentable case ought never to be forgotten, had not a liver
complaint, when she was dying of it, does not seem to fall far short of
the same criminality. Yet that was the mistake of one of the most
instructed and really ablest men in the medical profession.4

The diagnostics of liver disease are proverbially uncertain; to say
nothing of the general uncertainty and almost infant state of the
medical art. And shall twelve Surrey tradesmen rush in where the best
and most acknowledged authorities tread unsafely? Is it for them to take
upon themselves the right of punishing the practitioners of the most
fallible of all useful arts for not being infallible?

October 1846 to June 1847


306.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [1]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 5 OCT., 1846, P. 4

The disastrous failure of the potato crop, which brought on the terrible
Irish famine, called attention anew to the agricultural and general
economic problems in Ireland, and brought forward various proposals to
improve conditions. In a series of forty-three leading articles in the
Morning Chronicle, running until 7 Jan., 1847, of which this is the
first, Mill develops the views that (using these articles) he presents
in his Principles of Political Economy. In his Autobiography, saying
that he began the Principles in the autumn of 1845 and had the work
ready for the press before the end of 1847, he comments: “In this period
of little more than two years there was an interval of six months during
which the work was laid aside, while I was writing articles in the
Morning Chronicle (which unexpectedly entered warmly into my purpose)
urging the formation of peasant properties on the waste lands of
Ireland. This was during the period of the famine, the winter of
1846/47, when the stern necessities of the time seemed to afford a
chance of gaining attention for what appeared to me the only mode of
combining relief to immediate destitution with permanent improvement of
the social and economical condition of the Irish people. But the idea
was new and strange; there was no English precedent for such a
proceeding: and the profound ignorance of English politicians and the
English public concerning all social phenomena not generally met with in
England (however common elsewhere) made my endeavours an entire failure.
Instead of a great operation on the waste lands, and the conversion of
cottiers into proprietors, Parliament passed a Poor Law for maintaining
them as paupers: and if the nation has not since found itself in
inextricable difficulties from the joint operation of the old evils and
the quack remedy, it is indebted for its deliverance to that most
unexpected and surprising fact, the depopulation of Ireland, commenced
by famine, and continued by emigration.” (CW, Vol. I, p. 243; see also
Mill’s letter to Harriet Taylor, ca. 30 Mar., 1849; LL, CW, Vol. XIV, p.
21.) Given the labour that must have gone into this series, and noting
that he wrote six further leaders on Ireland in the Morning Chronicle,
the last appearing on 7 Apr., 1847, one may well understand Mill’s
saying there was a six-months’ interval, when in fact the series lasted
for three months. He was pleased with the initial reception of his
ideas, writing to Bain (probably in mid-November, 1846) to say that the
articles “have excited a good deal of notice, and have quite snatched
the initiative out of the Times.” “It is a capital thing to have the
power of writing leaders in the Chronicle whenever I like, which I can
always do. The paper has tried for years to get me to write to it, but
it has not suited me to do it before, except once in six months or so.”
In another letter to Bain, on 28 Dec., he reports that he may “slacken”
his writing on the subject, “having in a great measure, as far as may be
judged by appearances, carried my point, viz., to have the waste lands
reclaimed and parcelled out in small properties among the best of the
peasantry” (EL, CW, Vol. XIII, p. 705). The unheaded leader is described
in his bibliography as “A leading article on Irish affairs in the
Morning Chronicle of 5th October 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 60).

Edition: current; Page: [880]
the present condition of ireland, in the midst of its danger and
calamity, has that element of consolation which proverbially accompanies
an intolerable excess of evil. It has brought things to a crisis. It has
converted a chronic into an acute disease, which will either kill or be
cured. It has made that singular state of society, which in Ireland is
called law, property, and social order, simply a thing which cannot any
longer hold together. The sluggish, well-meaning mind of the English
nation, so willing to do its duty, so slow to discover that it has any
duty to do, is now perforce rousing to ask itself the question, after
five centuries of English domination over Ireland, how many millions it
is inclined to pay, not in order to save the social system which has
grown up under its fostering care, but to help that precious child of
its parental nurture to die easy? Any further prolongation of existence
for that system no one now seems to predict, and hardly any one any
longer ventures to insinuate that it deserves.

This is something gained. The state of Ireland—not the present state
merely, but the habitual state—is hitherto the most unqualified instance
of signal failure which the practical genius of the English people has
exhibited. We have had the Irish all to ourselves, for five hundred
years. No one has shared with us the privilege of governing them, nor
the responsibilities consequent on that privilege. No one has exercised
the smallest authority over them, save by our permission. They have been
as completely delivered into our hands as children into those of their
parents and instructors. No one has ever had the power to thwart our
wise and benevolent purposes; and now, at the expiration of nearly
one-third of the time which has elapsed since the Christian era, the
country contains eight millions, on their own showing, of persecuted
innocents, whom it is the sole occupation of every English mind to
injure and disparage; on ours (if some of our loudest spokesmen can be
taken as our representatives), of lazy, lawless savages, whose want of
industry and energy keeps them ever on the verge of starvation, whose
want of respect for life and property makes it unsafe for civilized
beings to dwell among them. England unanimously repudiates the first
theory: but is the other much less disgraceful to us? An independent
nation is, in all essentials, what it has made itself by its own
efforts; but a nation conquered and held in subjection ever since it had
a history, is what its conquerors have made it, or have caused it to
become. Yet this reflection does not seem to inspire Englishmen
generally with any feeling of shame. The evils of Ireland sit as lightly
on the English conscience as if England had exhausted every effort in
struggling against them—as if England had done all which the most
enlightened and disinterested benevolence could suggest for governing
the Irish well, and for civilising and improving them. What has ever yet
been done, or seriously attempted, for either purpose, except latterly,
by taking off some of the loads we ourselves had laid on, history will
be at a loss to discover.

Is this want of will on England’s part, or want of capacity? Foreigners,
with an excusable injustice, pronounce that it is want of will. It is
not, however, by Edition: current; Page: [881] England’s voluntary
choice that Ireland is what she is. England would far rather that she
were otherwise. England wishes nothing but good to Ireland, and has
shown, by large gifts of money from time to time1—the most irrefragable
evidence of sincerity in this commercial age—how gladly she would make
sacrifices to promote Irish well-being, provided that it could be done
without deviating one-tenth of an inch from some extremely beaten track;
without introducing a single principle not already familiar even to
triteness in English practice; without alarming the most insignificant
English vested interest that chanced to be called by the same name as
some Irish nuisance. Unfortunately, no good could be done in Ireland
under these conditions. Accordingly, the work is still to be begun; and
an emergency, pressing so instantly for action as to leave scarcely any
time for deliberation, finds the public, to all appearance, unfurnished
with any opinions on the nature of the remedy which the condition of
Ireland requires.

Amidst the miserable paucity of suggestions, good, indifferent, or even
bad, which the present Irish crisis has called forth, it is a fact that
one only has hitherto been urged with any vigour, or re-echoed widely by
the organs through which opinions find their way to the public; and that
one is—what? A poor-law, with extensive out-door relief to the
able-bodied!2 This, then, is what the progress of reason and experience
has brought us to: this is the sum of what our wisdom can devise to make
an indolent people industrious, to gift an improvident people with
prudence and forethought. That which has pauperised nearly the whole
agricultural population of England is the expedient recommended for
raising to comfort and independence the peasantry of Ireland! Most
things which have been done or proposed in our time, as benefits to that
unfortunate country, were merely frivolous: they diverted attention from
the real evils, and were so far injurious; but the mischief stopped
there. They left things, at all events, no worse than they found them.
But this, the only scheme of which we now hear much—which seems to be
the beginning and the ending of what the Times, for example, with all
its energetic protests against the state of social relations in Ireland,
can find to propose for their amendment3—this we verily believe to be
the one thing that the Legislature could do by which the economical
evils of Edition: current; Page: [882] Ireland would be made worse than
they already are. It is the one thing which would set the seal to Irish
misery, the thing which would take away even the possibility of
improvement. The Legislature which could deliberately adopt it must be
nothing less than insane; and the writers who advocate it are flinging
away a great power and a golden opportunity, for the sake of a
mischievous chimera.


307.: THE CASE OF PRIVATE MATTHEWSON
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 6 OCT., 1846, P. 4

John Thomas Matthewson (b. ca. 1823), a private soldier, was brought
before a court-martial on 29 Sept., 1846, for using abusive language to
Sergeant Robert O’Donnell; see the report (from which Mill quotes), in
“Court-Martial at Hounslow,” The Times, 30 Sept., p. 3. His sentence of
six months, including two months’ solitary confinement, was reported in
The Times, 9 Oct., pp. 4-5. This, the third of the unheaded articles on
injustice and cruelty by Harriet Taylor and Mill (see No. 303) is
described in his bibliography as “A leading article on the case of
Private Thomas Matthewson, in the Morning Chronicle of 6th October 1846,
a joint production very little of which was mine”

(MacMinn, p. 60).

we think it very desirable that the Government and the public should
keep their attention fixed on the case of Private Thomas Matthewson, who
was tried by court-martial at Hounslow, on Tuesday last, for abusive
language to a non-commissioned officer. Whether he was found guilty by
the court has not yet transpired, as the publication of the sentence
does not take place until it has been confirmed by the
Commander-in-Chief; but there is far more than enough apparent on the
proceedings to require that the result should be watched.

This man Matthewson, it may be remembered, was one of the witnesses in
the case of death from flogging, which contributed so much to bring
about the partial abolition of that punishment.1 His evidence was of a
nature to be peculiarly Edition: current; Page: [883] disagreeable to
his commanding officer, being one of those which imputed to him, in the
most direct manner, neglect and want of feeling with regard to the
sufferer. Matthewson, also, was the witness to whom menaces were said to
have been indirectly held out as to the probable consequences to himself
of the evidence he gave; and although this was not thought to have been
substantiated, it was not denied that Colonel Whyte publicly addressed
him on parade, saying that he was as near as—(what type of nearness the
colonel employed we do not think it necessary to repeat)—to having
perjured himself. This gentle apostrophe, however merited it may in the
colonel’s opinion have been, neither betokened in the present, nor
augured for the future, any amicable feelings on the part of the
commanding officer towards Private Matthewson. We are far from implying
that because an officer has received what he thinks provocation from a
private, he must necessarily become his unscrupulous enemy. But Private
Matthewson must have had far more than ordinary confidence in the
magnanimity of his commanding officer, if he did not feel certain that,
in some way or other, he would be made to smart severely for his
evidence; that if a charge were not actually got up against him, an
opportunity would be watched of exaggerating some trifling peccadillo
into a grave offence; that, in short, he would be a marked man, and if
not to the colonel himself, to some of those miserable waiters upon
power, who, we may be sure, are not wanting in a regiment any more than
in a court, and who might think that the ruin of one who had made
himself obnoxious would be a satisfaction to those whom they wished to
please, even if it were only the satisfaction derived from the
fulfilment of a prophecy. If this surmise is not already verified by
what has just taken place, there is a coincidence most unfortunate for
all those upon whom any share of the suspicion can possibly fall.

We will suppose that Matthewson, after giving the evidence which
reflected discredit upon Colonel Whyte, was really guilty of a serious
military offence. We should have expected that, considering what had
happened, and the prejudice likely to exist against him, not only in his
own regiment, but among any officers composing a court-martial (for the
great majority of officers are supporters of corporal punishment, and it
is no secret that the sympathies of officers are almost always with the
officer against the soldier)—we should have expected, we say, that
scrupulous care would have been taken to make it impossible for even the
prisoner himself to deny that the most generous justice was done him. We
should have expected that the testimony against him would have been
sifted with the most jealous vigilance; that rather a greater amount of
evidence than is deemed sufficient in ordinary cases would have been
insisted on; and that the most studious and ostentatious attention would
have been paid to giving him every facility, and to showing that every
facility had been given, for the production of any evidence which he
might think available to weaken, though it were only in a slight degree,
the strength of the case against him.

Instead of this, what do we see? By a most unfortunate accident, if it
be an Edition: current; Page: [884] accident, the trial takes place
after Matthewson’s own regiment has left the neighbourhood, and along
with it the witnesses whom he could have called, either to points of the
case itself, or to his general character. This obstacle, probably, was
not insuperable; he might have “applied to the commanding officer”
(Colonel Whyte himself) to have the witnesses detained; and if he had
done so, we will hope that the request would have been complied with.
We, therefore, do not insist further on this point, which may be worse
in appearance than in reality. But there is another feature in the case,
which would be fatal to the prosecution—whether with a military tribunal
we know not—but with any civil tribunal of decent impartiality. The
man’s alleged offence is the use of insulting words, and there is
absolutely no evidence to the words he used, or to his having used
insulting words at all, except that of Sergeant O’Donnell, the very man
alleged to have been insulted. There is no circumstantial evidence, and
no corroborative testimony but that of Corporal Routh, who “was not
sufficiently near to hear what took place,” and could only affirm that
“by his manner the prisoner appeared to be speaking disrespectfully to
the sergeant.” But it was not for disrespectfulness of manner that he
was brought before the court. In the circumstances alleged there was
nothing to explain or render probable the abusive expressions said to
have been used, which are such as were only likely to be employed in the
heat of passion, or as the consequence of a previous altercation. When
policemen are declared to be in the habit of giving false evidence
against innocent persons, is it too much to suspect an affronted
sergeant of some exaggeration? Especially when the prisoner declares him
to have been drunk at the time, and against the assertion of one of the
two parties to a dispute it is not unfair to oppose the denial of the
other.

We have argued the matter on the footing of simple justice, and the
treatment due to every human being. If it were to be looked at on
grounds of chivalrous or gentlemanly feeling, it would be much more
concisely disposed of. Supposing such feelings to have had any voice in
the matter, the commanding officer, one may presume, would rather have
given up his commission than that Private Matthewson, while under his
command, should be in a position in which it would be felt that the one
was inflicting, and the other undergoing vengeance for unacceptable
evidence in a court of justice. There are means enough for ridding a
regiment of a troublesome character, when his presence is no longer
supportable. If Matthewson was such a character, the consequences of
giving him his discharge would have been (in the peculiar circumstances
of this case) less prejudicial to discipline than the moral impression
of his being made a victim—which, truly or not, he will be thought to
be, if found guilty and sentenced on this inadequately supported charge.

The part of prosecutor was worthily filled by a Viscount St. Lawrence,2
who Edition: current; Page: [885] came armed with all the means which
the books of the regiment and his own testimony could supply for
crushing the already crushed man.


308.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [2]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 7 OCT., 1846, P. 4

For the context of this argument against The Times’ advocacy of an
expanded Irish Poor Law, which would allow outdoor relief in exchange
for labour on public works, see No. 306. The unheaded leader is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “A second leading article on Irish
affairs in the Morning Chronicle of 7th October 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 60).

the alpha and omega of the schemes for the relief of Ireland—the
quintessence of all the propositions we hear, is, give, give, give. The
points on which there is diversity are only, who is to give, and whom it
is to be given to. While some people are for giving themselves, some are
only for making others give, and some would have no objection to make
the crisis an opportunity for receiving. The cry of some persons is, let
England give; and give to the peasantry, to those who are really in
want. There is charity in this proposal, if not wisdom, when it comes
from this side of the Irish Channel; when from the other side, it is
something else; it is the conduct of him who begs for charity, which, if
rarely meritorious or dignified, is excusable when there is nothing else
to be done. But the Irish landlords next present themselves, and
exclaim, give to us. Lend to us below the market rate of interest, that
we may pay off our mortgages; we shall then have a large income for our
own use, with part of which we will employ the poor. Or, lend us a round
sum on the mortgage of our estates, which are already so deeply
mortgaged that we cannot raise an additional farthing from any other
source; and instead of paying off our mortgages we will do better—we
will employ the loan in cultivating our lands and improving our estates
for ourselves. This charming scheme for giving to the poor by means of
giving to the landlords, does not seem to have made many converts among
those to whom the part assigned in it is that of givers. It has rather
provoked them to give the thing a contrary turn, and to demand whether,
instead of receiving, the Irish landlords are not the very persons who
should be required to give. And justly too. If the working bees are
short of winter provision, they have a claim on their own drones before
they can have any on the bees of another hive. The whole Irish
population, therefore, are to be quartered on the landlords, and as a
machinery for the purpose, the Times is ready with its Poor-law, and its
lavish system of out-door relief.1

But the objection common to all these schemes is, that they consist of
giving, and nothing more. That objection is fatal. Did ever any one
hear, was ever any Edition: current; Page: [886] one so completely out
of his senses as to imagine, that the whole social and economical state
of a country could be made to rest upon giving? Giving, when the whole
labouring population are the parties concerned, is a thing to be done
once, and then largely and generously, to the full measure of the need.
But it is not a thing to be done at all, save when the object to be
compassed, or at least greatly promoted, is that of so altering the
condition of the receivers, that they shall not need to look to giving
as a permanent resource. If this could be accomplished for Ireland—and
that it could we are fully prepared to show—we will not venture to say
what sum of money we would not willingly give, and call on others to
give, for so noble a purpose. Or if the habitual condition of the Irish
people were satisfactory, and the present distress a sharp but passing
calamity, as little connected with the general course of events as the
cholera—a torrent which they only required to be helped through, to be
landed again in prosperity on the other side—then too we could join our
voices with those who say, give freely, and ask no questions about the
future. But as things are, we protest with all our force against giving
one additional farthing on plans which hold out no better promise than
that, after a larger or smaller sum of money is spent and gone, the
Irish will be exactly as they were before. Give as much as you will, but
let it be for the permanent improvement of the condition of the people.
We will not hear of any giving merely to feed the disease, not to cure
it.

But the Times’ plan of a Poor-law would do much more than feed the
disease—it would render it surely and rapidly mortal. There is already a
Poor-law, by which all who choose to accept its conditions are
guaranteed against actual famine. The demands of the Times are, to break
down all the salutary barriers which the law erects to prevent the
people from making what ought to be an extreme resource an habitual one:
to erect a system by which in fact, and indeed in intention, the
peasantry of Ireland would depend on a compulsory assessment for their
daily bread. Assume that the thing is possible—assume that it would not,
as in a short time it certainly would, absorb the whole rental of the
country, and reduce all other classes to the condition of labourers,
while it reduced the labourers to the condition of paupers; suppose that
it would not do this, but something short of this, what would be its
effect on the minds and habits of the labourers themselves? The
senseless crusade against the English Poor-law, to which the Times has
unhappily committed itself2—which is perpetually crossing and marring
the better inspirations of its writers, and in which its self-importance
is now too much involved to allow a hope of its receding from its false
position—this pet fanaticism of its own ought not, however, to be so
mere a fanaticism as to make it incapable of seeing conclusions, the
premises of which are daily set forth, with studied exaggeration, in its
own columns. It ought not to be so much the slave of its fixed-idea as
to be Edition: current; Page: [887] unable to perceive, that even if the
strict principles of the English Poor-law were not necessary for
England, they would still be the only Poor-law principles adapted to
Ireland. Are the Irish, on the showing of the Times and its
Commissioner,3 a people who can be trusted with an unlimited license to
draw upon the national alms? It has been the custom of the Times and its
fellow crusaders (auxiliaries with whom it must itself be often rather
ashamed to keep company) to assert that the English peasantry were
calumniated by the authors of the Poor-law; that it is not true that the
industry and self-reliance of the English labourer broke down under the
pauperising system, which destroyed all the natural motives to those
virtues; that in spite of the tendency which prejudice itself cannot
pretend not to see in a system which exempts the labourer from taking
any care of himself, by promising to take care for him, the virtue of
independence is still so deeply rooted in the character of the English
peasant, that he has borne, and can bear, a moral regimen to all
appearance the most destructive of any such feeling or quality. A bitter
mockery is this false praise of the spiritless, depressed being which
the Times itself delights in representing the English peasant to be. But
the Irish peasant: what of him? Is he a similar paragon of industry,
providence, self-reliance, and the other virtues of that mythological
creation, “a stout peasantry?”4 Listen to Mr. Foster—listen to the
“Times Commissioner,” and he will tell you that the Irish peasant, while
he has his sufficient meal of bad, watery potatoes, will not stir two
steps from the door of his turf hut to gain either comfort or luxury at
the cost of half an hour’s exertion; that when a boat is found for him
by his own parish priest, and a thousand herrings may be caught in one
day, neither the prize can tempt nor the priest persuade him to make use
of the opportunity; or he perhaps goes once, and brings home a week’s
subsistence; but, declaring it too much trouble ever to go again,
loiters at home and asks a passing traveller for money.5 Such are said
to be the people to whom the Times wishes the Legislature to declare,
that they need not take any trouble to feed themselves, for it will make
the landlords feed them. Listen next to the Times itself.6 It has
several times made the remark, that even the small measure of alms and
employment held out to the Irish by the parliamentary grants of last
year, has had such an unfortunate effect on them, that, bad as their
condition was, those who were accustomed to come to England Edition:
current; Page: [888] for harvest work, and whom that fact itself proved
to be the most hardworking and the most enterprising of the peasantry,
have not come this summer at all, or have come in greatly diminished
numbers, preferring the mere immunity from starvation, held out by the
Government, to the large gains (for persons in their circumstances)
which it is known they were accustomed to carry back to Ireland on their
return. Imagine this people with a fund to draw upon, in their opinion
unlimited, and, so far as law can make it, really so—a people who, if
what the Times says of them is merited, not only will do nothing for
themselves which they can possibly get done for them by others, but will
go without everything, except mere food, if they must depend on their
own exertions for procuring it.

We know it will be answered that relief is not to be given in alms, but
in exchange for work, and that it is not intended to pay the idleness of
the people, but their industry. As if experience had not done justice to
all such projects. As if England had forgotten the once familiar scenes
of pauper labour on the roads and in the gravel-pits. As if the very
ideas of industry and compulsory payment did not (in the language of a
French writer) shriek at finding themselves together.7 An ordinary
labourer knows that unless he work neither shall he eat; that he must
give for his day’s wages the ordinary day’s work of the country, or
otherwise he will not be employed. A parish-paid labourer knows that his
wages are to be paid to him at any rate, and that his employers may get
from him afterwards such day’s work as they can. A people who we are
told will not do the easiest day’s work for their own undivided benefit,
are yet expected to do for the parish or the state any work worth paying
for. Unless the Irish have been, not merely a little wronged, but foully
calumniated by Mr. Foster—unless they are the exact contrary of what he
paints them—the work done for the parish would be nominal work, and of
other work nothing would be done at all. While men are what they are,
they can be induced to habitual labour by only two motives—reward and
punishment. The reward of the Irish, and even of the English peasant, is
a sufficiently wretched one—a bare subsistence. But if even that is
annihilated as a reward by being severed from the industry which is to
earn it, there is no other incentive remaining but punishment; the
labour must be compulsory, the labourer must be a slave. Those whom you
are forced to feed must be forced to work; and there is not, there never
has been, any permanent means by which human beings can be forced to
labour all their lives for other people, but the lash. Such is the
alternative to which the Times, and the counsels of the Times, would
reduce the people whom it patronises.

Because the Irish are indolent, unenterprising, careless of the future,
doing nothing for themselves, and demanding everything from other
people; because, being freemen, they want the characteristic virtues of
freemen, it is proposed to create a fit soil for the growth of those
virtues by placing them in the position of slaves!

309.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [3]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 10 OCT., 1846, P. 4

For the context, see No. 306. With the definition of cottier tenancy
Mill gives here, compare his account in Principles of Political Economy,
Bk. II, Chap. ix (CW, Vol. II, p. 312). This unheaded leader is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “A third leading article on Irish
affairs in the Morning Chronicle of 10th October 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 60).

the grand economical evil of ireland is the cottier-tenant system. We
were on the point of calling it the grand moral evil also. Neither the
economical nor the moral evils admit of any considerable alleviation
while that baneful system continues.

This truth is the foundation of the philosophy of Irish wretchedness and
Irish improvement. It is the one thing to be known, remembered, and
perpetually thought of by all who concern themselves about that country.
It is the conclusion which almost every one who sincerely and seriously
applies his mind to the matter ends by aiming at. There is hardly any
road whereby a conscientious thinker can approach the subject of Irish
distress which does not lead directly to it.

But it is not always clearly seen in what the radical mischief of this
tenure, as it exists in Ireland, consists. It is often confounded with
the evil of small holdings. Holdings certainly may, under any system, be
too small. But there may be small holdings without a cottier system; and
there may be a cottier system without small holdings.

A cottier system may be defined, that in which the produce of the land
is divided between two sharers—a landlord on one side, and labourers on
the other; the competition of the labourers being the regulating
principle of the division. To see this system in the fulness of its
pernicious fruits, two other circumstances must be supposed, both of
which pre-eminently exist in Ireland:—a country over-peopled, at least
in proportion to the efficiency of its industry, and no considerable
outlet for labour, otherwise than in agriculture.

In all countries in which the labouring population have no property,
their condition depends upon the intensity of the competition for
employment. In England, and most civilized countries, the pressure of
this competition is upon capital; in Ireland, under the cottier system,
it is upon land. In England, overpopulation produces its effect by
lowering wages; in Ireland, by raising rent.

Now, there is a truth so universally borne out by experience, as almost
to partake of the character of a law of nature; and it is this. Whenever
a population, excessive in proportion to the productive power of its
industry, depends for subsistence wholly upon the occupancy of land,
their competition drives them to offer for the land a rent merely
nominal, a rent greater than the utmost which, even on the most
favourable supposition, they can possibly pay. A farmer who Edition:
current; Page: [890] has capital, who brings something to the farm, and
risks something upon it, will not bind himself to a higher rent than he
thinks he can pay without, at all events, encroaching on his capital. A
labourer who bids for land, not for the sake of profit, but for
subsistence, and with whom not to have land is to be without the means
of living, will offer anything rather than be outbid by his neighbour.
In such a case, if there is any limit to the nominal amount of rent, it
is to be found, not in the calculations of the tenant, but in the
moderation of the landlord, his justice, humanity, or enlightened
perception of self-interest.

This is well understood in the East. In India, as in Ireland, there is a
superabundant population depending wholly on land. In India, as in
Ireland, the people will promise to pay anything for the land rather
than not obtain it. The owner of the land therefore, who in India is
generally the Government, has long since discovered that it will not do
to leave the matter to competition; that itself, as landlord, must not
ask the tenant what he will pay, but must determine for him what he can
pay, and resolutely abstain from asking more; that if it has
inadvertently asked too much, it must not hold the tenant to his
contract, but at once cancel it, and grant another; that this is its
interest, even in the narrowest and most selfish acceptation; that in
the long run (and not a very long run either) it gets more rent by this
mode of proceeding than by any other. Not the English Government in
India only, but all tolerably-administered Native governments, have been
taught this wisdom by experience.

The Irish landlords have not generally had this wisdom. Improvident and
reckless themselves, needy and indebted, and therefore, by a sort of
necessity, rapacious, they have never known how to part with even the
shadow of a present gain for the sake of a more certain gain in the
future. Many of them, too, preferred increase of power even to increase
of income; and were not unwilling that their tenant should enter into
engagements which they knew he could not fulfil. They therefore
permitted and encouraged rent to grow up, under the impulse of
competition, to the point of impossibility. They were thus enabled in
all seasons, good or bad, to take everything which the tenant had,
except a bare subsistence—and what those words mean in Ireland, we know;
and as even then there was always a balance due, the tenant being in the
landlord’s debt was in the landlord’s power, and could at all times, as
far as law was concerned, be ejected at pleasure. The various
Parliamentary inquiries into the state of Ireland have elicited the fact
that tenants have not only covenanted to pay, but actually paid to the
landlord more than the whole produce of the land they rented.1 Their
earnings by English harvest work went chiefly to the landlord; and in
the small portion of Ireland in which the peasants follow a double trade
as agriculturists and weavers, they have been known to pay to the
landlord part of their earnings as weavers, in Edition: current; Page:
[891] addition to the whole produce of their plot of land;—so intense
was the association in their minds between being without land and
destitution, so uncontrollable the wish to retain at all costs a hold on
some corner of earth, upon which, if other resources failed, they could
fall back, and claim that ration of potatoes which any landlord must
leave them, since, to pay any rent at all, it is necessary that the
tenant should be alive.

We believe that the evil of nominal rents is now generally felt among
the Irish landlords themselves, and that those who do not let their
lands by competition, or at rack rents, are a constantly increasing
proportion. But so long as anything in rent is arbitrary, under a
cottier system, the tenant is never secure against the caprice or the
necessities of his landlord. The curse of this system is, that it
destroys, more utterly than any other system of nominally free labour,
all motive either to industry or to prudence. To what end should the
tenant, who is hopelessly in arrear to his landlord, exert himself to
raise a larger produce? There would only be the more for the landlord to
take from him; and one case in ten of its being actually taken is more
than enough, since it is well known how small a doubt in a person’s mind
of his being suffered to enjoy what he earns suffices, when conspiring
with the natural indolence of man, to prevent him from earning it. Of
what consequence to him is it whether he has only two children or ten?
The ten are sure of having their meal of potatoes while there are any on
the farm, and if there were but two they would have no more. A people
have been for half a thousand years under such a régime as this, and men
wonder at them for their indolence, and their want of enterprise, and
their improvident marriages. They must be something more than human if
they were not, in these particulars, all that they are charged with
being.2 But to tell us in all gravity, that because they are all this,
therefore they are so by nature and because of a difference of race, is
a thing which might rouse the indignation even of persons not very
quickly moved to such a sentiment, if that were a proper object of
indignation which is perhaps only an aberration of the intellect.

A cottier-tenant system is essentially an anarchical system. Habitual
disaffection to the law is almost inherent in it. The Russian people are
not more completely separated into serfs and the masters of serfs, than
the Irish people into the cultivators and the owners of land—two classes
standing out with interests distinctly and absolutely contrary, and in a
position which to the minds of the more numerous class cannot seem to be
other than that of robbers and the robbed. The Many occupy and till the
land, and a few, because they have the power, take from them the greater
part of the produce. In England the labourer comes into direct collision
of interest only with the farmer, and he gives something for what he
receives—he gives his capital: even the landlord in England gives for
the rent some equivalent to the farmer—he gives the land, Edition:
current; Page: [892] enriched by former expenditure of capital—the
landlord’s own, or that of previous farmers. But what does the Irish
landlord give? There are many exceptions, we know, as there are many and
honourable exceptions to every thing which has ever been said truly to
the discredit of the class. But as a general fact, the Irish landlord
gives no equivalent for his rent; he takes and appropriates it, not
because he has done anything for the land, but because his ancestor
seized it, or had it given to him by somebody who did. The right of the
Irish landlord to his rent is only that of prescription; a valid title,
but one which is extremely difficult to commend to those who do not
profit by it. That a tenantry like the Irish should connect any
sacredness with the rights of landlords is simply an impossibility; and
it is only the engrossing nature, for centuries past, of the quarrels
about religion which has postponed the breaking out of the permanent and
irreconcileable quarrel which such a people must always have with the
right to land.

The quarrel, however, has been always going on, and has long been a
principal feature in the state of Ireland; but there has hitherto been a
limit to the demands of the weaker side. They have not said that they
would have the land itself, but they have said that they would and
should have leave to grow potatoes on it; and they have made their words
good by assassinating those who turned them out, or those who accepted
after them the place from which they were turned. Such is the cottier
system. Idleness and indigence are its elder children; Rockism its
younger.3 There is another and a younger, still unborn, and that other
is, Confiscation.


310.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [4]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 13 OCT., 1846, P. 4

Irish affairs, in the Morning Chronicle of 13th October 1846”

as no improvement in ireland, worthy of the name, is compatible with the
cottier system—as all schemes of Irish regeneration, which are not the
merest mockery of Irish evils, must propose some means of superseding
and extirpating that form of tenancy—so neither have we been without
suggestions, more or less systematic and matured, which have had this
extirpation for their direct object. Two of these have excited much
attention, and may be said to have deserved it, since, whatever other
objections they are liable to, they would be, or might be, Edition:
current; Page: [893] efficacious for their particular design. One of
them has been more particularly an English scheme, the other an Irish.
The one proposes to alter the agricultural economy of Ireland by means
of the introduction of English capital; the other by establishing what
has been called fixity of tenure. To begin with the first.

The cottier system, say some, has its origin in want of capital.1 The
labourer must work out his subsistence for himself from the land,
because there is no farmer with capital to pay him wages. For the same
reason the land goes unimproved, the culture is slovenly, and the tools
are of the rudest description. Ireland has no capital; and the disturbed
state of Ireland prevents English capital from flowing in. England has
superfluous wealth, which pours itself forth to every other part of the
known and habitable earth. Ireland alone receives no share of this
abounding overflow. Make Ireland tranquil, make life and property
secure, and the spirit of enterprise, for which the world is not
sufficiently wide, will no longer avoid one-third part, and that third
the most fertile part, of the United Kingdom. But with capital comes
employment for labour; with English farming, the social system of the
English rural districts would come in; the cottier system would give way
before another more enlightened, and more conducive to the interests of
all; and in time Ireland, like prosperous England, would have her
landlords, her farmers, and her labourers maintained by wages, instead
of having only landlords, and labourers maintaining themselves by potato
cultivation on little plots of earth.

There is nothing palpably absurd or impossible in this train of supposed
consequences, and this plan was for many years the favourite dream of
amateur English philanthropists who interested themselves for Ireland.
It had the happy recommendation of holding up England and things English
as the standard of excellence for all the world. In institutions and
social arrangements comparatively little had then occurred to disturb on
this point our habitual national self-complacency. The “English
cottager” was in those days looked upon as that type of rustic felicity
which he is even now held to be by those lady-travellers, and
gentlemen-travellers also, who favour the world with printed narratives
of their first continental tour. At that time there were not many people
to whom the reflection occurred, that a population might be fed on wages
and still be wretchedly ill off; nor was it doubted but that the
self-indulgent, sans-souci Irish potato-digger would rush eagerly to
change places with the anxious, care-worn, and not much better fed
Dorsetshire labourer, the very instant that the blessed opportunity was
afforded to him. Time and better knowledge have considerably modified
the general opinion of England on this among many points.

Edition: current; Page: [894]
But there is another reason which has contributed still more to bring
into discredit the theory which looked for the cure of Irish economical
evils from what was called the improvement of Irish agriculture.
Improvement in the English sense, improvement by the more powerful
instruments and processes of capitalist-farmers, though it raises a far
greater net produce than the Irish system, yet from its very nature
employs fewer hands. For a time, therefore, its sole tendency is to
aggravate the evil which it is expected to cure. Its ultimate effects
need not here be entered upon. We may grant that its increased
efficiency and economy, the far greater ratio which its produce bears to
the smaller quantity of labour employed, the large profits it yields,
and the means and motives which it consequently holds out to
accumulation, may in time enable the country to raise a larger gross
produce, and to maintain, therefore, a larger population than could ever
exist on the system of small holdings and peasant-farmers. This is one
of the long disputed questions which political economists and practical
agriculturists have not yet settled among themselves. Their opinions on
the subject diverge, widely and with bigotry. But about the immediate
effects there is not and cannot be any difference. The introduction of
English farming is another word for the clearing system. It must begin
by ejecting the peasantry of a tract of country from the land they
occupy, and handing it over en bloc to a capitalist-farmer. The number
of those whom he would require to retain as labourers would be far short
of the number he displaced. What becomes of the remainder? The increased
net produce of the land, when “improved,” may create a demand for more
labour; but what is to be done in the meantime? And when the demand
came, it would be in great part for manufacturing, not agricultural
labour, to supply, not the necessities, but the comforts and luxuries of
the affluent farmers. But Ireland has little besides agricultural
labour, and the displaced cottiers are capable of no other. Compared
with what we should then see, all we have yet seen of the clearing
system and its horrors is a bagatelle. No one has seen the systematic
unpeopling of estates on the scale necessary for introducing a system of
farming by hired labour. What we have seen, and on a small number of
estates only, has been intended not to abolish cottier tenancies, but
merely to correct in some degree that extreme subdivision under which,
after feeding the cottier and his family, there was hardly anything
remaining for rent.

We shall here state at once our opinion, in plain terms, respecting this
clearing system, by which a population, which has for generations lived
and multiplied on the land, is, on the plea of legal rights, suddenly
turned adrift without a provision, to find a living—where there is no
living to be found. It is a thing which no pretence of private right or
public utility ought to induce society to tolerate for a moment. No
legitimate construction of any right of ownership in land, which it is
for the interest of society to permit, will warrant it. We hold at the
same time, that to prevent the growth of a redundant population on an
estate is not only not blameable, but is one of the chief duties of a
landowner having the Edition: current; Page: [895] power over his
tenants which the Irish system gives. As it is his duty, so it is, on
any extended computation, his pecuniary interest. He is to be commended
for preventing overpopulation, but to be detested for tolerating first,
and then exterminating it. Society may suffer the thing to be done by
one landlord, or by two or three, without interfering otherwise than by
a moral stigma; because the sufferers, having a larger surface to spread
over, may obtain relief by employment, or charity: and for another
reason—there are many powers useful to society in the main, but
susceptible of such perversion as would render them unendurable evils.
One of these is the free disposal of land by the landowner. These powers
society permits to exist, but reserves to itself a liberty of
interference in extreme cases. Any extension of the system of clearing
such that the destitution produced would rise to the magnitude of a
social evil, constitutes such an extreme case; and if society failed in
the imperative duty of interference, it is a satisfaction to reflect,
lawless and anti-social as the alternative is, that there is a force of
resistance in human beings, in the last resort, which does not always
suffer the extreme of injustice to be consummated with safety to the
perpetrators. “Captain Rock” and his family have solved the question of
Irish clearances. They have made it, and will continue to make it,
impracticable to abolish the cottier system by the simple plan of
abolishing the lives of the cottiers themselves.


311.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [5]

For the context of this discussion on fixity of tenure, see Nos. 309-10.
For the context of the Irish series, see No. 306. This unheaded leader
is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A fifth leading article on Irish

at that one brief period in its long existence in which the Repeal
Association condescended to give to the real evils of Ireland a place,
though but a secondary one, in its list of complaints and grievances1—at
that rare and long-waited-for moment in its history when its discussions
and its agitation held out for the first time some promise of being
useful, and therefore in the eyes of a certain sort of people some
threat of being dangerous, and which Sir Robert Peel accordingly
selected for his well-judged attempt to put down the Association by the
hands of Edition: current; Page: [896] law,2 thereby stopping the good,
though not the evil, which it had begun to set in motion—the English
people, and especially the landed and propertied classes, were startled
from their propriety by the new and ominous sound of Fixity of Tenure.

These words express a mode of abolishing cottier tenancy, the reverse,
in all respects, of the clearing system; the reverse in practice, and
still more decidedly contrary in theory. For while the one recognises no
rights in anybody connected with the land save him whom the law
denominates its owner, and treats those whose hands till it as if they
were created for it, and it for the landlord; the other proceeds upon a
view of the relative moral rights of these classes—strange, we must
allow, and paradoxical to minds bred in the traditions of English social
economy. It actually maintains, that when a hundred families and their
ancestors for many generations have cultivated certain lands, and
received therefrom the smallest share of the produce on which they could
live, and one family and its ancestors have during the same period done
nothing to the land, except consume in idleness all the rest of what has
been produced by the hundred—if things at any time come to such a pass
between the hundred families and the one family as that either one or
the other must quit, this theory, which calls itself Fixity of Tenure,
dares actually assert that it is the one and not the hundred who ought
to depart; that let the law say what it will, when we come to the root
of the matter, the hundred have the best claim to be there in foro
conscientiae, and on the substantial principles of right and wrong; and
that it is the duty of the Legislature to make its laws accord with
those supreme principles.

The scheme, in short, is to protect the tenantry against being ever
turned out for the mere pecuniary interest of the landlord, and against
ever having their rent raised beyond what is paid at present, or what
would be fixed by an impartial arbitrator as the present value of the
land. The owner is considered entitled to his rent, but to his rent
alone; not to any power over the tenant—power extending to taking away
his livelihood; and not even to any increase of rent. The present rent
would be fixed for ever as a quit-rent. Subject to that fixed annual
payment, the property in the land would in truth be transferred to the
tenant; the present landlords no longer owning the land itself, but a
rent-charge payable from its produce.

The objections to this scheme are so obvious, that justice has never
been done, on this side of the Irish Channel, to its merits. It is a
real and a thorough remedy. It goes to the very root of Irish evils. In
place of the worst economical system that afflicts any country not
cursed with actual slavery, it would substitute the very best of which a
country like Ireland is susceptible. It would give to Ireland the
Edition: current; Page: [897] inestimable blessing of a peasant
proprietary. Give them fixity of tenure, and they would thenceforth work
and save for themselves alone. Their industry would be their own profit;
their idleness would be their own loss. If they multiplied imprudently,
it would be at their own expense, no longer at the expense of the
landlords. Here is the secret for converting an indolent and reckless
into a laborious, provident, and careful people. It is a secret which
never fails. All over Europe, the untiring labourer, the peasant whose
industry and vigilance never sleep, is he who owns the land he tills.
Labours are executed by peasant proprietors such as are seen no where
else, as it would be irrational to expect anywhere else. It would never
answer to a farmer or a landlord to pay wages to any one for doing what
a peasant proprietor will do on his own ground, and call it not labour
but pleasure. All over Europe too, wherever the increase of population
is slow, not from legal restraints but from individual prudence, as in
France, Switzerland, Norway, it is in countries of peasant proprietors.

The mischiefs which are to be set against these advantages are not on
the side of the people, but of the landlords. The plan of fixity of
tenure would be unjust to them, unless compensation were made to them
for the present value of the future increase of rent which they might
expect from the ordinary progress of society. The power which they would
be deprived of is not a proper subject of compensation. Power in one
human being over others must be presumed to exist for other purposes
than the pleasure or benefit of the person possessing it, and any
complaint of personal injury in being deprived of it should be hooted
out of court with ignominy. Still, however, the change would be a
violent disturbance of legal rights, amounting almost to a social
revolution, though not greater than that which has been effected in
Prussia, amidst the applauses of Europe, by the edicts of an absolute
Sovereign.3 To enlightened foreigners, to Von Raumer or Gustave de
Beaumont, the thing appears so natural and obvious, that they are hardly
able to account for its not having yet been done.4 But to those who
understand the fixed habits of thought, and artificial feelings stronger
than nature itself, which must be broken through before an English
legislature could sanction so drastic a process; and who appreciate the
danger of tampering, in times of political and moral change, with the
salutary prepossessions by which property is protected against
spoliation; a measure like this must be looked upon as an extreme
remedy, justifiable only as remedies even more revolutionary would be
Edition: current; Page: [898] justifiable if there existed no other
means of overcoming evils like those of Ireland.

Our conviction, however, is, that those evils are not to be remedied by
anything less than the creation of a numerous peasant proprietary.
Property in the soil has a sort of magic power of engendering industry,
perseverance, forethought in an agricultural people. Any other charm for
producing those qualities we know not of, and should be thankful to any
one who could point one out. All other schemes for the improvement of
Ireland are schemes for getting rid of the people. The very best is a
gigantic plan of emigration, impracticably costly, yet, if executed,
having no guarantee in the altered relations of society that those left
behind would not soon be as miserable as ever. No such guarantee is
possible but by making an effectual change in the motives of conduct
operating upon the people themselves. There is no known means of working
that change but by creating peasant proprietors. Happily, however, it is
not necessary for the end in view that the whole peasantry should be
owners of land. It is enough if there be a large class, objects of
emulation to all the rest, and among whom no one who exerts himself need
despair of being numbered. The one measure of practicable improvement
for Ireland is to form such a class, and the obvious resource for this
purpose is the waste lands.


312.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [6]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 15 OCT., 1846, P. 4

For the context, see No. 306. This unheaded leader, which opens with a
quotation from Over-Population, and Its Remedy (London: Longman, et al.,
1846) by Mill’s friend and India Office colleague, William Thomas
Thornton (1813-80), is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A sixth
leading article on Irish affairs in the Morning Chronicle of 15th
October 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 61).

two miles from the little town of Kilcullen, in Kildare, is a tract of
excessively green land, dotted over with brilliant white cottages, each
with its couple of trim acres of garden, where you see thick potato
ridges covered with blossom, great blue plots of comfortable cabbages,
and such pleasant plants of the poor man’s garden. Two or three years
since, the land was a marshy common, which had never since the days of
the Deluge fed any being bigger than a snipe, and into which the poor
people descended, draining and cultivating, and rescuing the marsh from
the water, and raising their cabins, and setting up their little
enclosures of two or three acres upon the land which they had thus
created. There are now two hundred flourishing little homesteads upon
this rescued land, and as many families in comfort and plenty. Now, if
two or three acres of reclaimed marsh can furnish plentiful subsistence
to one family, 600,000 acres would do as much for 200,000 families; that
is to say, for one-fourth part of the Irish peasantry, which is as large
a proportion as can well be supposed unable to procure a competent
livelihood. According Edition: current; Page: [899] to the most recent
accounts, there are considerably more than six millions of acres of land
lying waste in Ireland, of which about three-fifths are acknowledged to
be improvable.1

This passage is from the work of Mr. William Thornton, Over-population
and its Remedy; a book honourably distinguished from most others of
recent date, by the union of philanthropic feelings with sound knowledge
and good sense. We recommend the whole work, and particularly its
opinions and recommendations on Irish affairs, to the consideration of
those who have any power over the present critical turning point in the
destinies of that ill-treated country.

Mr. Foster’s indolent Celt,2 then, is not incapable of enterprise and
persevering industry, when the object which calls forth those qualities
lies in the direction of his previous habits. He is already an improver
and reclaimer of waste lands; nay, he is almost alone in that character.
Mr. Nicholls states, that most of the recently recovered bog which he
saw in his journey through the western counties was reclaimed, not by
the landlords, but by small occupiers, who drained and enclosed an acre
or two at a time.3 This they did without even the motive of property;
knowing that they could not thereby acquire a title to the land; knowing
that the best which they could expect would be to hold the ground rent
free, until the landlord’s or his agent’s sense of justice had exhausted
itself with the degree of forbearance shown them. Squatters are, we have
reason to think, by no means unfrequent on Irish estates. These people
reclaim and cultivate the waste, well knowing that they shall have rent
to pay, and that ultimately they shall only be permitted to hold the
land which they have rendered productive, on the same footing as other
cottiers. But they hope for a few years’ respite. They hope to be
allowed to make the land worth taking before the landlord steps in and
takes it. They hope that he will for a few years connive at their doing
his work, at their supporting themselves by the land while they render
it capable of afterwards affording rent to him.

The fact, then, being established, that the waste can be reclaimed by
the peasantry themselves, even from a less motive than a property in it,
and without any assistance from the State, one would think the most
obvious idea which could present itself to any one who wished to use the
waste lands as an instrument for improving the condition of the
peasantry, would be to make that which already takes place on a small
scale take place on a large, by giving to the Edition: current; Page:
[900] peasantry the inducement of property in the soil reclaimed by
them, and by affording to them, from the State, such assistance as may
be needful, and as the State is willing to give. The assistance required
would cost less to the State than the most moderate sum ever voted by
Parliament for Irish distress. That the bogs and mountains of Ireland
may sometimes be drained and enclosed without capital, is proved by the
fact that the thing is already done. It often requires nothing but
labour—a commodity of which Irish cottiers have always more than enough
on their hands. It would be necessary to buy up the rights of those who
are now the nominal owners of these lands; for there can be no more than
nominal ownership of that which has never been used since the country
was inhabited, and cannot be used now unless the State supplies the
means. The value of an Irish bog is only the value of the right to cut
turf on it. Having become the proprietor of the whole or a sufficient
portion of the waste, the State could divide it into portions of the
most convenient size, and grant these in absolute property to such of
the peasantry as could produce the best certificates of steadiness and
industry, or to such as would undertake to bring their lots into
cultivation with the smallest amount of pecuniary assistance. If it were
necessary to advance to each family a year’s food, and a trifle for
tools, where would be the difficulty? The interest of this, laid on in
the form of a perpetual quit-rent, would save the State from loss, and
would be but a small abatement from the value of the boon; or instead of
a perpetual, the State might receive its compensation in the form of a
terminable annuity, so as ultimately to enfranchise the land from all
payment. In cases in which it would be desirable to operate on a greater
scale, by draining at once the whole of a large tract of country, the
State can as easily do this for the peasantry as Lord Besborough can now
undertake to do it for the landlords.4 The work, during its execution,
would provide food and employment for the famishing people in the one
way as effectually as in the other, and the State could be indemnified
by an additional quit-rent, payable from the new peasant proprietors.

By this plan one-fourth or one-third of the Irish peasantry would, in
two or three years, be not only in a state of present ease, but under
the influence of the strongest attainable motives to industry, prudence,
and economy, and with their interests all ranged on the side of
tranquillity and the law, because the law would have ceased to be their
oppressor, and become their benefactor. Nor would the benefit stop here.
The remaining peasantry, and the landlords themselves, would be only a
degree less benefitted than the new proprietary. That clearance of
estates which is now synonymous with turning out the population to
starve, and which, precisely because it ought not, cannot be effected
save on the most inconsiderable scale while things remain as at present,
would then accomplish Edition: current; Page: [901] itself
spontaneously, and with unmixed benefit, by the mere withdrawing of a
large section of the people from the competition for land. The residuary
population would not be too numerous to be supported, in comparative
comfort, yet leaving a large rent for the landlord; and English capital
and English farming might then be introduced with advantage to all,
because the cottier population would no longer exceed the numbers who
could, with benefit to the farmer, be retained on the land as labourers.
Then, and then only, would English capital find its way to Ireland, for
then, and only then, would its owner have nothing to fear from the “wild
justice”5 of an ejected tenantry. That tenantry would exist no more as
tenantry, but they would exist as farm labourers; not such as the
Wiltshire or Dorsetshire labourer, without heart because without hope,
with nothing which he can rise to, nothing to reward or encourage
exertion and self-denial, but a prize of two sovereigns from an
agricultural society, and the poor-house for his sole ultimatum and
harbour of refuge. Not such would the Irish peasant be, but cheered and
stimulated by the hope which animates the Continental labourer, the hope
of being in time numbered, through industry and frugality, among the
class of peasant proprietors; a lot sufficiently above his own to be
desirable, and not sufficiently so to be unattainable.


313.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [7]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 17 OCT., 1846, P. 4

Mill here refers to a temporary relief measure of the Lord Lieutenant,
John William Ponsonby, which ran directly counter to his own ideas. At
Ponsonby’s direction, a proclamation had been prepared by Henry
Labouchere (1798-1869), later 1st Baron Taunton, liberal M.P., who
became Secretary of State of Ireland in the summer of 1846. The
proclamation of 5 Oct., generally known as “Labouchere’s Letter,”
authorized the use of the loans, already set aside for public works
under 9 & 10 Victoria, cc. 107-9 (28 Aug., 1846), for the drainage and
improvement of private estates, the money to be repaid by barony
assessment (see The Times, 8 Oct., p. 5, and 9 Oct., p. 4). Though the
goal was conversion from “unproductive” public works such as unneeded
roads to “reproductive” or useful projects, the result in Mill’s opinion
was the unjustifiable use of state aid to enrich the landlords. For the
other articles in the series and the full context, see No. 306. This
unheaded leader is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A seventh
leading article on Irish affairs, in the Morning Chronicle of 17th
October (the second leader)” (MacMinn, p. 61). (Mill probably specifies
the second leader because the first also pertains to Ireland.)

that the waste lands of ireland are her best resource for the present
temporary emergency—that the large and liberal relief which in a time of
famine Edition: current; Page: [902] must be given to the starving
peasantry had better be given in payment for labour than for idleness,
and for productive labour than for unproductive, and that the reclaiming
of the waste is the chief, not to say almost the only, field which
Ireland affords for employment so productive as to be remunerative—all
this is agreed to by everybody, and is so obvious as to be assented to
as soon as stated. Six million acres of land, of which let us even
suppose that only four millions are improveable—here is a mine of wealth
which, by a remarkable anomaly, still remains to be worked. The rich, we
have been told, could not do it, because they had not the money, or the
enterprise, or for some equally good reason; the poor, because they had
not the legal right. Whether the State ought to find money to do it,
might, with many people, be questionable at other times. But since the
State is, at any rate, to find the money, it is clear to all minds that
what we have already stated is what ought to be done with it. Since,
then, Ministers had not, during the last session, matured any measure
for the purpose, the Lord-Lieutenant is expected to assume the
responsibility of doing what seems to be regarded as the only way in
which public money can be applied to improving the waste lands—namely,
to improve them for the landlords. And under the terms of the recent
proclamation this may be, and to some extent we fear it will be, done.

There is something in this so exquisitely of a piece with all the doings
of England for Ireland’s good, and it is, besides, so fine a specimen of
the ideas of the English public concerning the mode in which a
Legislature should distribute its benefits, that it is altogether a very
rich exhibition of some of our national characteristics. Give to those
who have—that is the maxim of English politics. One gospel precept, at
least, we follow literally, “to him that hath shall be given.”1 But when
he that hath has got all that we can give him, it is his business to
take care of them that have not—and we know how, in general, he does so.
Here are four millions of acres of valueless land about to be made
valuable, and here are a noble squirearchy and aristocracy quite capable
of receiving it. Give it to them by all means. Once let them grasp it,
and you will see what they will do for the poor in the way of employment
and of charity. This really seems to be considered, by the majority of
minds, as the natural and necessary concatenation of ideas on the
subject, and a highly rational and virtuous course of conduct.

The singularity of the thing is, that it certainly is not the landlords
of Ireland that England, in the ready overflow of its liberality,
desires to benefit. It is the poor—the peasantry, and them only. The
landlords are decidedly unpopular: everybody grudges them what they
have, much less is anybody desirous of adding to their store. But really
the thing cannot be helped. They stand with their hands held out,
between our gift and the peasantry, and there is actually no means, at
least so everybody seems to think, of making it reach the peasantry by
any other way than through their pockets. It is curious; but so it is.
That the Edition: current; Page: [903] benefit could possibly be
bestowed directly upon those for whose sake we give it, and whom alone
we have any wish to benefit by it, is not so much an idea rejected by
us, as one which never enters into our minds at all.

The root of this is deeply seated in the inveterate habits which were
generated by a century and a half of oligarchical government, and which
we have scarcely yet begun to shake off. To do anything for the poor by
act of Parliament is a thing so unprecedented that it never presents
itself in the light of a possibility. The machinery of legislation never
suggests itself as an available means for such a purpose. When it is to
make the rich richer, yes; that is an approved and a customary course:
any project which assumes that form has a presumption in its favour. But
to make the poor less poor, by exactly the same means, is a novelty to
startle people. There have been in England plenty of inclosure bills,
plenty of waste land brought under culture, and who ever heard of giving
any of it to the poor? So far from it, that only after long struggles
has the principle been conceded (and a most transcendent stretch of
generosity was the concession thought), that compensation ought to be
made to the poor for what they actually lose, the whole of the gain
still going, as it has always gone, to swell the estates of the rich.
This is the misfortune; this is what makes men so slow to see what
common justice and common feeling dictate—because common justice and
common feeling have hitherto been strangers to this department of human
affairs, and it is some time before people learn to recognise their
voice. The poor are only thought of as the recipients of alms, and in
that character but too much. To give to the poor is thought meritorious,
but the only thing which it is ever supposed can be done by the
Legislature is, that if individuals do not voluntarily give to the poor,
it can compel them to do so. The very people who would employ the whole
public expenditure intended for the relief of the Irish poor in
enriching the Irish landlords, are indignant because those landlords do
not give to the poor, and would make laws to compel them. Then why not
give the waste lands to the poor, instead of adding to the domains of
the landlords, and then they will not need the alms you are so ready to
enforce.

The English nation owes a tremendous debt to the Irish people for
centuries of misgovernment, perpetrated mostly for no English interest
or purpose, but for the sole interest of that colony of English descent
who have got the lands of Ireland into their possession, and until of
late had all the powers of government. If ever compensation was due from
one people to another, this is the case for it. We have an opportunity
of making this compensation, in the most admirable form for the
permanent advantage of the receivers; in a form as well suited to
educate them into better habits and higher civilization, as our past
conduct was calculated to barbarise and anarchise, if the expression may
be permitted, even a civilised people. We have the unlooked-for, and, it
may be truly said, the unmerited privilege, of being able to do this
without cost to ourselves, beyond a mere advance of what we would most
readily bestow, without return, for the relief of Edition: current;
Page: [904] present misery. We have lands at our disposal, of such
quality, and in such abundance, as, if employed properly, would confer
on Ireland, instead of her present wretchedness, an economical state,
combining the best features of the English system with those of the most
prosperous nations of the Continent. And this splendid opportunity—such
perhaps as no nation ever had, of repairing its errors, and conferring
an inestimable benefit on those whom it has wronged—are we about to
throw it away? Are we about to reclaim and improve these millions of
acres for the purpose of bringing them under the cottier system? Can we
find nothing better to do with these lands, than an operation which,
when completed, will leave Ireland with merely a larger population, as
hungry, indolent, improvident, and justly exasperated as before, and
without that precious resource for relieving their poverty, and
elevating them as human beings, which it is our good fortune not yet to
have parted with? Are we, indeed, going to squander a treasure of
material wealth, which ought to be a treasure of still more valuable
moral wealth, and to squander it in the worst of ways—by lavishing it on
those who, of all persons connected with Ireland, have hitherto, as a
class, deserved least consideration, least respect, and even least
indulgence?

Whether there is virtue enough in England to prevent this, a few weeks,
or at most months, will decide.


314.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [8]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 21 OCT., 1846, P. 4

Mill’s discussion of fixity of tenure (in No. 311) had been criticized
in a letter to the editor: “State of Ireland,” by “N.,” Morning
Chronicle, 21 Oct., p. 5, from which Mill here quotes. For the context
of the series, see No. 306. This unheaded leader is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “An eighth leading article on Irish affairs, in the
Morning Chronicle of 21st Oct. 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 61).

in another column will be found a letter, signed “N.,” called forth by
the observations in our paper of the 14th, on fixity of tenure. The
writer charges us with recommending, “openly and without disguise, the
doctrine of general spoliation,” as applied to the landowners of
Ireland; with advising “glibly and smoothly, that a general confiscation
of the landed property of a whole country shall take place, and that
what now belongs to the landlord by a right as good as that by which any
man holds the coat that covers his back, shall henceforward be
transferred to the tenant.”

When at a moment the most critical perhaps in Irish history, either for
good or for evil, we endeavoured, so far as in us lay, that the
abundance of good and honest feeling which now exists in the English
Government and public towards Ireland, might not run to sheer waste for
want of thought; when on the first occasion upon which such an
exposition had a chance of being listened to, we Edition: current; Page:
[905] showed, as others before us had shown without effect, what is
really the root of Irish evils, how deep into the structure of Irish
society the remedy, if it is to be really a remedy, must penetrate, and
yet how easy, simple, and obvious it is, if they on whom it depends
would only have the courage to think so; when we commenced this task,
which we have not done without full conviction of the truth of the
principles we have advanced, and a firm determination to stand by them
to the utmost while that conviction remains unshaken, we were fully
prepared to expect that for some time our opinions and purpose would not
only be perversely misrepresented, but in many cases honestly
misunderstood. This is so inevitably the fate of all political ideas
beyond the strictest commonplace, as soon as there seems any possibility
of their becoming practical, that we should have been disappointed if we
had escaped the common lot; since an exemption would have proved to us
nothing more flattering than that what we had written, under some hope
of being useful, had not had the good fortune to excite any attention.

But although we were prepared for a good deal of misunderstanding, and
for a good deal of trouble in setting it right, we did think we had
sufficiently guarded against the particular misconception contained in
the letter of our correspondent, and which we are still convinced could
not have been fallen into by any one who had read our observations with
sufficient attention. It is hardly necessary to say to those who have
done so, that the plan technically called fixity of tenure is not our
plan; we did but pass it in review, as we did other plans, for the
purpose of rejecting it. And so little did we deserve our
correspondent’s animadversions, that after we had pointed out that under
certain modifications the scheme would not be a violation of property at
all, we rejected it even as so modified, because, though it had not the
reality, it would have the appearance of such a violation.

Without, however, occupying the reader any further with what we said
formerly, we will say now what we think on the subject. To bind down the
landlord in perpetuity to his present rent would be a spoliation of
property. It would be a confiscation of his contingent prospects of an
increase of income—a contingency which, in any progressive country, and
under anything but the most intolerable mismanagement, amounts to a
certainty, and which, like any other prospective gain, has its present
marketable value. It would mulct him of the difference between the
selling price of his land, and the price of a similar income secured on
mortgage or in the public funds. Viewed in this light, we disapprove it
as decidedly and should oppose it as strenuously as our correspondent,
though we certainly did not express ourselves in quite such indignant
language, for we confess that, however wrong we think them, we cannot
feel any very bitter indignation against those who, where a whole people
are the sufferers, propose desperate remedies for desperate diseases.1

Edition: current; Page: [906]
But we repeat, and we challenge who will to deny it, that the whole
injustice of fixity of tenure would be cured by pecuniary compensation,
and by a compensation strictly limited to the pecuniary loss. Whatever
the estate would lose in saleable value if the rent were converted into
a rent-charge, the landlord ought to receive, either from the tenant or
from the state, and could not without flagrant injustice be deprived of.
Receiving this, he would obtain the full measure of what is thought due
to those from whom their land is taken away, often against their
strongest protest, for public improvements. That is not accounted
plunder, and spoliation, and confiscation. What is not plunder when it
affects one person, or ten, or a hundred, is not plunder if applied to
five thousand. The number makes no difference in the justice of the
case, though it may in the policy, because the magnitude of the
transaction brings it into contact with great considerations of public
policy, which on the small scale it cannot possibly affect. The general
principle is the same in the great case as in the small. The Legislature
of the country can deal with the property of the country as expediency
requires, making compensation to the owners. This right is recognized by
every railroad or canal bill which passes through Parliament. The reform
of the social condition of a country is a greater object than any
railway bill. If that object could be no otherwise obtained than by
treating every landlord in Ireland as railway bills treat all persons
through whose property the railway is to be made, we feel assured that
our correspondent is not one of those who would be turned back by such
an obstacle.

But this measure would be a revolution in itself, and would require for
its justification that which justifies a revolution—a state of extreme
misgovernment and suffering, otherwise incurable. The first condition is
fully realised in Ireland, but the second is not. Milder remedies are
possible. This is the point we are labouring to prove, and we call
loudly upon our correspondent, and upon those who think with him, to
join in our endeavour. For they may be assured, that there is no other
mode of permanently averting the extremity which they so justly
deprecate. Unless those who have influence in Parliament and in the
public can find another remedy, and apply it too, they will not long
persuade an uneducated peasantry, who have never yet seen a friend in
the law, to respect the proprietary rights which the law gives, when
those rights have no sanction in their own feelings; and the choice may
soon lie between a real confiscation and a second Cromwellian conquest.2
The onus lies upon every English statesman or publicist, who has an
intellect and a conscience, to have an opinion upon what should be given
to Ireland instead of fixity of tenure; and not only to have an opinion
but to express it, and not only to express it but, within his sphere of
influence, to act upon it.

Edition: current; Page: [907]
In endeavouring to acquit ourselves of our share of this common
obligation, we have found it necessary to say that fixity of tenure,
though liable as a practical measure to insurmountable objections, has
yet one admirable quality, which the greater part of the schemes afloat
for Irish improvement have not, and the absence of which makes them so
futile and worthless. It gives to the cultivator a permanent interest in
the soil. In doing this it combines the greatest economical and the
greatest moral good of which Ireland in its present condition is
susceptible. And these two things are inseparable; both must be provided
for by any plan of improvement deserving the name. Without the moral
change, the greatest economical improvement will last no longer than a
prodigal’s bounty; without the economical change, the moral improvement
will not be attained at all. We say therefore, once more, that this
feature of the scheme of fixity of tenure must be found in any plan
which can be permanently useful to Ireland. The peasantry, or so
numerous a class of them as to be an example and a stimulus to the rest,
must have somewhere, and under some form, a proprietary interest in the
soil. Give them, we say, this proprietary interest in the lands now
unoccupied, which, fortunately, are more than sufficient for the
purpose, and not only will there be no temptation to encroach on the
rights of those who own the cultivated lands, but they will be delivered
from an insuperable difficulty and an insupportable burthen, and for the
first time will be really masters of the land called theirs. Every class
in the country, and almost every individual, would gain, even
pecuniarily, by the plan we support. It has no obstacle in men’s
interests, but only in the timidity and sluggishness of their minds.

The plan, too, has the advantage over fixity of tenure, that while
permanent benefit to the Irish people is at the end, the means may be
made instrumental to the relief of their immediate necessities. Our
correspondent imputes to us very gratuitously a gross absurdity when he
says that we “do not explain how, if all the tenants in Ireland were
tomorrow to be converted into owners of the patches of ground they
occupy, they would be able to raise, by taxation upon themselves, funds
to give to themselves wages to save themselves from the famine which at
present threatens them.” We were not then discussing plans of temporary
relief, but of permanent improvement, in which light alone fixity of
tenure ever was, or, except by an insane person, ever could be
advocated. But the plan we uphold unites both recommendations. Practised
on a sufficient scale, it would at once expel the acute disease by which
Ireland is now afflicted, and put things in a correct train for
permanently correcting her chronic and long-standing malady.

315.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [9]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 22 OCT., 1846, P. 4

For the context, see No. 306. This unheaded leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A ninth leading article on Irish affairs in the
Morning Chronicle of 22d Oct. 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 61).

the dublin freeman’s journal of Saturday last, in an article occasioned
by the opinions we have promulgated respecting the disposal of the waste
lands (opinions to which, as we are pleased, but not surprised, to find,
that influential paper gives its cordial assent), bears the following
valuable testimony to the complete practicability of the reclamation of
those lands by peasant labour:

A week’s ramble through Connemara, or Erris, or Kerry, and we presume
the same to be true of other counties where the waste lands abound, will
convince the most sceptical that labour can be profitably employed in
the reclamation even of such lands as would not prove remunerative to
the large capitalist. The Irish peasant’s labour was hitherto of little
value in the market. Labour was abundant, employment scarce; and
whenever the peasant found an opportunity of mingling his labour with
the barren soil, he did so, though with no better prospect than that of
having the owner of the soil come in and possess himself of the
permanent fruits of his toil, before he had himself reaped even what
would pay him a tithe of the value of his labour. We have seen this
process repeated many times by the same peasant family. We have seen him
reclaim a patch of bog, enjoy it for a brief period, and then yield it
to a rent-payer; then retire to another patch, to reclaim and yield it
up in like manner, and so on, labouring with the full conviction that
one day or other his lord would have all the benefit, but ever hoping,
even against experience, that the evil day might be far off. The peasant
family did this because their time was valueless, and by such a process
they were enabled to make it yield them a sustenance equivalent,
perhaps, to a fifth of its market value. Yet that fractional payment
kept them from begging, and rendered what would otherwise continue to be
barren soil, productive and valuable.1

Sic vos non vobis!2 Are these the purposes for which landed property is
ordained in a country pretending to civilization? Is it that he who sows
may not reap3—that not he who toils, but some other, may receive the
benefit? We all know the foundation and justification of the institution
of property to be precisely the reverse. The moral and social basis of
the right of property is the right of the labourer to the fruits of his
labour. All other proprietary rights exist for the sake of this. The
millionnaire, who never did a day’s work of useful labour with head or
hands, who is society’s debtor for every thing, and its creditor for
nothing, has Edition: current; Page: [909] his property protected, not
for its own sake, nor for his, but because to meddle with it would be to
violate the right which some ancestor or predecessor, who did work for
it, had to transmit it freely to his descendants, or to persons of his
choice. If all property rests upon no other than this foundation, landed
property does so pre-eminently. Land is not the produce of labour. No
landlord’s ancestor made the land.4 Why then is land appropriated? We do
not mean, why was it appropriated, for we know that the most usual
ground of possession was force and conquest: but why is its
appropriation rightful? Why is property in land a recognized necessity
of society? on what ground have, not usurpers and tyrants, but sages and
philanthropists, defended it? On this—that land, although not made by
labour, can only be rendered useful by it, and because labour will not
be applied in the most useful manner by the exertions of any others than
those who have a permanent interest in the land.

Land might be held in common, or, what would be less irrational, it
might be granted out on yearly leases by the State. It is conceded to
individuals in permanent property for one legitimate reason only,
because a permanent proprietor has the strongest motive to be an
improver. Proprietors exist in order that they may be improvers, not in
order that they may profit by improvements made by others. When the
proprietors of land, generally speaking, are not improvers, the purposes
for which landed property exists are not answered. When, instead of
being improvers, they are an obstacle to improvement—when, without any
public purpose in view, they keep land waste which others are eager to
cultivate, or suffer it to be made valuable by those who have no
permanent interest in it, in order to seize on the value—we do not say
that they are culpable. The law gave them the land, attaching no
conditions to the gift, and none but an extraordinary man is a law to
himself,5 according to a higher standard than custom. But we do say that
landed property, thus used, exists to frustrate the ends which it is
designed to promote. It is instituted that improvement may not be
hindered; it exists as the hindrance. It is instituted that what is
created by industry may abide with the creators; it exists that what
their labour alone has called into being, may be wrung from them.

Seeing what the “indolent Celt”6 is already found capable of achieving,
without the stimulus of property—seeing that the mere prospect of a few
years precarious possession has so often induced him, without science,
without capital, without aid from the possessors of either, not under
the encouragement of law, but in violation of it, with no resource but
his own hands, and those of his family, to perform what is regarded as
one of the most arduous feats of agricultural Edition: current; Page:
[910] improvement, the conversion of peat-bog into arable land; we are
justified in believing that if the primeval waste had stood open in the
primeval manner to the first occupier, as the prize of him who succeeded
in making it valuable, it would long ere this have been covered from one
end to the other by a hard-working, frugal, peaceable, and, in all
probability, prudent and self-restraining peasant proprietary. Society,
which maintains landed property in order that cultivation may thrive,
has prevented all this cultivation, by granting to certain persons, over
land which they did not use, the power of prohibiting all other persons
from using it. What was this done for? What end had society in view in
it? What benefit has society reaped from it? What equivalent have its
favourites returned to it for the gift? That which was meant as an
exclusive right to use the land they have turned into a veto on the use.
“Hitherto,” in the words of the Freeman’s Journal,

Irish proprietors almost instinctively looked to the mountains and bogs
on their estates as so many grouse-moors and snipe-marshes from which it
was their duty to repel the approaches of industry. The Legislature
encouraged this sentiment by every possible means, and even seemed to
think it a part of its duty to offer every possible obstacle to the
introduction of an extended system of improvement.7

Let the Legislature, then, repair its error. The rights it has
conferred, mischievous and anti-social as they have in fact proved, let
it not resume without compensation. Those rights have a market value,
and let that value be paid to the last penny. But let it be the present
value, not a speculative price, grounded on the improvements which are
only to be effected by means of the purchase. The value of the bogs and
mountains to their nominal owners is but a trifle. They are entitled to
no more; what more the Legislature can spare is required to feed the
industrious improvers, while they work for their own future
independence, and the State will be amply repaid by a fraction of the
value which their labour will bestow on the now worthless land.


316.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [10]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 23 OCT., 1846, P. 4

Mill here discusses the waste-land reclamation plan of Poulett Scrope,
which had been recently reiterated in a letter to Lord John Russell (20
Oct., 1846), Morning Chronicle, 21 Oct., p. 5, from which the quotations
are taken. See Nos. 320, 322, 326, 341, 345, and 348 for further
arguments with Scrope. For the context of the series, see No. 306. This
unheaded leader is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A tenth leading
article on Irish affairs, in the Morning Chronicle of 23d October 1846
(the second leader)” (MacMinn, p. 61). As in the case of No. 313, Mill
specifies the second leader probably because the first also pertains to
Ireland.

Edition: current; Page: [911]
in the plan which we have suggested for making the waste lands of
Ireland instrumental to the creation of that invaluable element in the
social condition of nations, a peasant proprietary, we had been
anticipated not only in the excellent work of Mr. William Thornton,1 but
in some measure by Mr. Poulett Scrope. That gentleman introduced a bill
into Parliament during the last session, to facilitate the reclaiming of
Irish waste lands;2 and in a letter to Lord John Russell, published in
our paper of Wednesday, he opportunely reminds us that his plan was
favourably looked upon by the present Government, and recapitulates its
chief provisions.

The main principle of his measure, as stated by himself,

was, that the Board of Works should be empowered to purchase, at their
present value, any portions of the waste lands of Ireland (in the same
manner as a railway company takes the lands it requires for its
purposes), and to set to work to drain and commence the reclamation of
such tracts, in any or every part of Ireland, wherever they should think
fit, funds being advanced, of course, by the Treasury; that as fast as
any such lands became fitted for cultivation they should be divided into
small or moderate-sized farms, houses built on them, and either sold
outright or leased for ninety-nine years at a quit-rent, with the option
to the occupier to purchase at any time, or by instalments, under strict
covenants not to subdivide or sublet.

Mr. Scrope sets forth, in language which we most fully adopt, the
manifold advantages of this over the other plans for meeting the
existing emergency. That the relief afforded would be not only a
productive expenditure, but the most productive which the circumstances
of Ireland admit of; that, lucrative as the work would be, it can
scarcely be effected without the assumption of a power by Government,
since it must be done by deepening the water-courses throughout large
tracts of country, for which either compulsory authority, or the consent
of every individual proprietor is indispensable; that the profit would
be reaped, as it ought to be, not by the class of landlords but by the
State; that even in the first year following the operation, a large
addition would be made to the food of the country. Lastly—and we quote
this sentence with particular pleasure—

the means would be provided of locating a body of some hundred thousand
of the peasantry of Ireland on lands of their own—of creating a body of
small proprietors, such as in Belgium, France, Norway, and Switzerland,
offering examples of greater prudence, self-restraint, and productive
industry, the very qualities so much required in Ireland, than are to be
found among any tenants-at-will or rack-rented leaseholders in the
world.

Differing, as we do most widely, from Mr. Scrope’s opinions on Irish
poor-laws,3 it is a satisfaction to be in such complete accordance
respecting the Edition: current; Page: [912] social condition to which,
though by far other means than poor-laws, we wish to raise the Irish
people. And we rejoice to think that if the Government fail to make this
great question their own, there is an independent and zealous member of
Parliament who is virtually pledged to bring it under the consideration
of the Legislature. We suspect, however, that there would be found,
along with much agreement, a certain amount of difference between Mr.
Scrope’s view of the question and our own; and it will enable us to
bring certain features of the subject into bolder relief, if we briefly
state what we conceive these points of difference would be.

It seems to us that in Mr. Scrope’s plan of location on waste lands, no
less than in his poor-law plan, the increase of the produce, and in
particular of the food of the country, is the primary object; and that
this should be done with profit to the State appears to be the second.
The creation of a peasant proprietary seems to him desirable, but
apparently stands only in the third rank. In our minds the order of
precedency is very different. After the people are saved from present
starvation, which must be presupposed in all plans, the formation of a
peasant proprietary should, in our opinion, be the first object; all
other things are of secondary importance. It is on that we have to rely
for the permanent usefulness of all the rest. We look with comparative
indifference on any scheme of improvement which begins and ends with
increase of food. We desiderate a guarantee that increase of food shall
have some better permanent consequence than increase of mouths. That
guarantee must be something operating upon the minds of the people, and
not merely upon their stomachs. They must have something to strive for,
some object of rational ambition. They must have something placed before
them which shall make new men of them; men such as Mr. Scrope truly
describes the small proprietors of Belgium, France, Norway, and
Switzerland to be—examples not only of “productive industry,” but of
“prudence and self-restraint.” That plan, therefore, is in our view the
best which, without making the subdivision too minute, creates the most
numerous class of small proprietors; a class the most acted on by
prudential motives, and whose existence tends most to strengthen those
motives in the minds of others, of all classes who live by the labour of
their hands.

With this view we would relinquish all idea of profit to the State. Mr.
Scrope’s plan makes this consideration paramount to the more important
object. He would have the State reclaim the land, bring it into thorough
order, build houses on it, and then sell it, or lease it for ninety-nine
years—we presume at its market value. But long leases, even with the
option of purchase, would very slowly raise up a proprietary; and sales
to the highest bidder might attract proprietors with capital from
elsewhere, but would, we are afraid, create few such from among the
Irish peasantry. In our view, the State should be abundantly satisfied
with not being a loser; it should content itself with simple interest on
its advances. Neither should it undertake the whole improvement of the
land, but only that part of the Edition: current; Page: [913] operation
which cannot be effectually done otherwise than by combined labour. If
the State erects houses and farm buildings, it will make them too good
for the existing peasantry, too costly to begin with, and too
troublesome to have any chance of being kept up. The people themselves
should do all the work of improvement which they are capable of. It is
precisely that which will sift the more energetic portion of the
population from the rest, and discriminate those in whose hands the
experiment is most likely to thrive. That the thing can be done, even
now, by the peasantry, if the law permits, and if they are supplied with
food in the meantime, we already know. Let them build their own
cottages. At first it is likely that those they built would be as much
too bad as those built for them would be too good. No matter. Trust to
time, and the gradual influence of the change in their condition. Trust
to the feeling of proprietorship, that never-failing source of local
attachments. When the cottage is theirs—when the land which surrounds it
is theirs—there will be a pleasure in enlarging, and improving, and
adorning the one and the other. When the peasant feels that he is
somebody—that he counts for something on the earth—that he also is one
of those for whose sake the institutions of society exist, the
consciousness will have the same effect on him which it now has on those
above him, and he will not choose to live in wretchedness and squalor on
the land which is his own.


317.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [11]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 26 OCT., 1846, P. 4

For the context, see No. 306. This unheaded leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “An eleventh leading article on Irish affairs in
the Morning Chronicle of 26th October 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 61).

among those who acknowledge the immediate source of the poverty of the
Irish people to be local over-population—estates crowded with a greater
number of people than are needful or useful for their cultivation—among
such persons, from Archbishop Whately and the Commissioners of Irish
Poor-law Inquiry, down to the Marquess of Westmeath, the favourite
remedy for Irish maladies has been an extensive emigration.1

Of emigration, in principle, and as a general question, it is far from
our intention to speak with disparagement. It ought to form a regular
department of the general policy of the country. To facilitate the
transfer of human muscular Edition: current; Page: [914] power from
those parts of the British dominions where it is superabundant and cheap
to those where it is scarce and dear, from those where its productive
powers are small to those where they are great, is a highly appropriate
function of the Sovereign authority. The State ought to keep a bridge
open (metaphorically speaking) between the country and its colonies, and
to see that the passage over this bridge be as cheap and as convenient
as possible. The way, too, has been pointed out in which any given
amount of emigration may gift the colonies with the greatest amount of
productive power, may afford the greatest relief to the labour market at
home, and, finally, may defray its own expenses, the sole outlay
required being an advance which would be repaid with interest. We refer,
of course, to the plans and suggestions of Mr. Wakefield.2 Colonization
on his scheme, or even on a scheme far inferior to his, we desire to see
extensively practised, not only as a provision for that portion of the
labouring people who may choose to emigrate, but as the sole means of
securing the perpetual growth of new and opulent customers,
proportionally to the probable increase of the manufacturing population
at home.

But, while we look with much favour upon systematic emigration as a
branch of the general arrangements for maintaining a good economical
condition, we do not think it equally well adapted for reforming a bad
one, at least when the evil is excessive, and we think it peculiarly
unsuited to the present condition of Ireland.

In the first place, how are the people to be induced to go? No one, we
presume, contemplates the use of compulsion; unless, perhaps, the
compulsion implied in telling them that if they will not emigrate they
may starve. But this is not a very safe thing to be told to several
millions of persons; who, probably, would not feel bound to submit to
the alternative of death or banishment, in order that their masters,
having got rid of the people, might make more money of the land. The
attachment of Irish peasants to their native country is proverbial; and
were it less so, they would hardly see any good reason for sending them
across the sea to colonize Australia or Canada, when a portion of
Ireland, sufficient to contain their whole number, is still to colonize.
And can there be any comparison between the advantage of these two modes
of locating the surplus population? In the one, they are placed in a new
field, where the experience of their previous lives can neither be a
guide nor an assurance to them; in a strange climate, exposed to strange
diseases, with necessities which they never before felt, their work, a
great part of it, new, and all of it to be done with new tools, and in a
new set of circumstances; while they might have food, employment, and
independence at home, by work to which they are thoroughly competent,
and differing from their present occupations no otherwise than in being
done for themselves, and on their own possessions. Why offer them landed
property at the other side of the globe, when there is landed property
vacant at their very door, Edition: current; Page: [915] capable of
being made fit for their use with half the labour, and at a mere
fraction of the expense?

For the expense of emigration would be enormous; and we could scarcely
expect that, like the expense of locating the people on the waste lands,
it would ever be repaid. The self-supporting system is not adapted to
carry off great numbers at once. It can only be brought into operation
very gradually: its principle is, that the first who emigrate create by
their labour both the means of transporting, and the fund for employing,
those who follow. But a gradual process, to a people in the condition of
the Irish, is a useless process. We do not mean this solely with
reference to the potato famine. We should say it of the Irish as they
were three years ago, no less than of the Irish as they are. Any relief
of the labour market has a chance of being permanent only when it is
great and sudden. If it drains off in a year no greater number than the
yearly increase it does nothing. Unless it subtracts a sufficient number
at once, and diminishes sufficiently the competition for employment to
make the remainder feel themselves decidedly raised in the scale of
physical comfort, it will make no change in the habits of the people,
and the vacuum created will speedily be again filled up. In Ireland
nothing permanent would be accomplished unless the number removed were
sufficient to extinguish the cottier system; that is, unless the
residuary population were reduced to the number who could find regular
employment as labourers on the English or Scotch system. To do this is
far beyond the powers of the self-supporting plan. The whole of this
great number must be conveyed to the colonies, and probably far into
their interior, at the expense of Government; and, when there, all must
be provided with shelter, expensive tools, and more than a year’s
subsistence, since the first year would be required for the laborious
operation of clearing the primeval forest. It is probably within the
mark to say that this expense would be tenfold that of locating the same
number of families on Irish land; and experience has shown that such
advances, made to settlers in the wilderness, are never repaid.

There are other considerations, pertinent to the subject, which we can
only glance at. It is a serious question whether, in laying the
foundation of new nations beyond the sea, it be right that the Irish
branch of the human family should be the predominant ingredient. That it
should enter into the admixture is desirable, and perhaps largely,
especially when the other element is composed of the Saxon race, which
needs to be tempered by amalgamation with the more excitable and
imaginative constitution and the more generous impulses of its Celtic
kinsfolk. But Ireland must be an altered country at home before we can
wish to create an Ireland in every quarter of the globe, and it is not
well to select as missionaries of civilization a people who, in so great
a degree, yet remain to be civilized.

Waiving this, however, and supposing the whole surplus population
removed by their own consent, and with the happiest success, to Upper
Canada or New Edition: current; Page: [916] Zealand, how much will have
been effected for those who remain at home? The cottier system, perhaps,
might be extirpated; and this is much. The peasantry would be in regular
employment as hired labourers, on good-sized and well-stocked farms,
under capitalist farmers, mostly Scotch or English, cultivating on their
national model. This would be good for the landlords, good for these
Scotch and English farmers, good for the State, which would gain a quiet
life and a larger revenue, and good even for the peasantry, in
comparison with their present condition; but, we venture to say, not
good when compared with what they might and should be. What is there in
this change of condition to regenerate their character? What is there to
make their slack labour vigorous, to convert their listlessness into
activity, their careless self-indulgence into forethought and prudence?
Property in land has this power. It acts like magic, both on those who
have it, and on those who, by exertion and frugality, can hope to obtain
it. Nowhere has such a virtue been found to reside in labour for hire,
without hope of better—labour for hire from infancy to old age—as the
permanent condition of the whole labouring class. There is no country,
that we know of, but Great Britain, where that constitution of society
prevails universally, and we doubt if there be any other where it would
be compatible with vigorous industry, and great efficiency for labour.
The dogged tenacity of work, which is the chief source of England’s
industrial superiority, depends on peculiar circumstances of national
character, whether inherent in the race, or, as is far more probable,
produced by peculiarities of historical development. Other nations will
work as hard, but it must be for a strong motive: in England the work
itself might almost seem to be the motive. We are not sure that it would
be doing the Irish a service to make them Englishmen; but we are sure
that they are not Englishmen, and cannot, by any device of ours, be made
so. To make them work, they must have what makes their Celtic brethren,
the French peasantry, work, and those of Tuscany, of the self-indulgent
and luxurious south. They must work, not for employers, but for
themselves. Their labour must not be for wages only, it must be a labour
of love—the love which the peasant feels for the spot of land from which
no man’s pleasure can expel him, which makes him a free and independent
citizen of the world, and in which every improvement which his labour
can effect belongs to his family as their permanent inheritance.


318.: THE SUICIDE OF SARAH BROWN
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 28 OCT., 1846, P. 4

This is the fourth of the leaders on injustice and cruelty by Harriet
Taylor and Mill (see No. 303). The unheaded leader (the second) is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “A leading article on the suicide of
one Sarah Brown, in the Morning Chronicle of 28th Oct. 1846. A joint
production.”

(MacMinn, p. 62.)

Edition: current; Page: [917]
in a paragraph which has gone the round of the daily papers, it is
stated that on Thursday last Mr. Bedford held an inquest, at the Star
and Garter, St. Martin’s-lane, on the body of Sarah Brown, aged
nineteen, who had drowned herself in the Thames. “Deceased, the daughter
of respectable parents, was seduced by a gentleman two years ago, and
had a child by him. Her seducer deprived her of her child.” Several
witnesses, it is added, “proved that since her child had been taken from
her she had over and over again threatened to destroy herself.” The
verdict was temporary insanity.1

The sad history of this poor girl might not have had so tragical a
dénouement, if there had been any one to inform her that the creature
called “a gentleman,” in tearing from her the last consolation and the
last human interest which he had left her, acted as much in defiance of
law as of the first elements of justice and feelings of humanity; that
the father of an illegitimate child has absolutely no legal rights over
the child; that he is, in the eye of the law, not related to it; and
that its mother is its sole parent.2 But this piece of legal knowledge,
though perfectly elementary, appears to be too recondite for some
magistrates, judging from a case published in the police reports a short
time since.3 In that case, as in this, the father had exerted the law of
the strongest, and kept the child to himself. The mother had retaliated
by the law of the cleverest, and had stolen it back. The man again
seized on it, and the case ultimately came before a magistrate, who,
according to the report, awarded that they should possess the child in
alternate months. The magistrate, possibly, may have been guided to this
adjudication by some indistinct reminiscence of the judgment of
Solomon;4 but there was no similarity in the result, which was, that the
disputants were no sooner out of court than they renewed their squabble,
to determine which of the two should be entitled to the first month, a
point which the magistrate, in his anxiety for equal partition, had
forgotten to decide. The matter was at last amicably adjusted, and
“ended happily”—for the most serious situation of life is equally
capable of being the subject of a comedy or of a tragedy. But if the
magistrate acted in any other capacity than as an adviser of the
parties, and meant anything more than to suggest a compromise to be
voluntarily adopted by them, he evidently violated the law. He had no
right to compel the woman to give up one-half of her child. She paid
dearly enough for it, and it was her’s, and her’s it ought to be—most
certainly no one’s else. She had a legal and a moral right to such
comfort as it could afford her, and she had a right to any hold over the
man, who had deserted Edition: current; Page: [918] her, that might be
derived from the interest which it appears he had not ceased to feel in
the child. If any limitation of her exclusive parental control could be
allowable, it is not by or for the man, but by that which we should be
glad to see exercised, not only in cases of this kind, but in many
others—the tutelary intervention of a public authority, to see that the
children of the miserable are not brought up to be miserable, or a
source of misery to others.

In the case of lawful marriage, the law has thought fit to give to one
only of the parents—that one being (need it be said?) the one who by
himself or by his representatives makes the law—exclusive power over the
children. The revolting excess of injustice, palpable even to the
obtusest perceptions, which resulted from this provision of the law in
certain extreme cases, induced the Legislature a few years back, on the
proposition of Mr. Sergeant Talfourd, slightly to relax in those extreme
cases the rigour of the exclusive principle.5 How much more remains to
be done in the same direction, before the state of the law can commend
itself either to the reason or to the feelings of any one who views it
not as an interested party, but as an impartial judge, we shall not at
present discuss. The law, however, is not guilty of giving this excess
of power, without annexing any conditions to it. Whatever the authority
with which the law arms the father, it requires of him, as an essential
preliminary, not only that he shall stand clear of having acquired his
claim by the destruction of the social position, and in all probability
the self-respect of a fellow-creature, but that he shall take upon
himself all the obligations and responsibilities which, in the
estimation of the law, ought to devolve upon one who, for his own
purposes, presumes to call a human being into existence. He can claim
none of the rights attaching to a position of which he does not fulfil
the requirements. He cannot indulge himself in despotism as the
patriarch of a family, and give himself a dispensation from extending to
either the children or their other parent reciprocal (however unequal)
rights over him.

If the father has not chosen to make himself liable legally to the
obligations which, from the very nature of the case, belong morally to
the parental condition, those obligations and responsibilities devolve
undividedly upon the other parent, and along with them, as their
inseparable accompaniment, those rights over the child’s person and
conduct, which have no legitimate ground of existence save as a means to
the fulfilment of those obligations, or a reward and encouragement for
fulfilling them conscientiously. And since this not only ought to be the
law, but actually is so, it is wrong in any magistrate not to take every
appropriate opportunity of making it known; for this end, among others,
that one-half of the Edition: current; Page: [919] human species may
occasionally have the satisfaction of believing that if the law is
appealed to in their behalf it will do them justice.

At present it is very well known that women, in the lower ranks of life,
do not expect justice from a bench or a jury of the male sex. They feel
the most complete assurance that to the utmost limits of common decency,
and often beyond, a tribunal of men will sympathize and take part with
the man. And accordingly they die in protracted torture, from
incessantly repeated brutality, without ever, except in the fewest and
rarest instances, claiming the protection of law. If justice is invoked,
it is generally by the outraged feelings of neighbours, and if the
unhappy sufferer deviates into making her injuries known in a police
court, at the next hearing she usually retracts everything; for who ever
heard of a really severe punishment inflicted upon a man for any amount
of brutal ill-treatment of his wife? She knows well that if the case is
too clear and strong to allow of dismissing the man with a reprimand,
and the woman with a piece of kind advice to be gentle and submissive,
the utmost he will have to undergo is a month or two months
imprisonment, to be followed by a resumption of all his former power,
and her imagination can well suggest with what consequences to her.

If such is the justice society deals out to those women, in the humbler
classes, whom it calls respectable, what must an unfortunate creature
like Sarah Brown expect? And who can wonder, that driven to desperation
by the cruellest wrong, though a wrong wholly unsanctioned by law, she
seeks relief not from a magistrate but from suicide, without having had
even a momentary thought that the law would do anything for her, or that
the law was anything but one of the instruments by which society hunts
down those who have violated its rules and incurred its displeasure?


319.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [12]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 29 OCT., 1846, P. 4

For the context, see No. 306. This unheaded first leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A twelfth leading article on Irish affairs in
the Morning Chronicle of 29th Oct. 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 62).

we regard it as certain that the immense capabilities of the six million
acres of waste lands will be, in some shape, put in requisition to
relieve the immediate destitution of the Irish peasantry in such a way
as to augment the permanent wealth and the permanent stock of food in
the country, and that some plan with this for its object, and from the
necessity of the case probably an extensive one, will be introduced to
the Legislature by Ministers in the coming session, which Edition:
current; Page: [920] may be near at hand.1 Our fears are not on this
point, but they are lest this should be all; lest the relief of the
temporary exigency should be deemed enough; lest there should be no
heart or hope for undertaking the nobler enterprise of curing a
radically diseased economical system; lest the unrivalled facilities
which this emergency has brought within our reach, for doing a century’s
work of Irish civilization in a single year, should be allowed to slip
away from us, not from indifference to the object, but from that easy,
contented resignation and despair of doing good, which has the same
practical effect.

It is not to be denied, that the obstacles in the way of Ministers are
formidable. They will actually have to disregard the whole of their
usual advisers. They will really be in the hard case of having to go
before the public with a plan, on the sole strength of reason and their
own conviction of right. We are not ignorant how arduous a task we are
requiring of them, and how little ground experience gives for expecting
such an amount of self-reliance in any Cabinet of mortal men.
Nevertheless we have sufficient faith in the change of times, and in the
evidence which the present Prime Minister2 has given of participating in
that change, to have some hope that he will dare decide that two and two
are four, although it may have been laid down that they are five in all
the traditions of Irish government. Ministers will be besieged on all
sides with applications to improve the lands for the benefit of the
landlords. From all people in Ireland itself to whom they are in the
habit of listening, they will meet with no other advice. There are but
two influential interests in Ireland—a landlord interest, and a lawyer
interest. The landed interest, Orange,3 Liberal, and Repeal—for they are
all alike where landlordism is concerned—will gape wide-mouthed for the
gift of fertile lands, which they hope will be offered them in lieu of
the worthless waste. The lawyer interest, which together with the
landlord interest comprises all the advisers of the Castle,4 will sound
the alarm in defence of an imaginary idol called Rights of Property,
which stands in no relation to the real, legitimate principle of
property, except a relation of contrariety. They will represent as
blasphemy against this idol the suggestion of making the six millions of
acres useful, for the benefit of any persons other than those who have
so fully exercised the right of not using them since the days of
Strafford or Strongbow.5 Edition: current; Page: [921] There is a class
of minds in the world, in whose opinion parchments were not made for
man, but man for parchments. As there were in Judea pedants in the
matter of the sabbath who were rebuked in the manner we know,6 so there
are pedants everywhere in the matter of property, and we are too well
aware of the inherent necessities of human infirmity not to have as much
indulgence as we in conscience may towards the amiable weakness. We will
therefore concede that the eleven millions of acres, by courtesy called
cultivated, now extant between Donegal and Cork, were evoked from the
“azure main,”7 in order that some gentlemen in superfine coats who
inhabit large houses in Ireland, and others who live in lodgings at
Cheltenham, Paris, and Rome, together with their amiable ladies and
smiling children, may be supported in elegant leisure on the fruits
thereof; but we demur to admitting as much concerning the six millions,
which have never yet produced any fruits susceptible of the same
honourable destination. On the subject of those, we should say to the
landlords—Gentlemen, you have had five centuries to try what use you
could make of these lands. In that time you have not contrived to make
them yield any produce or profit even to your distinguished selves. If
in any one year—if six months ago—you had done one overt act, had moved
one sod towards rendering these lands useful, either to yourselves or
others, whatever you had even touched with that object in view, you
should have had our free leave to keep as your own. But you have not
done it; and the time is now come when a public necessity requires that
what you have omitted to do should be done for the general good by the
representative and organ of the general good—the State. We are going to
take the land from you; to enter it, and do as we please with it, for
the purpose of rendering it productive, whether with your leave or
without. Now, therefore, your modest proposition is, that after we have
drained, fenced, built upon, and manured this land, and made it worth as
many hundreds of pounds as it is now worth shillings, we shall,
reserving only a mortgage to the amount of our expenses, give it back to
you. And this you demand in the name of property. But, by your leave,
your right of property stands good only for the shillings. Those, nobody
thinks of refusing you: but the pounds which will be added to those
shillings by our capital, and by the labour of Irish peasants, are
either theirs or ours, not yours; and to make them yours would not be
restoring your own property, but presenting you with a large and
gratuitous estate in addition. Now, this is a thing which you must
absolutely reconcile yourselves to doing without. It will not, cannot,
shall not be done. We are not so charmed with the use you have made of
what is already yours, as to be desirous of adding more to it; and
besides, there are really other people who must Edition: current; Page:
[922] be thought of before you. Your necessities, we own, are great, but
those of seven millions of poverty-stricken peasantry are greater. We
must take care of those first. We must give them justice before we give
you charity. Console yourselves with the reflection, that by doing for
these people what you have failed to do, we shall at the same time
relieve your estates from what you perpetually complain of as their
greatest burthen; a burthen which must indeed be insupportable, for
otherwise, men with the charitable feelings you lay claim to would not
surely be driven to ridding themselves of it by turning out a whole
tenantry on the high roads, to perish of hunger, or find in beggars like
themselves the mercy they had not experienced from the rich man who had
lived on their labour. What you can only effect for yourselves by means
like these, we are going to do for you, freely and effectually. Let that
suffice you.

The Nation, in a spirited article on Saturday last (which we have
pleasure in noticing, as the complete adhesion of the powerful
representative of “Young Ireland” both to the plan we have proposed, and
to the principles, more comprehensive than any plan, on which we defend
it), thus emphatically warns the “landed interest” of Ireland:

See the blindness of Irish landlords—see how they are suffering the
ground to slip from under their feet—how the problem to be solved comes
more formidably before them every time it reappears. Eleven years ago,
if they had unanimously urged on Government to adopt the plan of the
select committee,8 they might have had the lands reclaimed, and
inhabited by their own tenants. Now, all men seem disposed to deny them
all claim to this; and the world cries out—“At least on this new land
let us see no more cottiers or con-acre—on this virgin soil let a race
grow up who may call their hearths and their souls their own.”

And even now, if the Irish proprietors would cordially accept the terms,
they might save their territorial privileges over the present arable and
pasture, with all their woods and waters, timber and minerals, and all
the rest of it. But let a year or two more go round—let public works’
commissioners and engineering tourists, and the gentlemanlike
officialities of Dublin Castle, devour the heart of Ireland but a little
longer—and when the Sybilline books are offered once more to these
landed Tarquins,9 they will, from the bottom of their hearts, wish they
had bethought them sooner of the requirements of the time.

In all sincerity we say to them, we earnestly pray that the Irish people
may be enabled to keep body and soul together without devouring them.10

320.: POULETT SCROPE ON THE POOR LAWS
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 31 OCT., 1846, P. 4

This article is connected with, though not part of, the major series on
Irish affairs beginning with No. 306, in which Mill first attacked
Scrope’s proposed Poor Law Bill. Here Mill continues the discussion of
Scrope’s proposals for Ireland that he began on 23 Oct. (No. 316); on
the poor laws, see also Nos. 322, 326, 341, and 345. Earlier in the
year, Scrope had published a collection of his Letters to the Right Hon.
Lord John Russell, on the Expediency of Enlarging the Irish Poor-Law to
the Full Extent of the Poor-Law of England (London: Ridgway, 1846). A
review by Nassau Senior, “Proposals for Extending the Irish Poor Law,”
Edinburgh Review, LXXXIV (Oct. 1846), 267-314, had particularly
condemned Scrope’s advocacy of relief to the able-bodied in the form of
outdoor work. Scrope replied in “The Edinburgh Review and Mr. Poulett
Scrope,” The Times, 27 Oct., p. 2, and a leading article on p. 4 of the
same issue supported him. Mill’s unheaded second leader is described in
his bibliography as “A leading article on Poor Laws, in the Morning
Chronicle of 31st October 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 62).

our friend mr. poulett scrope, after making public his views of Irish
affairs, in letters addressed to Lord John Russell through our columns,
has promulgated a defence of those letters against the Edinburgh Review
through the more congenial medium of last Tuesday’s Times. Nearly a page
of our contemporary’s broad sheet was covered by Mr. Scrope’s
lucubrations, together with an editorial article to which they formed
the text; and if assumed contempt on the part of one assailant, and very
genuine anger on that of another, amount to refutation, the Edinburgh
reviewer may consider himself well answered.

It is not particularly our part to stand up for the writer in the
Edinburgh Review. We are concerned with the questions he discusses and
the principles he propounds—not with him. We do not agree in all his
opinions, though we do in every one of the main points of his argument.
But he has rendered a great service, and one which was greatly needed,
in re-stating at this time, clearly and forcibly, and with consummate
knowledge of his subject, the facts and arguments which irrevocably
condemn the system of poor-law management advocated by the Times and by
Mr. Scrope. The most cutting thing which his two opponents can find to
say against him is, that these facts and arguments are old. We were not
aware that truths became superannuated by years; we submit that
doctrines are never antiquated until they have been answered. When
assumption and abuse are repeated every day, sense and reason, in
opposition to them, will surely bear repetition once a year. The world
would otherwise forget on which side the weight of truth and argument
really is. The extreme emptiness of Edition: current; Page: [924]
everything written against the present Poor-Law dispenses indeed with a
very frequent or formal reiteration of the grounds of its justification.
We remember no case in our time, of a great public controversy so long
pending, in which the reasons were so entirely on one side. The assaults
do not ground themselves on reason at all, but are mere appeals to
feeling, deriving their main strength from the occasional, and we are
bound to say frequent, disclosure of cases of abuse, such as occur in
all systems, but, under any other than a centralized system, occur
without detection; and the law is condemned precisely for one of the
main features of its usefulness. Under what poor law, before the
present, has the English nation had its attention riveted, during many
weeks, on the mismanagement of one workhouse in a small country town?1
But there is a plenteous stock of people at all times who think that
whenever they hear much about an evil, there is more of it, and that
letting in daylight upon the miseries and vices of society is the same
thing as causing them. These are the people who make outcries about
increase of crime whenever a more vigilant magistracy, or a more active
police, effect a greater number of apprehensions. And there is never any
deficiency of declaimers, by speech or writing, to play upon the simple
minds of these often very good kind of people, and use them for a
purpose.

We are willing, nay eager, to go any lengths with those who demand a
vigorous repression and prevention of such detestable tyranny and
scarcely less detestable negligence as have been brought to light in
some of the recent workhouse investigations. Instead of too strong a
feeling on these points, we do not think the feeling half strong enough.
Hardly anybody reflects sufficiently what a mass of abuse there is sure
to be under any conceivable mode of pauper management, and what intense
vigilance is constantly required to keep it down. In all places where
people are detained in the power of others, and which they are either
not permitted or not able to quit whenever they please—in all prisons,
madhouses, hospitals, barracks, ships, schools, apprenticeships, and of
course therefore in all workhouses—if brutality, or dishonesty, or total
neglect of those who have no power of helping themselves, can exist
without detection and condign punishment, we ought to know that in a
very large proportion of cases they will exist. Though workhouses,
generally speaking, are less exposed to these evils than most of the
other places we have mentioned, because it is easier to get out of them,
we must not forget that every workhouse contains an hospital, that most
workhouses contain some sort of prison, or place of compulsory
confinement, for breaches of workhouse discipline, and that in
connection with every pauper system is a madhouse system. There is,
therefore, no kind of abuse, capable of existing in any of these
establishments, which may not exist, and that Edition: current; Page:
[925] in the utmost excess, in the management of the parish poor. The
case (in particular) of pauper lunatics, whether kept in the workhouse
itself or turned over to some private establishment, has claims on the
legislator’s care exceeding almost all others in strength. There cannot
be conceived any human creatures more utterly helpless. They can be
compared to nothing but the dumb animals whose treatment reflects such
disgrace on humanity. Like those, they cannot even tell of their wrongs;
they have no relations capable of giving them the smallest protection;
and those who have the care of them are—but the “nurse” Slater, the
other day, was a specimen of them.2 We may be sure, without being told,
that there is and always has been a greater amount of brutal
indifference, hardened want of feeling, and wanton and capricious
tyranny practised towards insane paupers, than towards any other class
of unfortunates whatever, in countries where personal slavery is not
permitted. The public are only beginning to know what these things are,
and that they are beginning, is due to the publicity which we owe to the
Poor-Law of 1834.

Governments will in time know enough of their business—they are awkward
journeymen as yet—to be able to struggle more effectually against these
and other evils. But whatever they do will not be done by weakening
central control, but by strengthening it. No one, whose real object is
to correct abuses, would seek to cripple the central authority, which is
the general court of appeal against whatever is locally wrong, which is
free from local interest or partiality, and which is under the
supervision and criticism of Parliament, and the whole public instead of
a mere locality. The Somerset-house Board3 is, and must always be, for
the purposes of its institution, too weak, because it cannot see or know
everything; but our wise men, it seems, were of opinion that it could
see and know too much, since they decided that some of its eyes and
hands—namely, its assistant-commissioners—could be dispensed with, and
left it with a number hardly sufficient, by indefatigable exertion, to
exercise a slight and perfunctory control over the local bodies under
its charge, whose connivance or negligence is the thing really in fault
in any flagrant instance of misconduct.4

But though the abuses are made a handle of, they are not the actuating
cause of the clamour against the Poor-law, which began long before it
had any capital of abuses to trade upon. The aim of the clamour is to
get rid, not of what is bad, but of what is good in the present
treatment of pauperism. It is a clamour against any Edition: current;
Page: [926] mode whatever of administering legal relief, which aims at
cultivating in the poor the virtue of independence; or, rather, against
any mode except one which cuts to the root of that virtue, wherever any
remnant of it exists. Viewed in this light, we regard the anti-poor-law
movement as one of the most melancholy features of this time; one of the
most serious obstacles to endeavours, rationally directed towards
effecting practical improvement in the minds or circumstances of the
labouring classes. There is no person, capable of understanding the
present state of the world, and estimating the probabilities respecting
its future, who does not see that this one virtue of independence is the
very foundation on which any chance of well-being and well-doing for the
labouring community must henceforth rest. There was a time when things
were, in a certain degree, otherwise. There was a time when the
labouring classes were willing to let their superiors in station think
and act for them: to receive thankfully, or at least submissively, such
relief for their necessities as those superiors thought adequate, and to
yield, in return for it, that general compliance with any rules laid
down for them, which must, by a necessity of Nature’s making, be
accorded by those who abdicate the care and responsibility of taking
charge of their own worldly circumstances. That time, however, is past;
and Lord John Manners is, we suppose, the only person who thinks that it
will ever more return.5 And, not to look beyond the incidents of the
moment, we have a small but instructive specimen, in the things now
transacting in Ireland, of what is to be expected from a people who have
attained to a press, and democratic associations, and monster meetings,
and who have not learnt that it is not other people’s business but their
own to take care that they have food and employment. Yet, because, we
suppose, the Irish of all classes have hitherto been too much addicted
to helping themselves, instead of calling on Hercules to help them, Mr.
Scrope and the Times are for making the Legislature bind itself to
provide work and food for every person born in Ireland, not only during
the present emergency but for ever. Others may expatiate on the
ruinousness of this project. We are not anxious on that score, since it
is too visionary, and its evils too pressing and imminent, to give the
smallest fear of its ever being carried into effect. What we lament, and
bitterly, is the diversion of a powerful section of the active force, so
much needed for overcoming the inert resistance to improvement, into a
channel in which it runs directly counter to the only course of
improvement henceforth possible. We grieve to see minds and
dispositions, capable of better things, wasting a great mass of
available power in a weak, hopeless, and really stale and superannuated
attempt to patch up society once more under the gone-by and now entirely
impracticable condition of a labouring people living, and contented to
live, in a state of dependence upon alms.

321.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [13]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 2 NOV., 1846, P. 4

Mill here discusses the Prize Essay, Addressed to the Agricultural
Committee of the Royal Dublin Society. On the Management of Landed
Property in Ireland (Dublin: Curry, 1834), by William Blacker
(1775-1855), Vice-Treasurer of Ireland 1817-29, who managed the estates
of Archibald Acheson (1776-1849), 2nd Earl of Gosford. For the context
of the series, see No. 306. This unheaded second leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A thirteenth leading article on Irish affairs in
the Morning Chronicle of 2d Novemb. 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 62).

common sense seldom proves to be altogether new. A practical suggestion,
really called for by the time, and adapted to it, is generally found to
have been made repeatedly before, and not attended to. It has been
pointed out to us that the plan we advocate for the location of the
peasantry of Ireland on the waste lands, for which we have already
acknowledged our obligation to Mr. William Thornton,1 was propounded as
early as 1834, and what is more surprising, in a prize essay to which
the Dublin Society awarded their gold medal.2 The author of the essay is
a high authority on Irish agriculture, Mr. Blacker, of Armagh, the
well-known manager of Lord Gosford’s and other estates in the north of
Ireland; one of those meritorious persons who have shown by example in
what manner Irish resources and the Irish people can be improved, if
those set over them take pains and have patience, and possess the
qualities which inspire confidence. The attempt, indeed, has seldom
failed in the hands of landlords or agents who knew the proper means of
influencing a most docile and flexible people, and who were not too
selfishly grasping or too selfishly idle to practice them. But this
category comprises so few persons, that in spite of the brilliant
success, both philanthropic and pecuniary, which has rewarded those few,
Ireland, as a country, still remains what we see it.

Mr. Blacker’s essay is full of valuable suggestions, drawn from his
ample experience, for the better management of the lands already under
cultivation. Of these we may make use hereafter, as occasion offers, but
for the present we are concerned only with such of his propositions as
relate to the waste lands.

Mr. Blacker proposes

that the State should assume the right of taking to itself those tracts
of reclaimable land which the owners continue to let remain
uncultivated, and after giving fair compensation, should make a
practical experiment whether they could not be colonized to advantage.
Let Edition: current; Page: [928] the experiment, of course, be first
made where the greatest chance of success exists, that is, where fuel
and limestone are to be had, and drainage most practicable, [or] where
extensive and reclaimable morasses are owned by such a number of
proprietors as to make any joint effort at reclaiming the least likely
to take place. In this respect the valuable reports of the Bog
Commissioners, made some years back, and the present Ordnance survey,
would give ample information.3 Take, for example, the Bog of Allen,
where there are, I believe, thousands of acres, capable of drainage, to
which no individual right can be proved. Suppose Government to undertake
the drainage of this, and to purchase, by a valuation, such parts as any
property could be proved in. Let the work be then undertaken at the
public expense, under the direction of experienced engineers, and let
the workmen be stimulated to exertion by having an allotment of ten to
twenty acres in perpetuity proposed to them as the reward of good
conduct. Their own numbers would afford mutual protection, and as soon
as the drainage was completed, let their lot be marked out, and they
turned over from the engineer to the agriculturist.

[Pp. 33-4.]

Concerning the most advantageous mode of affording public aid to these
settlers, Mr. Blacker’s opinions, being founded on personal knowledge,
are more enlightened, and more suitable to the peculiarities of the
case, than those of Mr. Poulett Scrope.

Government, [he says,] should not advance one farthing, except for such
objects as supplied the means of industry, as lime, seeds, &c., and some
assistance to roof their huts. Let every comfort be the fruit of their
own industry, to raise which to the utmost pitch of exertion nothing
more would be necessary than to hold out the prospect of a perpetuity,
as above-mentioned.

Suppose a settler to have earned, by previous labour under the engineer,
the small sum that would support him whilst he would be engaged in
setting his potatoes upon his new lot, and having done so, that he
should then return to his work until his crop was ripe, and that in his
extra hours he should, during the summer, put up a small cabin, which
his earnings might, perhaps, enable him to do, or with the assistance of
40s. or 50s. advanced to him; he would then be perfectly fit to proceed
in reclaiming, and with much less hardship and suffering than attends an
emigrant on his first settlement in America, which would cost as much
for one family as would put thirty here in the way of becoming
independent.

[Pp. 34-6.]

This great improver, and most competent judge of the motives which sway
the Irish farmer, bears important testimony to the practical efficacy of
that greatest of boons, a permanent interest in the soil:

It is the charm contained in the word perpetuity which induces such
numbers of individuals, who have been accustomed to many of the comforts
of life, to emigrate to America, and there undergo hardships far beyond
what any settler would experience at home. . . . I have supposed the
settler a mere pauper; but the idea of obtaining a perpetuity, without
incurring any ill will, or being exposed to any insecurity, would bring
settlers from all parts of the kingdom, having capital to build houses
and reclaim the lands Edition: current; Page: [929] without any
assistance whatever. In fact, I am fully persuaded, that if Government
confined themselves merely to the purchasing all land that was allowed
to lie waste by the owners, and having brought it into a state fit for
cultivation, by draining, would then let it in perpetuity, in small
farms, at a remunerating rent, there would be applicants enough to
occupy any land that might in this way be brought into the market, and
with capital sufficient for its cultivation.

[Pp. 35-7.]

This deep sense of “the charm contained in the word perpetuity,” has the
greater evidentiary value when coming from Mr. Blacker, as it cannot in
his case be ascribed to any preconceived theory; for his attention does
not seem to have been drawn to the vast utility of a peasant
proprietary, either as a feature in the social condition of a country
generally, or as a means of reforming and elevating the habits of Irish
peasants. His plan is proposed on grounds merely economical, as one
which would increase the produce of the country and the employment for
labour, and at the same time yield a large profit to the Government.
Accordingly, it is no part of his proposal that the rent should be
limited to simple interest on the advances made by the State. For the
first seven years he would so limit it, estimating the interest,
however, at the high rate of five per cent.; but at the end of that time
he would grant the land in perpetuity, at more than one half of its full
value—that is, he would add to the five per cent. interest, half the
difference between that interest and a full rent. [P. 35.] We would most
gladly accept this plan, had we no hope of any better; it would secure
to the cultivator the inestimable benefit of a property in the soil,
subject to a fixed burthen, which would still be only equivalent to a
moderate land-tax. All the effects of such a plan would be good, but
they would not be sufficiently large, nor, above all, sufficiently
rapid. The homoeopathic system will not do for acting on the masses; you
cannot cure the moral maladies of a whole labouring people by
infinitesimal remedies. We want something which will stir the minds of
the peasantry from one end of Ireland to the other, and cause a rush of
all the active spirits to take advantage of the boon for the first time
proffered to them. We want something which may be regarded as a great
act of national justice—healing the wounds of centuries by giving, not
selling, to the worthiest and most aspiring sons of the soil, the unused
portion of the inheritance of their conquered ancestors. We want,
especially, something which cannot be understood or represented as a
mere pecuniary speculation for the profit of the revenue. We want
England to have the credit of doing something in love to Ireland, or in
duty to her, and not that of making her very beneficence subservient to
extracting more gain from a soil, her title to which, until confirmed by
the lapse of ages, was no other than that of usurpation and conquest.
We, therefore, wish the new proprietary to have the benefit of whatever
the State can do for them at the price it costs to the State. And in
testimony to the moral effect which may be expected, we need only quote
one short passage more from Mr. Blacker:

I maintain that there is, generally speaking, no want of industry, if
you let the Edition: current; Page: [930] advantage of exertion be
clearly seen, of which I have had repeated proofs. . . . The spirit of
industry which will arise with the first appearance of being put in the
way of bettering their situation, will be sufficient to astonish any
person who has not had experience of what such a change of measures will
produce. In this respect I can speak from personal knowledge.

[P. 7.]

And of personal knowledge few Irishmen have more than Mr. Blacker, or
have used it to better purpose.


322.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [14]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 3 NOV., 1846, P. 4

In this article Mill continues the defence of Senior’s Edinburgh Review
article against Poulett Scrope and The Times (see No. 320). For the
context of the series, see No. 306. This unheaded first leader is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “A fourteenth leading article on
Irish affairs in the Morning Chronicle of 3d Nov. 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 62).

it has been thought extremely ridiculous by the Times, that an article
on Irish poor-laws, written in August last, should be published in
October, without any allusion whatever to the intervening exigency
occasioned by the potato famine. The reproach falls but lightly upon the
Edinburgh reviewer. A poor-law is not a thing for a temporary exigency,
and one does not see how any temporary exigency can affect the
discussion of it; it must stand or fall by its merits as a permanent
institution. A failure of the potato crop cannot make that a good law
which would otherwise be a bad one. But the sarcasm of the Times falls
back, with crushing effect, upon itself. It is the Times which, writing
in the very centre and heart of the exigency, takes no account of it,
proposes nothing for it, has evidently nothing to propose. Assume the
Times to be right on the subject of a poor-law for Ireland;1 assume that
a legal compulsion upon the parish, that is to say upon the landlords,
to find food and work for all the necessitous able-bodied, would be a
good and wholesome settlement of Irish economics; still, that will not
feed the people for the next six months. It is impossible to get the
machinery of an extended poor-law into play in less than that time. And
no reasonable person can suppose that the resources of the Irish
landlords are sufficient, tax them ever so heavily, to effect all that
is necessary for shielding the Irish population from hunger until next
year’s crops come in. On all suppositions, therefore, something must be
done for Ireland, which the most lavish system of poor-law
administration cannot do. What shall this be? We look in vain to the
Times for a reply. We know its permanent plan, but we are yet to learn
its temporary expedient. This is very inconvenient, because the
questions connected with the Edition: current; Page: [931] temporary
expedient are of much greater importance just now than the permanent
plan; so much so, that we might be content to leave all permanent
questions for the present in abeyance, except the question how much
permanent good it may be practicable to accomplish by a proper choice of
remedies for the temporary necessity. There is urgent need of a large
immediate expenditure, which can be drawn in the first instance from no
other source than the Imperial treasury. This expenditure may take place
in many ways, in some of which it would do no permanent good, in others
a great deal. Is it of no consequence which? This great Government
expenditure is a great power. It is the power of prescribing, for the
time being, a great part of the industry of the country. Into what
channel shall we turn that industry? More remotely, it gives the power
of altering, to a very important extent, the industrial relation of the
different classes of Irish people. That relation is thought by most
persons to be at a considerable distance at present from abstract
perfection. No one is exactly satisfied with the present laws of
distribution of Irish wealth between the cottier tenants and their
landlords. Can any use be made of the present opportunity for improving
these things, and in what manner? We have a right to expect answers to
these questions from a professed general adviser of the public.

And they are questions on which it is not impossible that reasonable
persons might agree, who may be altogether at issue in their opinions
with regard to ulterior measures. Let the poor-law of Elizabeth be
suited to the circumstances of Ireland or not, that is no reason why
Irish labour should not be guided to the improvement and extension of
Irish agriculture. Let it be proper or not that the landlords should
find work for all who are without it, that is no reason against placing
as many as possible of the peasantry in a condition not to need any work
but what they can provide for themselves. If Ireland is to have out-door
paupers, that is no reason why she should not also have peasant
proprietors; nor is it easy to see why a prodigal poor-law, if it be
desirable, should either be less likely to be obtained, or less likely,
when obtained, to prove satisfactory, in case we first put a large
section of the peasantry beyond the necessity of depending on it, and
set up an object of honest ambition in full view of all the rest, which
may balance the corrupting influence of such a poor-law upon their
minds. It should seem, on the contrary, that the more profuse the
administration of relief, the greater the necessity for these
countervailing influences. And these are all topics for the day,
questions which must be resolved at once, or the opportunity of action
will be lost. The poor-law question, on the contrary, is just as fit to
be discussed a twelvemonth hence, when the potatoes are again abundant
or altogether abolished.

Let the Times keep its opinion on poor-laws, both for Ireland and
England. But we implore it to believe that something besides a poor-law
is necessary to put the labourers of either country in the condition in
which they ought to be. Anybody may have a fixed idea, on which he is
inaccessible to reason, but it does not Edition: current; Page: [932]
follow that he is never to add a second idea to it. When our
contemporary happens to be in the right—when he chances to seize that
view of a question which is at once true and available for practice, he
usually does it with so much effect, that it is real injustice to
himself wilfully to narrow his range of eyesight, and resolve to shut
out every part of a great subject but that on which he has predetermined
to be thoroughly unreasonable.


323.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [15]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 5 NOV., 1846, P. 4

For the context, see No. 306. This unheaded first leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A fifteenth leading article on Irish affairs in
the Morning Chronicle of 5th Novemb. 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 62).

the resolution of ministers not to call Parliament together before the
accustomed period, taken in conjunction with the provisional measures
already adopted in Ireland, either under the acts of the last session,
or under the discretionary authority assumed by Lord Besborough,
constitutes a new complication, of rather a serious kind, in the already
formidable entanglement of Irish affairs.1

It is now certain that before the Legislature can interfere, before any
comprehensive plan of dealing with Irish difficulties can be even
proposed to Parliament, a large amount of public money will have been
already expended. The best which will have been done with any part of
this money is to drain and otherwise improve land for the benefit of the
landlords: the worst, to squander it in jobs, or in useless or
superfluous “public works.” The immediate purpose, of giving wages, and
what is called employment, to a proportion of the distressed population,
will have been answered in either case; and, in the first case, the
foundation will have been laid for an increase of the produce of the
soil in future years. There will be next year a rather larger surface of
potato ground (or corn ground, if the potato becomes unavailable), and
an additional number of cottier tenants upon it. Some who have
heretofore contented themselves with conacre, will next year be
cottiers; and some who had come annually to England for harvest work,
will discontinue, as they have done even this summer, their periodical
migration, and settle down as cottiers on the new soil. Thus will it be
Edition: current; Page: [933] if there is an increased area of
cultivated surface; but it appears more probable that drainage by public
money will be confined to lands already under culture, and will not
increase the quantity, but only the productiveness, of the available
soil; so that the competition for land remaining in unabated intensity,
no one will gain but the landlord. He alone will reap, in the form of
increased rent, the undivided benefit of what is added to the produce of
the country by this great national expenditure; except indeed such
interest on the outlay as the State thinks fit to reserve.

Money thus laid out is wasted, in respect of any good to the people,
except the indispensable first object of keeping them from starving. But
we are not going to repeat the arguments by which we have striven to
impress, upon all whom it may concern, the folly and culpability of
wasting invaluable opportunity, and effecting the relief of an immediate
necessity by the most useless and worthless, when it might as easily be
effected by the most transcendently beneficial means. We need not now
recur to these considerations. The progress of events has given us more
pressing arguments, and a case still stronger than we looked for. We
knew that to feed the peasantry even temporarily by Government wages,
with no ultimate object before us—with nothing in progress or in
prospect for rendering their condition more hopeful, for increasing the
motives to industry, peace, and providence, and the restraints on the
opposite vices—would be doing nothing for them beyond the moment; that
it would leave them in as bad a state as it found them. Events already
show that it will leave them much worse. What little industry, what
little self-reliance, what little respect for law and the rights of
others did exist in Ireland, notwithstanding all that the institutions
of society had done for ages to render them impossible, are breaking
down before even the limited and uncertain expectation of “relief to the
able-bodied,” which the present arrangements hold out. Because
Government employs some, it is expected to employ all. Nobody will
offer, and nobody will take any work but Government work. The entire
maintenance of the population is attempted to be thrown upon the
Government. To have done anything for them is only a title to the more
virulent abuse for not doing everything which they choose to think
possible, or to demand without considering if it be possible or not.

It is certain, in short, that unless this temporary crisis and its
relief are made means of permanent improvement in the habits and
feelings, as well as in the economical condition of the people, they
will be a cause of permanent deterioration. England will have managed to
do what seemed hardly possible—to make the “difficulties” of Ireland
greater than they were before. She will have to deal with a more
ungovernable people than ever—as full as before of reasonable
discontent, but now full also of unreasonable hopes and demands—as
little inclined as ever to put their own shoulders to the wheel, but now
persuaded that they ought to be, and that they can be, pensioners of the
English treasury, and that nothing but the wickedness, the tyranny, the
Edition: current; Page: [934] selfishness of their English rulers
prevents it. Not with impunity will the English Government have indulged
the Irish multitude with the first full, plentiful taste of public pay.
The peasants have found out soon enough that public wages are better
than private wages, and the work always less; and they will not forget
the lesson.

Not only then in order to change bad into good, but to prevent bad from
growing into worse, it is the duty of all rulers and persons in
authority to consider at this crisis, with all the vigour which they are
masters of, what resources the nature of man, and the circumstances of
Ireland afford for giving permanent employment to the people in such a
way as shall make them rely on themselves, instead of relying on the
Government, and work out their destiny by labour and prudence, instead
of waiting idly or clamouring turbulently to be fed. There is but one
sure way, but one remedy, whose efficacy is as sovereign as the present
disease is extreme. Let their labour and prudence be for themselves. Let
them work and save to better their own condition, not to enrich others.
Let them have a permanent interest in the soil.

But time presses; the mischief now taking place in Ireland is
progressive, and the funds requisite for the relief of present distress
are all this while being squandered with no permanent fruit. Even under
the “vigour beyond the law” exercised by Lord Besborough, the drainage
of lands can only take place by arrangement with the landlords; and to
undertake the compulsory purchase of waste lands, and commence
arrangements for locating the peasantry on them, upon the responsibility
of Government, in anticipation of the sanction of Parliament, exceeds
the amount of discretionary power which the Executive would, or perhaps
could, think itself warranted in assuming. Is the case then without
possible remedy for months to come? Can nothing be done with existing
means, and within the terms of the Lord-Lieutenant’s proclamation?2 Let
us see.

The advances from the public, contemplated by the Lord-Lieutenant, are a
gratuitous boon to the landlords. To this boon no one supposes that the
landlords, as such, have any claim. They give no equivalent for it. They
have in no way either earned or deserved it. The Government,
accordingly, does not give it to them for their own sake. It intends
them as the mere channels through which a benefit is to reach a portion
of the community far other than themselves. That the permanent fruits of
improvements made by public money accrue to them, and them alone, in the
form of increased rent, is an incidental circumstance, arising from the
unfortunate state of landed tenancies in Ireland, but in itself not a
thing intended nor desired by the Government. Well then, to this
unmerited and unintended gift let the Government annex a condition. Let
it make a rule that no landlord shall receive its aid in improving his
land, except on condition of giving to the tenants of the land so
improved a permanent proprietary interest in the Edition: current; Page:
[935] soil. The condition would not be onerous. The land would be given
back to the landlord greatly increased in value. Let him rest content
with that increase, and bind himself for ever that there at least his
demands shall stop. Let him grant to every tenant a perpetual lease, on
a fair valuation of the land after the Government has drained it. We
should greatly prefer an arrangement much more liberal than this. We
would require him to divide with the tenant the boon conferred on
himself, and to grant a perpetual tenure at a rent much below the full
value of the improved land. But we should hail with joy even the more
niggardly arrangement; and so, we venture to say, would the tenantry.
The immediate gain to the landlord would be a manifold equivalent for
renouncing any further prospective increase. Besides, the arrangement
would be voluntary. If he prefers the shadow to the substance, nobody
seeks to interfere with him; let him shift for himself; only do not
present him with the substance too.

We propose this plan as the supplement and completion of that which we
have already advocated with respect to the waste lands. We propose it as
a means, the readiest means, by which the admirable social and
economical effects of a property in the soil may be extended directly to
a wider circle of the population than those who may become settlers on
the waste. We propose it also as susceptible of immediate application.
The Lord-Lieutenant has only to will it. He is not pledged to improve
the lands of everybody who asks for it; he has reserved to himself a
full discretion. He has only to name his conditions. What they should be
is to us very clear. If any one has anything better to propose, let him
state it, and let the intelligence of the two countries be our judge.

 MORNING CHRONICLE, 6 NOV., 1846, P. 4

For the context, see No. 306. This unheaded first leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A sixteenth leading article on Irish affairs, in

(MacMinn, p. 62).

we cannot think that the mode of affording relief and employment to the
distressed Irish, which has sprung up, if we may so speak, under the
Lord-Lieutenant’s proclamation,1 would have been adopted by any
Government deliberately and with forethought. Having a people to feed,
and the choice what to do with their labour in return, we do not think
that any Government would have selected by preference to make them work
for the sole gain of a few individual landowners. That was not, in fact,
the original intention. It never was contemplated or foreseen by
Parliament. What Parliament and the Government Edition: current; Page:
[936] itself intended was something totally different. The public was to
pay and feed the people, and to the public their services were to be
given. They were to be employed on “public works.”2 Unhappily, public
works were understood in too limited a sense. Roads and bridges are not
wanted in indefinite quantity, and in some states of the industry and
trade of a neighbourhood are hardly wanted at all. Every one, therefore,
applauded when it was found that the money voted by Parliament was not
to be all expended in these useless or premature undertakings. Draining
the land, to make it yield better crops, was at least something useful.
The works for which the baronies made such large presentment were either
useful in a much less degree, or altogether superfluous. Every one saw
with pleasure that when a large sum of money was to be spent, and a
large amount of labour to be employed, the Irish Government took
whatever of responsibility was involved in deciding that the labour
should be productive, and that the money should be so spent as to be of
permanent use to somebody.

So far well, and we have no desire to qualify the praise bestowed on
Ministers for this amendment in the provisions hastily made, at the end
of a fatiguing session and the beginning of a Ministry, by the
Legislature. But it is no disparagement to say that the measure thus
adopted on the spur of the moment, in order to substitute something for
a set of arrangements whose failure had taken Ministers and the country
by surprise, bears on it unmistakeable marks of the peculiarity of its
origin. Not this measure, or any like it, we feel assured, would have
been proposed to Parliament, with time for consideration, and in the
calmness of deliberate legislation. If it had been foreseen six months
ago that drainage and other improvement of land, whether waste or
cultivated, was the best purpose, and would, in fact, be the purpose to
which the apparatus created for the employment of Irish labour would be
turned, most assuredly it would only have been sanctioned after some
previous consideration of who was the right person to profit by it, and
why. We are surely not giving too much credit to Ministers and
Parliament when we assume that they would in that case have seen fit to
maintain the integrity of the principle, that when public money is
expended it is the public that should reap the benefit. The improvement
of land is as fit to be a public work as anything else; in Ireland,
fitter than most things else. But then, it must be improvement for the
public. We do think that if the subject had been dealt with in the way
of regular legislation this would have been seen. We do think that it
would have seemed to everybody, except Irish landlords, a thing at once
ridiculous and intolerable that the Treasury should set up in business
as a drainer and improver of landed estates, for the profit of their
proprietors. We cannot believe but that this must be the real opinion of
Ministers themselves, and that if they seem to countenance such a
scheme, it can only be temporarily, and Edition: current; Page: [937]
because nothing more rational occurred to them as capable of being done
at the moment.

But the consideration which could not be given at the moment may be
given now. If the measures of the Irish Government are successful, if
the labour they are ready to feed and pay is judiciously directed and
vigilantly superintended, the result will be a large, perhaps a very
large, permanent accession to the produce and wealth of the country. We
will assume that this prospect is realised, that the inefficiency and
jobbery which have been the curse of all public undertakings in Ireland,
will not prevent this great addition from being made to the aggregate
riches of the country. And now comes the time to enquire whether it is
by any inherent necessity, any indefeasible law of nature, that this
creation of wealth, by the public counsels and the public means, must
all be made away with by the landlords. For theirs, and theirs only,
will it be, to the last penny, on the present system of unrestrained
competition for land. The extra food produced on the improved land,
after reserving to the cottiers their potato diet or its equivalent,
will continue, as at present, to be exported to feed England, and the
price to be paid away in rent. Now, must this be so? Is the cause in the
nature of things, or only in human stupidity? Has political wisdom no
means of obviating such a result? Does it need a miracle to make so
curious a thing come to pass as that the public should reap where the
public only has sown?

Such are the questions to which answers must be found by Lord John
Russell; and we cannot think that there needs be a moment’s hesitation
what those answers must be. It would be an actual crime to bestow all
this wealth upon the landlords, without exacting an equivalent. The
equivalent may be of two kinds; we do not see that any third kind is
possible. The State may demand, from those whose land it improves, a
money payment to itself, or it may stipulate for advantages of some sort
to the occupiers and cultivators of the soil. As for profit to itself,
beyond a fair interest for its expenses, the thing ought not to be
thought of; though, compared with giving all to the landlord, even that
would be wisdom. The remaining plan is, to make advantageous conditions
for the tenants. And what can those conditions be, except a limitation
of rent? But a limitation of rent, if made binding on the landlord, is
another word for perpetuity of tenure. It implies that so long as the
tenant pays the fixed rent he cannot be ejected. If he does not pay it,
of course the landlord ought to have the power of ejecting him, or
rather of compelling him to sell, as indeed ought any other creditor.

The means of carrying this plan immediately into practice are simple and
obvious; it would even save much responsibility, and a rather invidious
office, to the Government or its subordinates, in selecting the fittest
recipients of the pecuniary subsidy offered by the State for the
improvement of lands. Let the preference be given to those landowners
who will grant, in return, the most favourable terms of perpetual tenure
to the farmers. There would be some difficulties in carrying out this
principle in complete detail, from the necessity of Edition: current;
Page: [938] sometimes including lands belonging to many proprietors in a
single extensive draining operation. But these difficulties might be
met; the owners of two-thirds, or some other preponderant proportion of
the lands of a district, might have power to bind the remainder; or, if
this were thought objectionable, the Government might make its
arrangements for the whole, whenever satisfied with the terms offered by
the majority; and the recusant minority, who would obtain their share of
the benefit, might be made to pay the full value for it. These are small
impediments, easily removed by minds thoroughly in earnest about the
principle. It is rare, indeed, that any great work is to be achieved in
which the difficulties are so few. There is nothing to daunt, and
everything to encourage, a minister who once clearly sees that the thing
proposed is desirable; and on him who does not will devolve, and
immediately too, what he will find the far more onerous duty of
contriving and proposing something better.


325.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [17]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 9 NOV., 1846, P. 4

For the context, see No. 306. This unheaded first leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A seventeenth leading article on Irish affairs,
in the Morning Chronicle of 9th Nov. 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 63).

the report of the commission of inquiry into the condition of the Irish
poor, presided over by Archbishop Whately in 1836,1 recommended an
interference with landed property, for the purpose of improvement, quite
as large and decided as that which we suggested in last Friday’s
Chronicle.2

The recommendation was supported by what is always extremely potent with
the English public, an English precedent. “Having,” said the
commissioners, “improvements in the lands of Ireland immediately in
contemplation, it appears to us that the laws which form the
constitution of the Bedford Level Corporation in England afford
principles of legislation directly suited to our purpose. They enforce
improvements in property at the expense of the property improved.”3
Accordingly the commissioners advised that a board should be appointed
for Ireland, with powers similar to those of the Bedford Level
Corporation, that is, among other things, with compulsory powers of
drainage and other improvements. From the nature of the tract of low
fenny country called the Bedford Edition: current; Page: [939] Level, it
was impossible to drain any part of it except by an operation including
the whole, and it would have been the extreme of injustice, if
wrong-headed or miserly owners of a portion of the district had either
been allowed to frustrate by their opposition a plan required by the
wishes and interests of the remainder, or to escape from their share of
the expense of a measure by which, in common with the others, they were
to profit. We go further, and say that if not a minority of the
proprietors, but every individual proprietor of the level had refused
his assent to the proposition, if it had been simply a measure of public
good, a great national improvement, which these persons had attempted to
defeat by withholding their co-operation, it would have been equally the
duty of the Legislature to persevere. Rights of property are conferred
to promote the public good, not that they may be used as obstacles to
it.

The Commissioners proposed that the “Board of Improvement,” which they
desired to constitute, should be authorized, from time to time, “to make
a survey, valuation, and partition of any waste lands in Ireland.”4 And
though the idea does not seem to have occurred to them of making those
lands instrumental to effecting a beneficial change in the present
pernicious system of Irish tenancy, it is worth while to adduce their
evidence to the great benefit which might be expected, in a merely
agricultural point of view, from the extension of industry over this
hitherto neglected source of food and employment. “Upon these lands [Mr.
Arthur Young observed nearly sixty years ago] is to be practised the
most profitable husbandry in the King’s dominions. The Commissioners
appointed to inquire into the state of the bogs of Ireland, in 1809,
reported to the like effect; and committee after committee of the House
of Commons have done the same thing.”5 From the report of one of these
committees, that of 1830, the Commissioners make extracts, of which the
following are a part:

There are three millions of Irish acres of waste land, equal to five
millions of English acres, which are considered to be almost all
reclaimable. . . . It is in evidence that, by an expense of somewhat
about £7 an acre, land in the county of Sligo has been reclaimed, and
rendered worth a rent of 30s.; or, if preserved in the hands of the
proprietor, that it is made capable of repaying all expenses by three
years’ produce, leaving all subsequent returns clear gain.6

General Bourke “states that he is proprietor of bogs in different
places, and has Edition: current; Page: [940] tried the experiment of
improving them; that bog on which turf has been cut, and which was in a
wild and uncultivated state, had been, at an expense of £7 an acre,
raised from 10s. to the value of 30s. acreable rent.”7 All this, without
the aid of those great scientific operations by which large tracts of
country are drained at once, and which (at all times the most economical
mode of accomplishing the object) might be considered at the present
time to cost nothing, since the sums they would cost are at any rate to
be expended, if only for the immediate relief of the people.

The report last cited contains a passage from which it might almost be
inferred, that a glimmering of the desirableness of giving to the
occupiers of the soil some greater hold upon it than that of cottiers or
conacre-men, had dawned upon a committee of the House of Commons as
early as 1830. “If this work,” said the committee,

can be accomplished, not only would it afford a transitory but a
permanent demand for productive labour, accompanied by a corresponding
rise of wages and improvement in the condition of the poor;
opportunities would also be afforded for the settlement of the
peasantry, now super-abundant in particular districts, on waste lands
which at present scarcely produce the means of sustenance, or are suited
for human habitations. This change would be alike advantageous to the
lands from whence the settlers are taken, and to those on which they may
hereafter be fixed, and may facilitate the means of introducing a
comfortable yeomanry and an improved agriculture in the more fertile
districts. The severe pressure of the system of clearing farms and
ejecting subtenants may thus be mitigated, and the general state of the
peasantry improved.8

A yeomanry! That was the ancient English appellation for a peasant
proprietary, or at least for farmers who held their land on fixed
conditions, and by custom (if not by law) could not be dispossessed so
long as those conditions were fulfilled. What the committee meant by a
yeomanry we do not exactly understand; but we cannot imagine that they
could mean cottier tenants. There is much in a name. The term peasant
proprietor, or small landed proprietor, suggests no associations to most
Englishmen. It speaks to them of something which they do not know from
experience, which they have not even heard much about, and which may be
good or bad for the countries that have it, but which at any rate is not
English. But England is wont to boast of her yeomanry; to regard them as
one of her points of historical pre-eminence over the nations of the
continent; and even, by some unaccountable illusion, to flatter herself
that she still possesses them. The yeomanry of England, as a general
feature of English life, were ruined and blotted out of the country
early in the Tudor period, in a manner very clearly narrated by Mr.
Thornton;9 and England has since passed Edition: current; Page: [941]
into an agricultural system altogether different, though never hitherto
equally favourable to the physical comfort, not to mention the
independence and dignity, of the cultivators of the soil.

But there is a corner of England which still possesses a yeomanry in the
antique sense; peasant farmers who own the land they till, paying
nothing for it except some customary dues to the lord of the manor. They
occupy a considerable portion of Westmoreland and Cumberland, and are
known by the local name of Estatesmen, or Statesmen. Those who knew not
of this class have often wondered where—among the care-worn,
down-trampled agricultural labourers of England—Wordsworth found the
originals of the peasantry delineated in his poems. Those acquainted
with the counties bear testimony to the fidelity of the likeness. The
same celebrated poet, in his little descriptive work on the scenery of
the lakes, describes the state of society which existed for centuries in
the upper part of the dales as

a perfect republic of shepherds and agriculturists, proprietors, for the
most part, of the lands which they occupied and cultivated. . . . Among
whom the plough of each man was confined to the maintenance of his own
family, or to the occasional accommodation of his neighbour. Two or
three cows furnished each family with milk and cheese. The chapel was
the only edifice that presided over these dwellings, the supreme head of
this pure commonwealth; the members of which existed in the midst of a
powerful empire, like an ideal society, or an organized community, whose
constitution had been imposed and regulated by the mountains which
protected it. Neither high-born nobleman, knight, nor esquire was here;
but many of these humble sons of the hills had a consciousness that the
land which they walked over and tilled had for more than five hundred
years been possessed by men of their name and blood. . . . Corn was
grown in these vales sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for
each family, no more. The storms and moisture of the climate induced
them to sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone,
as places of shelter for their sheep, where, in tempestuous weather,
food was distributed to them. Every family spun from its own flock the
wool with which it was clothed; a weaver was here and there found among
them, and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the
yarn, which they carded and spun in their own houses, and carried to
market either under their arms, or more frequently on pack-horses, a
small train taking their way weekly down the valley, or over the
mountains, to the most commodious town.10

Notwithstanding the changes in the economy of modern society, from the
progress of commerce and manufactures, the more migratory habits
produced by improved modes of communication, and especially the
encroachments of the great landholders, who have long seized every
opportunity which accidentally offered of enlarging their domains by
buying up the little estates, a considerable number of these happy and
independent peasant-proprietors still exists; and if an Edition:
current; Page: [942] example is wanted of the admirable results of a
state of agricultural economy in which the occupation of land and the
property of it are vested in the same hands, all that we have seen,
heard, or read of these people unites to assure us that the Statesmen of
the Cumberland valleys are such an example.


326.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [18]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 11 NOV., 1846, P. 4

This article continues the controversy over Scrope’s proposals for a
poor law for Ireland. Scrope replied to Mill’s article of 3 Nov. (No.
322) in a letter to the editor headed “Poor Laws in Ireland,” Morning
Chronicle, 9 Nov., p. 6, from which Mill’s quotations here are taken.
For the context, see No. 306. This unheaded first leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “An eighteenth leading article on Irish affairs,
in the Morning Chronicle of 11th Nov. 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 63).

our paper of monday contained a temperate and courteous letter from Mr.
Poulett Scrope, expostulating with us upon our conscientious opposition
to the scheme in which he puts his chief trust for the improvement of
Ireland—the extension to her of what he now terms “the English”
Poor-law. We wish to do all justice to Mr. Scrope. Ireland is really
indebted to him, not only for the zeal with which he has urged her
general claims upon the active good offices of England for removing a
state of social and economical evil which it is a disgrace to tolerate,
but also for his having identified himself with a measure of greater
remedial efficacy, both economical and moral, than any other thing
capable of such easy accomplishment—the apportionment of the enormous
extent of waste land among peasant proprietors. On this topic we have
rendered the deserved honour to Mr. Scrope. We have acknowledged that
his advocacy of that important measure preceded ours;1 and we are not
aware of having given ground for the complaint which he mildly prefers
against us, of eulogising Mr. Blacker and Mr. Thornton at his expense,
on points in which their plans were completely identical with his own.
To the identity of the main features we have always willingly borne
testimony:2 the preference we gave to Mr. Blacker had relation only to a
matter of detail (not, however, unimportant in principle), on which we
had previously commented as the vulnerable point in Mr. Scrope’s
practical arrangements. His scheme provides that the State should build
cottages for those whom it locates on the lands: Mr. Blacker, more
wisely in our opinion, recommends that the State should limit its
assistance to the means and appliances3 of cultivation, leaving whatever
directly concerns the labourer’s comforts to the labourer’s own care.

Edition: current; Page: [943]
To come, however, to the principal topic of the letter. Mr. Scrope
regards the bestowing of the waste lands upon the peasantry not so much
in the light of a great measure of national relief in itself, either by
its direct operation, or by the gradual influence on the minds of the
peasantry of the social state which would arise from it; but rather as a
“necessary and most appropriate auxiliary and supplement to our improved
poor-law.” He blames us for advocating the one measure only, instead of
two schemes, which, “far from there being any necessary antagonism
between” them, “are suited admirably to aid and advance one another;”
and he calls upon us to abandon what he terms “a vain and ungenerous
struggle to protract the denial to the Irish poor of a legislative
provision in the extremity of want.”

We must pause for a moment to notice the flagrant injustice of this
appeal ad invidiam, whether as affecting ourselves or the Legislature.
The Irish have “a legislative provision in the extremity of want.” They
have already a Poor Law, which, if it does not recognise the absolute
right to relief that exists in England, undertakes however to make
provision for “the extremity of want” in all ordinary cases, and the
State, as we see in extraordinary cases, comes forward with
supplementary resources pro hâc vice.4 Neither, if the Irish pauper
system were ever so defective, would it be any argument against us. We
offer them better than a pauper system. We propose to them something
preferable to parish pay. Instead of an allowance, we give them land;
instead of working for the parish, we set them to work for themselves.
It is as plain as figures can make it, that land can be found for more
than the whole surplus population, and it is as certain as testimony can
make it, that this land is of as good a quality as much of that already
under tillage. We do not promise to give land to everybody; but neither,
we suppose, are poor rates promised to everybody. We undertake to
establish in the honourable and independent position of proprietors of
the soil so large a portion of the peasantry, that the remainder shall
neither be in need of land nor of poor rate, but shall find steady
employment at ample wages on the estates of the present landholders.
Upon us therefore, at least, Mr. Scrope’s imputations fall innocuous.

In attempting to show that the waste-lands plan and the poor-law plan
are calculated to smooth the way for one another, Mr. Scrope, as it
appears to us, succeeds in one-half of what he undertakes. He shows,
what scarcely needed showing, that the success of the waste-lands plan
“would remove many of the most formidable difficulties in the way of an
extended poor-law.” Of course his poor-law would not be so immediately
or so certainly fatal if the present vast superfluity of those who would
be claimants on its bounties were drafted off before it arrived. If
anything could give the Irish a chance of bearing unharmed the effects
of a pauperizing poor-law, it would be to thoroughly dispauperize
Edition: current; Page: [944] them first. We may therefore fairly call
upon Mr. Scrope, in the name of his own argument, to put his poor-law in
abeyance until this preliminary measure is carried. Without the
preliminary measure the poor-law, as he seems to admit, would never
answer; while the preliminary measure, pushed with sufficient vigour,
might possibly suffice as a final measure, and leave no blameless
destitution for a poor-law to relieve.

But while the waste-lands location would either supersede the proposed
poor-law by doing far more than what a poor-law is designed to do, or,
if it failed in this, would, on Mr. Scrope’s own showing, make the field
clearer both for obtaining a more extensive poor-law and for its
success; he altogether fails to show that by enacting the poor-law we
should at all facilitate the other measure. How should we? Will it
perhaps be said, that plans for enabling the poor to provide for
themselves would find more favour with the landlords if the alternative
was their providing for them? Truly an excellent device, and very like
reaching Paris by way of Constantinople. If you first succeed in
persuading or compelling the landlords to support the poor out of their
own pockets, you cannot imagine how readily you will get their consent
to its being done in another way which costs them nothing. We are
thankful for the advice; but, in the first place, their consent is not
wanted; and in the next, to obtain it in that way is leaping a
five-barred gate to save a turnstile.

Instead of facilitating, we are convinced that Mr. Scrope’s poor-law
would raise an almost insuperable obstacle to his plan of waste-land
location, or to any plan whatever for elevating the Irish poor by means
of their own industry. What is Mr. Scrope’s poor-law? To call it, as he
does, “the English Poor-law,” is playing upon words. He is not thinking
of the amended English law, the abused and calumniated New Poor-law. He
means no law grounded on the principle of making parish relief less
acceptable than the wages of independent labour. He means an ideal
poor-law of his own, on the basis of the statute of Elizabeth, and of
which the main principle is out-door relief by employment on public
works. Mr. Scrope well knows that in Ireland, as it now is, such relief
and employment cannot possibly be so given as not to be greatly more
desirable than the wages of work done for individuals. The consequence
would be that all private industry in Ireland would cease. At this very
time Irish labourers are leaving regular employment at high wages in
Scotland, and returning to Ireland to apply for the lower wages paid by
the Board of Works. They prefer lower wages, in return for work which
they perfectly well know to be, comparatively speaking, almost nominal.
In this small fact, and hundreds similar to it, Mr. Scrope may read the
certain effect of his favourite poor-law.

If Mr. Scrope could be satisfied with the extension to Ireland of the
only part of the reformed English system which she does not already
possess—the recognition of a legal right in the destitute to relief,
accompanying that right with such conditions as should prevent it from
being claimed but by those to whom it Edition: current; Page: [945] is
really indispensable5—our opinion would not be so fundamentally at
variance with his. We approve of this principle in the English system;
its practicability and safety, long contested by eminent political
economists, were, in our opinion, finally established by the Report of
the English Commissioners of Poor-law Inquiry in 1834;6 and we should be
very willing to entertain the question of extending it to Ireland,
supposing the Irish to be first dispauperized and in full employment
under an improved economical system, and at a time more favourable than
the present to the rational consideration of such questions. But any
kind of poor-law extension, even when in itself of a harmless nature, is
one of the most delicate operations in the art of government, requiring
all the preparation, caution, and scientific skill which befit those who
tamper with the most vital organs of the body politic, the main springs
of well-being and well-doing in the bulk of the population. Such things
are most unfit to be attempted at a time when those at whose instigation
chiefly they would be undertaken make a merit of defying every principle
of reason applicable to the subject. At the present moment the actuating
force in whatever was done would be a combination of two elements: a
blind impulse of feeling which calls itself humanity, the cheap humanity
which relieves distress, not by giving, but by making others give; and a
sort of new-light Toryism,7 which would willingly gain a fresh lease of
social pre-eminence for the aristocracy and squirearchy by making the
working classes once more their serfs and dependents in the form of
parish paupers.


327.: THE APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES UNDER THE NEW LOCAL COURTS ACT
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 12 NOV., 1846, P. 4

The passage of the Act establishing local courts, 9 & 10 Victoria, c. 95
(An Act for the More Easy Recovery of Small Debts and Demands in
England), which received royal assent on 28 Aug., 1846, was stormy, its
history going back to the agitation begun by Brougham in 1828, which was
effectively blocked by Lord Lyndhurst. The Act came into effect in
England and Wales in March 1847. This unheaded first leader is described
in Mill’s bibliography as “A leading article on the appointment of
judges under the new Local Courts Act, in the Morning Chron. of 12th
November 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 63).

an act will shortly come into operation, enacted during the last session
of Parliament, which in the importance of its eventual consequences may
rival even Edition: current; Page: [946] the great measure of commercial
enfranchisement1 which has made that session memorable. We refer to the
Act for the Establishment of Local Courts, and our reason for at present
adverting to it is that the distributors of patronage must be at this
very time actually occupied with the pleasing task of filling up the
numerous judicial offices created by it; a function of which it is no
exaggeration to say, that according as it is well or ill performed, the
new courts will be the most important step ever yet made in England in
the reform of law proceedings, or a ridiculous and disgraceful failure.

The arguments for local courts are sufficiently obvious and familiar. If
there is any use in having an administration of justice, it must be
useful that the justice administered should not be too far off to be
reached, nor too expensive and troublesome to be worth seeking. The
elementary and self-evident character of this truth, or truism, does not
at all diminish the necessity for vigorously insisting on it, since the
most obstinate resistance is often that which is maintained against the
most manifest truths. Obstinate and protracted was the resistance to
this. But at length we see it practically admitted, taking its place
among propositions legally recognized, even to the extent of founding an
institution upon it. Up to twenty pounds, it is good for Englishmen to
have justice all the year round, and in their own neighbourhood, at a
moderate expense, and with no more forms and technicalities than those
which really conduce to bringing the disputed question in a more perfect
state before the judge.2 Tardily, and with terrible pangs and throes,
the courts at Westminster have loosed their hold of a class of causes
which were not of sufficient pecuniary value to be worth their keeping,
and which had almost ceased to be brought before them. After so heroic a
sacrifice there are few things which may not be hoped; and at the
ordinary pace of legal improvement, we may flatter ourselves that
successive generations may see first twenty-five pounds, then thirty,
and at last, perhaps, even forty pounds assigned as the sum which the
right owner shall be permitted to recover from persons unlawfully
detaining it, in other towns of England and Wales besides London, at all
seasons of the year, and without unnecessary expense; or, at least, with
no more of it than the contrast afforded by the superior courts may
render the injured litigant only too happy to tolerate.

The most enlightened school of law reformers have long been deliberately
of opinion that the proper function of local courts is, not some
wretched little fragment of the business of judicature left to them
because their betters cannot stoop low enough to pick it up, but the
whole judicial business of the country in the first resort. The courts
at Westminster, much improved and simplified in their rules of practice,
should, in the opinion of these reformers, exist solely as courts of
appeal from the local tribunals, and as an authority to maintain
uniformity of Edition: current; Page: [947] principles, and to declare
the law in all cases of doubt; in which character and office there is
surely more than enough to satisfy the appetite for power and dignity of
the most eminent heads of the profession. We think this a just view of
the ultimate destination of local courts; and we should have rejoiced if
some account of that ultimate destination had been taken in first
constituting them. But the tentative character which very often ought to
belong to reforms, and which at any rate always does, made it inevitable
that when local judicature was attempted, it would begin its career with
some miserable scrap of jurisdiction; and unfortunately this is not one
of the cases in which the slow path is the path of safety, in which
there is less risk of failure by attempting little. To attempt little is
here the sure way to render failure probable.

Many years ago, when the time of Parliament and the thoughts of the
profession were first seriously occupied with the question of local
courts—when Lord Brougham, in his better days, reaped in this cause some
of his best-earned laurels, and Lord Lyndhurst added largely to his
peculiar kind of fame by the dexterous sophistry with which he resisted
a great principle3—it was then the prediction of judicious and
experienced friends of the cause, that the real difficulty of local
courts would be found to be the lamentable scarcity of persons fit to be
judges.4 The wider, however, the extent of authority given to the
courts, the less this difficulty would be felt. Supposing, as an extreme
case, that to these courts should be entrusted the original hearing of
all causes, or even of all civil causes, an appeal lying to the superior
courts, the importance of the office would be sufficient to make it be
sought by every member of the bar who was fit for it. It would be sought
for itself, as an office of great dignity and usefulness, affording an
ample field for every quality or talent, natural and acquired, of the
ablest and most instructed lawyer; and it would be sought also as a
road, not the sole, but certainly one of the most frequented roads, to
the highest station in the profession—the situation of an appeal judge.
The importance also of courts which would transact the whole judicial
business of a district equal in average size to an English county, would
secure to the judge, in addition to his own qualifications, the valuable
aid, and the not less valuable surveillance, of a bar. It may be
remembered, that one of the most potent of Lord Lyndhurst’s weapons in
his controversy against local courts was the argument, that no reliance
could be placed on either the judicial acumen or the legal knowledge of
a judge when Edition: current; Page: [948] unfurnished with a bar for
the double purpose of informing and of checking his judgment.5 That
mode, therefore, of constituting local courts which gives them most
chance of an adequate bar to practice in them, either habitually, or at
all events occasionally, would have been not only the best in itself,
but the safest to begin with, the most likely mode of making the
experiment successfully. The case is one of those more frequent than
statesmen are aware of, in which the more they attempt the more they are
likely to succeed in, while, by a timid and paltry willingness to
content themselves with little, they incur an almost certain risk of not
attaining even that little.

At present the danger is, that in courts limited to the cognizance of
small causes—that is, causes which are only important to small
people—any person of decent character, who has been a few years at the
bar, will be thought perfectly fit to be a judge: and that the local
judges will be chips of the same block out of which the magistrates of
the metropolitan police-courts have generally been cut. If so, the new
courts will either become the laughing stock of the country, or will
plod on in unnoticed mediocrity, doing their business just carefully and
just intelligently enough not to be scouted as a nuisance. Should this
happen, the principle itself will be permanently discredited, and it
will be long before we see another advance made towards bringing cheap
justice home to every door. This is not the spirit in which so truly
important a selection should be made. We have full confidence in the
purity of intentions of the Chancellor, Lord Cottenham,6 and as much
reliance on his judgment as on that of any other dispenser of patronage,
provided he can be induced to look at the matter in the serious light
which it deserves. In nominating men to these stations, he ought to
regard himself as doing much more than appointing people to try cases of
debt under £20 value. He is choosing men to be an example and a proof of
what local judges ought to be. He is appointing men to extort a
progressive enlargement of jurisdiction for the courts over which they
preside, by showing themselves fit to be invested with it. No one should
be nominated to these posts who is not fit for something much higher
than what they are at present entrusted with; who is not fit for any
judicial duties whatever, subject to the eventual revision of a superior
tribunal.

Even with the best intentions, and the deepest conscientious sense of
the importance of the trust, the Lord Chancellor will find his choice
grievously narrowed by the narrowness of the jurisdiction itself, which
holds out no temptation to any barrister of ambition and ability enough
to aspire to the high prizes of his profession. It is doubtless from a
foresight of this difficulty that the act has provided that the judges
shall not be prohibited from practising as Edition: current; Page: [949]
barristers;7 in hopes of making the office worth holding to the same
class of rising men who now, during a few years of their upward career,
willingly accept the post of recorder of a corporate town.8 But a
recorder’s attendance is only required at quarter sessions, and for a
few days at a time. The sittings of the new courts, if they are to be
more than a mere name, must occupy a very large portion of the time of
the judge, and ought, without doubt, to occupy the whole. It is a
deviation from the principle, and a great abatement of the
characteristic usefulness of a local court, not to be constantly open.
This sacrifice of usefulness was worth making, for the chance of
obtaining a somewhat better qualified class of judges; but let us not
forget that it is a sacrifice.


328.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [19]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 16 NOV., 1846, P. 4

For the context, see No. 306. This unheaded first leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A nineteenth leading article on Irish affairs in
the Morning Chronicle of 16th November 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 63).

convinced as we are of the sincere desire of all English politicians of
any standing or importance to do something, anything, that promises a
remedy, or even an alleviation, for the inveterate economical evils of
Ireland; and believing, as we rejoice to do, not only that there is a
remedy, but that it is the most obvious remedy conceivable—one which the
Legislature could carry into effective operation almost by merely
willing it, one which might actually make us believe in the existence of
some mischievous spell, when we think that it is still untried;
reflecting too that there are no powerful interests which this remedy
would even seem to jeopardize, no classes, scarcely even any individuals
whose pockets it could be suspected of injuring—very few whom it would
not considerably benefit; we ought, if reason and justice had no enemy
in this world but selfish interest, to feel the strongest confidence of
seeing it promptly adopted. Unhappily there is an obstacle to good,
almost as strong and far more universal than selfishness—the spirit of
routine. It takes much effort and a dreary length of time for men’s
understandings to admit the conviction that the thing they most want is
the very thing which they have never yet thought of seeking. Men are not
easily induced to submit to be cured, and still less to cure others, by
remedies which are not upon their list. It is thus with the remedy for
Ireland. A peasant Edition: current; Page: [950] proprietary, as a cure
for popular indigence, has not the honour of being in the Pharmacopoeia
Londinensis.1 To be sure, it stands at the very head of the political
Pharmacopoeia of every other country with any claim to civilization; and
if it had been the fortune of Ireland to be yoked to any country in
Europe besides England (or Russia), she would not have remained till
this time without having a full trial made of its efficacy. But that
does not make the matter much more easy. The whole work has yet to be
done. The public mind is quite ready to receive an impression, but the
impression remains to be made. The principle of a peasant proprietary
has no party. A party must be formed for it. The principle has many
approvers, but few zealots. Their zeal must be kindled.

To do this there is but one way—to place before the two countries, in a
detailed manner and with a sufficient degree of iteration, the abundant
evidence, both of reason and of fact, which demonstrates the admirable
effects of this system of territorial economy, considered generally, and
its peculiar adaptation to the circumstances of a country like Ireland.
The public, and even those who assume the character of teachers of the
public, are little aware of the weight of argument, fact, and authority
which may be adduced without difficulty on the point. They are still
less aware how perfectly obsolete have now become the facts, or supposed
facts, which one section of English economists—we are happy to say a
dwindling and declining section—were once enabled, by the universal
ignorance of the subject, to urge with a certain air of triumph in proof
of the destructive tendency of a minute division of landed property.
They know not how time and the irresistible tendency of things have made
sport of the dismal forewarnings which used to be heard from croakers on
this side of the Channel, respecting the destination of France to become
a “pauper-warren.”2 Within the twenty years or thereabouts which have
elapsed since these croakings were most rife, France has entered into
the most brilliant career of prosperity yet known in her industrial
history. Every authentic statistical account of the condition of her
industry and of her people has shown, and continues to show, that within
that period the state of her rural population, who are four-fifths of
the whole, has improved in every particular; that they are better
housed, better clothed, better and more abundantly fed; that their
agriculture has improved in quality; that all the productions of the
soil have multiplied beyond precedent; that the wealth of the country
has advanced, and advances with increasing rapidity, and the population
with increasing slowness. We challenge investigation of these facts, and
throw down the gauntlet to all gainsayers. Not that, if the result in
France had been quite contrary, any fair argument could have been
grounded Edition: current; Page: [951] upon it against the salutary
influence of peasant proprietorship. France has not only small
properties; she has a system of legislation purposely directed to
prevent the existence of large ones. She has an artificial law of
inheritance, restraining the power of bequest within narrow limits, and
compelling the equal division of the bulk of the property among all the
children.3 This is not the thing we are advocating for Ireland. It is
true, the effects of it are not approved or condemned by each, according
as he is affected towards that system of democratic institutions of
which it forms a part. But the warmest supporters of peasant properties
among the continental political economists—such, for example, as the
enlightened and philanthropic Sismondi—have held no less strongly that
it is desirable that large properties, in a certain number, should
co-exist with small ones.4 They are quite aware that peasant properties,
admirable for maintaining a good system of agriculture when once
introduced, are not adapted for originating scientific improvements, and
that for this purpose it is desirable that there should be in every
neighbourhood some cultivators of a wealthier class, who will take the
risk of experiments, and whose example, if successful, the peasant
proprietors may imitate.

But there is no danger that in Ireland large properties will be
exterminated by creating small properties on the waste land. The effect
will be the contrary. At present no Irish property has any of the
characteristic advantages of a large property, nor can have until
cleared of its cottier tenantry in the only way in which eternal justice
can tolerate its clearance—the only way, we may now be pardoned for
affirming, in which it is any longer possible that this clearance should
be effected. There are countries that have been very prosperous with
large properties, when attended by their characteristic and natural
accompaniment of large farms, and others which have thriven excellently
with small farms, when those farms have been small properties in the
hands of their peasant occupiers. Ireland alone has had the evil side of
both these states of social economy, without a particle of the good of
either; nothing but large properties cut up indefinitely into nothing
but small farms. But to give the name of farms at all to bits of potato
ground, let by a virtual auction, is such an understatement of the
pernicious barbarism of the vile thing as amounts almost to an apology
for it. This thing cannot be rooted out but by locating the superfluous
tenantry under a healthier system of tenure elsewhere. Do that, and the
great properties for the first time become great properties, for any of
the ends, public or private, for which large landed possessions are
adapted. You can then have efficient tools and economical culture, few
labourers, and a large net produce for profit and rent; and this without
injury to any one, because those who are now on your lands will Edition:
current; Page: [952] be raising a gross produce sufficient for their own
comfort and independence on land from which you now obtain nothing, and
instead of envying, will be themselves objects of envy and emulation to
your labourers for hire.

If it were reasonable to expect that men’s conduct would be determined
by their most direct and obvious interest, we should reckon upon an
unanimous clamour from every Irish landlord for thus disposing of the
superfluous numbers which they find so insupportable a millstone about
their necks. But it is a grievous fact that men will not easily see a
sober, steady, well-calculated affair of business in a thing which
savours of philanthropy. Their selfishness overreaches itself, and a
pecuniary advantage, which would be grasped at with avidity if it were
to be gained at some other person’s expense, is slighted and distrusted,
because the same thing which would put them in possession of it would
raise millions of beings of the same flesh and blood with themselves
from the depth of poverty to independence and happiness.


329.: THE CASE OF WILLIAM BURN
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 17 NOV., 1846, P. 4

Here Mill comments on a case heard on 10 Nov. and reported in “Police
Intelligence. Mansion House,” Morning Chronicle, 11 Nov., 1846, p. 7
(from which the quotations are taken) and also in The Times of the same
day, p. 6. It is the fifth of the comments on injustice and cruelty
jointly authored by Harriet Taylor and Mill (for the series, see No.
303). This unheaded second leader is described in Mill’s bibliography as
“A leading article on the case of one William Burn convicted of
ill-treating his horse; in the Morning Chronicle of 17th Nov. 1846. Very
little of this was mine.”

(MacMinn, p. 63.)

in a mansion-house report of last week, it is stated that one William
Burn was charged before the Lord Mayor1 “with having most cruelly beaten
one of the horses he was driving in a waggon. He had been sitting on the
middle horse, which was without reins, and he struck one of the poor
animals most desperately about the head with the butt-end of his whip.
The horse fell, and the prisoner struck it even more brutally when down.
The Lord Mayor expressed great indignation at the conduct of the
defendant, and was about to fine him to the utmost extent, when he
suddenly learned that he had a large family,” whereupon he said to him,
“You deserve the highest punishment; but I cannot think of punishing
your wife and children. The sentence of the court upon you is, that you
pay a fine of ten shillings, or be confined in the House of Correction
for fourteen days.” The defendant “thanked his lordship, and paid the
fine.”

Edition: current; Page: [953]
We regard this leniency, together with the reason assigned for it, as a
match for the most unthinking and ill-judged exercises of magisterial
discretion with which the London police-courts have lately favoured us.
“A large family” has long been familiar as an excuse for begging, and a
recommendation to the benevolent electors whose suffrages confer the
responsible office of parish beadle. Hereafter, it seems, it is to be a
license for violating the law, and, worse than that, for committing acts
of savage brutality, which excite not merely regret but indignation that
such a creature should have a wife and children in his power to treat in
the same manner.

Let us look at the thing first on the general principles of the
administration of justice. The Lord Mayor thought the man deserved the
full penalty, and was about to inflict it. He thought, therefore, that
the highest fine which the law authorised, forty shillings, or in
default of payment fourteen days in the House of Correction (for the law
actually allows no longer term),2 would not have been more than enough
to make some impression upon the man’s obdurate nature, and induce him
and others like him to put some restraint upon their brutality. And who
will not agree with the Lord Mayor in so thinking? Rather, who will not
go far beyond him? Who does not see that the maximum penalty ought to be
much higher; that it is ridiculously and lamentably inadequate; that it
was fixed so low, not because it was thought sufficient, but because the
promoters of the bill were too happy to get the consent of the
Legislature to any penalty at all, in order at least to establish the
fact that the law disapproves and stigmatises ferocious abuse of power
against the helpless? This recognition, we suspect, is the chief part of
the good which the Act against Cruelty to Animals has yet done; and even
that, the insignificance of the penalties in a great measure
neutralizes, for if those who commit the crime are now aware that their
superiors think it wrong, they cannot suppose that it is thought to be
anything very bad by people who are so very much more than gentle in
their repression of it.

But to return to the Lord Mayor. He thought, at any rate, that forty
shillings, or imprisonment for fourteen days, was not more than
sufficient severity to give the man a salutary lesson. If forty
shillings were not more than enough, ten shillings are less than enough;
and the man is let off with a penalty which the magistrate knows to be
insufficient to correct his own vicious habits and to deter others. And
this because the Lord Mayor “cannot think of punishing” the wife and
children. In the first place, the instantaneous payment of the ten
shillings renders it more than probable that ample means existed for a
fortnight’s support. In the second place, did the law intend that the
inconvenience which a man’s wife and children may suffer, from penalties
imposed on himself, should be a reason for not inflicting the punishment
which he has merited by his misdeeds? Would the Lord Mayor have given
him the benefit of this excuse if he had stolen Edition: current; Page:
[954] a handkerchief? No, truly; there would have been no thought then
of hardship to the family, although in that case the offence might
actually have been committed to relieve their hunger; and at any rate,
the offender would not have been proved to be the kind of man from whom
it would be a mercy to have separated them.

Real consideration for the wife and children would have spoken a very
different language to the magistrate. It would have said something like
this—A man capable of the act of which this man is found guilty, must be
one of two things. He is either a wretch who wantonly ill-treats a
helpless being, for the pleasure of tyranny, because it is in his power
and cannot resist; or an irritable, violent creature, who on the
smallest provocation (provocation from the unconscious dumb animal who
slaves to death for his benefit!) flies into an uncontrollable rage, and
cannot restrain himself from wreaking a savage vengeance. One of these
two characters the man must be; and on either supposition we may infer
what sort of a taskmaster he is to the unfortunate woman and the
unfortunate children, who are as much in his power, and much more liable
to rouse his ferocious passions than the animal over whom he tyrannised.
It really seems to us, that they are more objects of pity for being
compelled to live with such a man than they would have been for being
deprived during a whole fortnight of his agreeable society, and that it
would have been a greater kindness to them to have seized the
opportunity of giving a severe lesson to one who had the power of making
so many human creatures miserable. If he could have been made less
brutal to his horses it would have made him less brutal to his human
victims likewise. Disgusting enough it is that animals like these should
have wives and children; and disgusting that, merely because they are of
the male sex, they should have the whole existence of these dependants
as much under their absolute control as slave masters in any modern
slave country have that of their slaves; and without even the wretched
compensation of supporting them—for in that rank the wife always, and
the children by the time they are seven or eight years old, take part,
to the full measure of their physical strength, in the labours for the
support of the family. But as if all this was not enough, the man is
told by a magistrate, that because he has a family to ill-use, he may
indulge himself in ill-using any other creatures who come in his way,
and may practise on them the amiable propensities of which his family
are to reap the full enjoyment. We have no doubt the Lord Mayor meant
kindly; but the tender mercies of thoughtless people are cruel; and we
wish that, instead of being thanked by the ruffian whom he let off, he
had deserved the thanks of the public for a rigorous exercise of the
most important moral power a magistrate possesses—that of putting down
strongly and manfully, by word and deed, the brutal vices of the worst
part of the populace.

330.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [20]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 19 NOV., 1846, P. 4

In this, the first of several articles quoting others’ testimony to the
value of peasant land-owning, Mill draws on Arthur Young, Travels during
the Years 1787, 1788, and 1789 (1792), 2nd ed., 2 vols. (London and Bury
St. Edmunds: Richardson, 1794). See also Nos. 334, 336, 339, and 340.
For the context of the series, see No. 306. This unheaded first leader
is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A twentieth leading article on
Irish affairs in the Morning Chronicle of 19th November 1846 (peasant
properties)”

(MacMinn, p. 63).

we have maintained throughout, that the means by which any permanent
alleviation can be effected of the economical evils of Ireland must not
be economical solely; they must belong to that class of economical means
which have a moral efficacy. The main superiority of the remedial
measures which we advocate consists in this—that they would surround the
peasant with a new moral atmosphere; they would bring a set of motives
to operate upon him which he has never before experienced, tending in
the strongest manner to correct everything in his national character
which needs correction. Without a change in the people, the most
beneficent change in their mere outward circumstances would not last a
generation. You will never change the people unless you make themselves
the instruments, by opening to them an opportunity to work out for
themselves all the other changes. You will never change the people but
by changing the external motives which act on them, and shape their way
of life from the cradle to the grave. Much has been said of popular
education: but education does not mean schools and school books; these
are most valuable, but only as preparations and as auxiliaries. The real
effective education of a people is given them by the circumstances by
which they are surrounded. The laws are the great schoolmaster, as the
ancient statesmen and philosophers well knew, and it is time we should
again learn the lesson. What shapes the character is not what is
purposely taught, so much as the unintentional teaching of institutions
and social relations. It is of little use inculcating industry,
prudence, and obedience to law, if every thing which the peasant,
throughout life, sees and hears, tells him, in much more intelligible
language than yours, that he has nothing to gain by industry or
prudence, and everything to lose by submitting to the law. Nothing that
you can say will alter the state of his mind, only something that you
can do. Make it his interest to be industrious and prudent, and engage
his interest on the side of the law. And if you have inveterate habits
of the contrary description to overcome, there is the more need of
presenting the motives which tend to correct those habits in the shape
in which they will be most intense and palpable.

The grand fundamental defects in the character and habits of the Irish
peasant are want of industry and want of providence. We do not add the
common Edition: current; Page: [956] reproach of lawlessness, for the
meaning of that is now perfectly well understood. Rockism and
Whiteboyism are not qualities of his nature, but hard consequences of
his desperate situation.1 The world now knows that the Irish are among
the most easily governed of all people, provided you do not attempt to
take away their daily potatoes.

Our position is, that for an agricultural people, whose deficiencies are
want of industry and want of providence, the remedy of remedies is to
give them a property in the soil: that for creating the intensest spirit
of persevering industry it is altogether unrivalled; that in this part
of its office it never fails, and seldom in the other part, the
generation of prudence and forethought. We propose to corroborate this
opinion, by adducing from time to time the results of experience and the
testimony of skilful observers specifically on these points.

We shall begin with the subject of industry, because so much has of late
been said of the deficiency of the Irish in this quality; because it is
the part of the subject best understood in this country, where it is a
much more familiar idea that industry, than that prudence, is an
indispensable quality in working people; and, finally, because industry
really is the more fundamental of the two. Many working people are
eminently industrious without being prudent; but you will seldom find
one who is prudent without being industrious; since the same
recklessness of the future, and habit of self-indulgence, which make him
dislike work, make him à fortiori insensible to those distant
consequences, in a proper estimate of which, as compared with present
inclinations, the virtue of prudence consists.

Now, on the efficacy of peasant properties as an incentive to industry,
there is but one unanimous voice among observers of all opinions,
provided they had the means of seeing with their own eyes. We shall take
our first evidence from the very heart of the enemy’s camp. We summon
Arthur Young to bear witness for us. This high authority was not, on the
whole, a favourer of small landed properties. He was an earnest promoter
of large farms, and of what is called scientific agriculture—that is to
say, of the modes of culture which aim only at augmenting the net
produce without regard to the gross. His experience of the petite
culture was mostly gathered in Ireland, and in France before the
Revolution, the two places in all Europe where, from accidental
circumstances, its effects exhibited themselves in the most
disadvantageous light. Yet on the one point, of the effect of small
properties on industry, he speaks a language undistinguishable from that
of an enthusiastic partisan. Wherever, in travelling through France, he
finds careful and laborious cultivation, he sets it down, Edition:
current; Page: [957] sometimes even without inquiry, as the effect of
peasant proprietorship. Describing a walk to Rossendal, near Dunkirk, he
says:

Between the town and that place is a great number of neat little houses,
built each with its garden, and one or two fields enclosed of most
wretched blowing dune sand, naturally as white as snow, but improved by
industry. The magic of property turns sand to gold.

[Vol. I, p.88.]

Again, in the south of France:

Leaving Sauve, I was much struck with a large tract of land, seemingly
nothing but huge rocks, yet most of it enclosed and planted with the
most industrious attention. Every man has an olive, a mulberry, an
almond, or a peach tree, and vines scattered among them, so that the
whole ground is covered with the oddest mixture of these plants and
bulging rocks that can be conceived. The inhabitants of this village
deserve encouragement for their industry; and if I were a French
minister they should have it: they would soon turn all the deserts
around them into gardens. Such a knot of active husbandmen, who turn
their rocks into scenes of fertility, because I suppose their own, would
do the same by the wastes, if animated by the same omnipotent principle.

[Ibid., p. 50.]

In another place:

Going out of Gange, I was surprised to find by far the greatest exertion
in irrigation which I had yet seen in France; and then pass by some
steep mountains highly cultivated in terraces. From Gange, to the
mountain of rough ground which I crossed, the ride has been the most
interesting which I have taken in France, the efforts of industry the
most vigorous, the animation the most lively. An activity has been here
that has swept away all difficulties before it, and has cloathed the
very rocks with verdure. It would be a disgrace to common sense to ask
the cause: the enjoyment of property must have done it. Give a man the
secure possession of a bleak rock, and he will turn it into a garden;
give him a nine years’ lease of a garden, and he will convert it into a
desert.

[Ibid., p. 51.]

Again, at the foot of the Western Pyrenees—

Came to a scene which was so new to me in France, that I could hardly
believe my own eyes. A succession of many well-built, tight, and
comfortable farming cottages, built of stone and covered with tiles,
each having its little garden, inclosed by clipt thorn hedges, with
plenty of peach and other fruit trees, some fine oaks scattered in the
hedges, and young trees nursed up with so much care that nothing but the
fostering attention of the owner could effect anything like it. To every
house belongs a farm, perfectly well inclosed, with grass borders, mown
and neatly kept around the corn-fields, with gates to pass from one
inclosure to another. There are some parts of England (where small
yeomen still remain) that resemble this country of Béarn; but we have
very little that is equal to what I have seen in this ride of twelve
miles from Pau to Moneng. It is all in the hands of little proprietors,
without the farms being so small as to occasion a vicious and miserable
population. An air of neatness, warmth, and comfort breathes over the
whole. It is visible in their new-built houses and stables, in their
little gardens, in their hedges, in the courts before their doors; even
in the coops for their poultry, and the sties for their hogs. A peasant
does not think of rendering his pig comfortable, if his own happiness
hangs by the thread of a nine years’ lease. We are now in Béarn, within
a few miles of the cradle of Henry IV. Do they inherit these blessings
from that good prince? The benignant genius of Edition: current; Page:
[958] that good monarch seems to reign still over the country. Each
peasant has the fowl in the pot.

[Ibid., p. 56.]2

In summing up, afterwards, the final result of his observations, which
was not favourable to the general quality of the agriculture on small
farms, even when the occupier was the proprietor, Arthur Young remarks
that, except in a few instances, he—

Saw nothing respectable in small properties, except a most unremitting
industry. Indeed, it is necessary to impress on the reader’s mind that,
though the husbandry I met with, in a great variety of instances, on
little properties, was as bad as can well be conceived, yet the industry
of the possessors was so conspicuous and so meritorious that no
commendations would be too great for it. It was sufficient to prove that
property in land is, of all others, the most active instigator to severe
and incessant labour. And this truth is of such force and extent, that I
know no way so sure of carrying tillage to a mountain top as by
permitting the adjoining villagers to acquire it in property; in fact,
we see that, in the mountains of Languedoc, &c., they have conveyed
earth in baskets, on their backs, to form a soil where nature had denied
it.

[Ibid., p. 412.]

What he says of the bad agriculture on small properties needs not at
present concern us; we shall touch on that part of the subject
hereafter. The evidence is that of an opponent, and we give it in proof
that even an opponent who knows anything of the subject cannot withhold
a testimony, which may well satisfy the most ardent partisan, to the
efficacy of small properties as a counteractive against the indolence
and insouciance which are the most prominent recognized defects of the
Irish peasant. And what wonder? Of all tillers of the soil, the cottier
is the one who has least to gain by any voluntary exertion; the small
proprietor has most. That the one should be the idlest and the other the
most diligent of all peasants, actual or possible, is but the natural
result of their circumstances. Put each in the situation of the other,
and their characters will be reversed. Give the Irishman “the secure
possession of a bleak rock” or a turf bog, and he too “will turn it into
a garden.” He will be as easily induced as his kindred Celts across the
Channel, to “convey earth in baskets” to form a soil on the terraced
side of a hill, if the hill-side when terraced and the soil when laid
down are to be his own.


331.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [21]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 24 NOV., 1846, P. 4

This article comments on the meeting of landlords at Dungarvon on 13
Nov., which recommended reclamation of waste lands. The meeting had been
briefly noted in Edition: current; Page: [959] “Waterford County
Meeting,” Morning Chronicle, 17 Nov., p. 6, and then reported more fully
in “The County of Waterford Meeting,” ibid., 21 Nov., p. 6, from which
the quotations have been taken. For the context of the series, see No.
306. This unheaded first leader is described in Mill’s bibliography as
“A twenty first leading article on Irish affairs in the Morning
Chronicle of 24th Nov. 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 63).

our readers may have noticed the resolutions of a meeting at Dungarvon,
comprising the principal magistrates and landed proprietors of the
county of Waterford, which are honourably distinguished from every other
manifestation that has yet met our eyes of the sentiments of the landed
gentry of Ireland upon the present emergency. Such meetings have usually
been barren of any one single indication that the minds or hearts of
that much-complaining, much-afflicted class have expanded to meet the
demand now made on them for something like intellect and for something
approaching to patriotism. What amount of feeling and wisdom may lie
pent up within them, waiting for some better opportunity of coming
forth, we do not pretend to judge. Hitherto the only sentiment which
they had thought it becoming to testify was a tender concern for the
pockets of the landlords, and that feeling had as yet suggested no more
recondite expedient for accomplishing its object than to get as much
money from the Imperial Treasury as possible, repaying as little of it,
and that little at as distant a date as ministerial good nature might
allow.

But the Dungarvon meeting is the beginning we hope of a new era. The
resolutions of the Waterford gentry are conceived in a spirit somewhat
different. We cannot say indeed that there is not much still to amend.
Landlords will be landlords. In England and Scotland, and still more in
Ireland, they have been too much accustomed to the homage of others not
to have a very sincere loyalty to themselves. They are the spoilt
children of society. They have been taught to believe that government,
social institutions, and the human species itself exist mainly for their
protection and exaltation. If actual confiscation did not drive this
idea out of the heads of the French territorial aristocracy, and the
generation who had been brought up in that ancient faith had to die off
before the creed could be unlearned, it would be quixotic to expect
that, even allowing for the great difference between this age and the
last, so complete a mental revolution should be effected in the Irish
gentry by the mere sight of confiscation drawing near to them. We really
must not require that they should renounce the pleasing illusion of
their own vast importance to the community. It would be too hard to tell
them that, saving the general interest which all mankind have in
justice, it is a matter of very small importance whether the land is
owned by its present possessors or by others, or rather the public would
be benefited by its being transferred to any others who would either
hold it or be willing to grant it on a better tenure. There are some
truths which cannot, consistently with politeness, be mentioned in the
hearing of landlords, any more than certain remarks on the Church or its
articles are permissible in the presence of a clergyman. Without
requiring a renunciation Edition: current; Page: [960] of the faith of
landlordism, we must hail as a sign of grace anything approaching to a
liberal interpretation of that faith, and we therefore welcome and
applaud a body of Irish landowners who present themselves before
Government and the country with a resolution like the following:

We are of opinion that immediate measures should be taken by the
Legislature for causing the waste and unoccupied lands of the country to
be brought into cultivation, and for settling upon them that portion of
the population for whose labour there exists no natural demand in their
respective localities; and that with this view commissioners should be
appointed, with power to purchase or take a lease of the lands that
might be found suitable for their purposes from the owners thereof at a
valuation, and to select the settlers from the townlands in which the
population may appear to be most dense, in proportion to the poor-law
valuation.

This is something! A light begins to pierce through the darkness. The
lands are overcrowded, to the injury of everything and everybody, the
land, the landlords, and the people. Close to these overcrowded lands
(we use the word close in its literal sense, and we shall produce facts
to bear out our assertion) lie other lands, of vast extent, perfectly
capable of cultivation, and entirely uninhabited. After long ages, a
meeting of Irish gentry has succeeded in putting the two ideas together
of bringing these two things together. They have long groaned under the
burthen of the surplus people on the right hand side of the high road,
and the idea has just struck them that the unoccupied lands on the left
are the very place to turn them into. If we may judge from the long time
which has been required for making this step, it is not one of small
magnitude. Nevertheless it is not everything. There are a few questions
yet to ask. We want to know in what capacity the surplus people are to
be settled on these lands? “Settlers” is a word of considerable
ambiguity. We desire to be informed for whose benefit the lands are to
be reclaimed? It is very easy to see what the landlords may gain by
having their unnecessary hands provided for elsewhere. But we are
curious to learn whether any of the gain is to be left for other people?

We lament to say that the answers to these questions are not
satisfactory. The Waterford gentry have made a hopeful first step, but
that is all. Our promising pupils have not got beyond letter A. They
must make haste to learn the remainder of the alphabet.

The resolutions proceed: “That, upon the reclamation (?) of their
purchase or lease, the reclamation and culture of said lands should be
carried on under the direct superintendence and control of the
commissioners.”1 Halte-là, mon ami. Do we believe our ears? The
reclamation and culture of the lands to be carried on by the
commissioners? Reclamation as much as you please: that is a thing to be
once done, and done with: no one but a public authority can do it,
because it Edition: current; Page: [961] requires a system of operations
for draining large tracts of country at once; and the thing is not more
difficult or troublesome than making a railway, or employing the poor as
the Government is now employing them, or than any extensive public work.
But culture? Is the Board of Works to be farmer-general of Ireland, in
quite a different from the French sense of the term? Are several million
acres of the land of Ireland to be erected into an experimental farm, to
be carried on by Government officials, with Government capital, every
cottage, outhouse, hedge, or ditch, all ploughs and hoes, seed and
manure being supplied, and all labour paid, under the orders of a board,
and from the taxes of Great Britain? Was ever such task undertaken by a
Government? Was ever such proposal made by any body of sane persons to a
Government? Yet let us listen patiently. There is surely something
behind. If Government are entreated to do what no Government was ever
asked to do before, it is surely for some public benefit more splendid
than was ever before realised. The hindrances to Irish prosperity are
undoubtedly to be all swept off by this mighty exertion. One grand
effort of the Government is to reform the whole social system of the
country, and dry up permanently all the sources of poverty.

We grieve to say that the aspirations of the Waterford gentry are quite
in another direction. Our readers will be surprised to learn that the
purpose for which the waste lands of Ireland are to be, under public
authority, and at the public expense, reclaimed and cultivated, is, that
after they have been thus made valuable they may be given back to the
landlords. The resolution proceeds—“And that, upon the State being
repaid for its outlay, there should be an opportunity afforded the
original proprietor in the first instance,” and only “on his refusal, to
the colonists, of redeeming the lands so reclaimed.” The “original
proprietor” is the person whose ancestor had the land granted to him in
the days of Tyrone or of Cromwell,2 since which not a sixpence has been
laid out on it by any member of the family, and not a sixpence received
from it, except perhaps for the privilege of cutting turf; the family,
with that single exception, having never exercised any one of the
attributes of ownership over the land, but that of preventing other
people from making use of it.

No, gentlemen; you will not have the consent of the English people to
your notable project. The land of the country was originally the
property of the country; we suppose nobody will dispute that. The
country, wisely or unwisely, parted with its right, and gave away the
land to individuals. There is a portion of it which those individuals
have never used, and this you are willing that the State should redeem
at the full value; and nobody wishes that it should pay less than the
value. But when the State has bought back this land, it is the State’s,
not Edition: current; Page: [962] yours, and you have not a shadow of
any further claim on it. To give it to you would not be restitution, but
a fresh grant, and the State has something else to do with public
property than to give to the rich. It will now give, saving your
presence, to those who are fitter objects of its care. It will say to
you, “You have had all the land; you still have all of it that you have
made worth anything, even to yourselves. Be thankful for that, and
endeavour to make a better use of it than you have done. What still
remains is the estate of the wretched—of those for whom property has
never before existed, to whom law and government have yet been known by
nothing but their pains and penalties. What we have is not more than
enough for them, and we intend that it should be sacred to their use,
and as their inheritance.”

 MORNING CHRONICLE, 25 NOV., 1846, P. 4

For the context, see No. 306. This unheaded leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A twenty second leading article on Irish
affairs, in the Morning Chronicle of 25th November 1846 (the second
leader)”

(MacMinn, p. 64).

in discussing the question of the reclamation of Irish waste lands, we
have not hitherto troubled our readers with statistics. Round numbers
have contented us, because such was the strength of our case, that it
could bear any abatement which the most recalcitrant opponent would
think of demanding. We could afford to give up half, two-thirds,
three-fourths of our estimate of the waste land, and still leave enough
for realizing, to such an extent as to be infinitely valuable, our two
objects, the removal of the surplus hands from the present cultivated
surface, and the location of those surplus numbers in the independent
and honourable character of proprietors of the soil they cultivate. We
could reasonably content ourselves with the aperçu of Mr. Thornton, who
estimated the whole extent of waste lands at considerably more than six
millions, of which three-fifths are improvable, while six hundred
thousand acres would be sufficient to establish as small proprietors
one-fourth of the whole peasant population of Ireland.1

But in the progress of the discussion, this rough estimate has ceased to
be sufficient; we are called upon to justify the high scale of our
expectations from this source, and to produce chapter and verse for the
quantity of reclaimable land. There are writers who, since attention has
begun to be directed to the waste lands as a national resource, have
begun to tell us that the Irish wastes are not of a quality to be worth
reclaiming; that Irish bog soil is of a peculiar antiseptic Edition:
current; Page: [963] quality, and incapable of fertility; that reclaimed
wastes are always tending to fall back into their original state; and
that the expense of reclaiming them exceeds the market price of the fee
simple of the best old lands.

The nature of bog and peat soils, and the obstacles which they oppose to
fertilization, are no such unknown and mysterious subjects that those
who come forward at this time of day with a simple statement of them
have much chance of enlightening the world. We may presume that these
things were well known to Arthur Young, when he said that on the Irish
wastes was to be practised the most profitable husbandry in the King’s
dominions;2 and the many subsequent authorities who have made
statements, more or less positive, to a similar effect, have not, we
suppose, been ignorant of the worst that could be said respecting the
unreclaimable character of peat bogs. Everybody who has any right to an
opinion on such matters, is aware that the fertilization of soils of the
description alluded to depends on permanent manures; that the inherent
quality of the soil must be modified by the admixture of new
ingredients; and as these cannot be brought from a great distance
without swallowing up the whole profit in the expense, the question
mainly depends on the existence of the necessary materials in some near
and accessible situation, or (still better) in the subsoil itself. It is
incumbent on us, in descending to particulars, to be able to show that
these conditions have been duly taken into account by the authorities
whom we follow. We refer, then, to the latest and most careful estimate
of the Irish wastes, and of their capabilities of improvement, an
estimate made with express reference to these very difficulties, and to
the means which each locality affords of overcoming them. We refer to
the paper by Mr. Griffith, general valuation commissioner, printed at
the end of the report of Lord Devon’s commission.3

Mr. Griffith estimates the extent of the waste lands of Ireland at
6,290,000 acres, of which 3,755,000 are improvable, being, as nearly as
possible, Mr. Thornton’s estimate of three-fifths. Of these, however,
2,330,000 are in his opinion improvable only for “coarse meadow,
together with pasture for sheep and young cattle,” leaving 1,425,000
acres, which “might be advantageously reclaimed and improved, so as to
produce both corn and green crops.”4 Here, therefore, on an estimate
studiously low, in which every abatement was made which was deemed
necessary by a practised land valuer, taking into account all
difficulties, there remains nearly a million and a half of acres capable
of being Edition: current; Page: [964] converted into valuable arable
land, with a much larger extent of pasturage to support cattle, and keep
up a supply of manure. Of some of these lands Mr. Griffith says, that
they “offer great facility for improvement, inasmuch as there is
abundance of clay and gravel immediately beneath the bogs, which are
frequently shallow, and, in consequence, the surface when drained can be
easily and cheaply coated with the subsoil.”5 Where experiments have
been made, as in the Crown lands of Kingwilliamstown, in the county of
Cork, under the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, lands which were
valued for sale at the rate of fourpence per acre per annum, have been
raised to a value varying from 7s. 6d. to 20s. an acre.

Mr. Griffith’s figures also afford some important results with respect
to the locality of these waste lands, as connected with the local
distribution of the surplus population, and of the sufferers by the
potato failure. Seven counties in the west and south-west of Ireland
contain more than one-half of the entire extent of improvable waste.
These counties are Mayo, Galway, Roscommon, Clare, Limerick, Kerry, and
Cork. These same counties, according to the statement in our paper of
Friday last,6 supply 107,634, being more than two-thirds, of the number
of persons now receiving Government wages for useless public works. This
wasteful squandering is going on in the immediate neighbourhood of the
great unoccupied field of productive employment. In one of these
counties, Clare, there are thus unprofitably employed 23,899 persons,
being more than one in three of the able-bodied male population. The
payment of wages to these, together with the expense of superintendence,
cannot be much less than ten thousand pounds per week, being at the rate
of half a million a year. The rated annual value of all the land in the
county is but £292,000. Say that only half the outlay now going on is
ever repaid by the landlords, it absorbs the whole year’s income. Is it
not time that they looked about them? Are appeals to mercy respecting
the amount and date of repayment, all they rely upon to avert the
confiscation now staring them in the face?

If the potato disease continues, these people cannot find their own
subsistence where they are, even in the wretched manner to which they
are accustomed. It is certain that they will not be allowed to starve;
the English nation will not maintain them, and their landlords cannot,
unless by drafting them off to other lands. Is it not wonderful that an
unanimous voice has not been raised from the landlords, at least of
these seven counties, for locating the peasantry on the waste lands?
Would not any mode of locating them be the salvation of the landlords
from ruin? and is it for them to higgle, and make conditions for their
own pockets, with the hand which is held out to save them?

333.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [23]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 27 NOV., 1846, P. 4

This article comments on a scheme of peasant proprietorship advocated in
“Waste Lands—Peasant Proprietors,” Nation, 14 Nov., 1846, p. 88, from
which the quotations are taken. For the context of the series, see No.
306. This unheaded leader is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A
twenty third leading article on Irish affairs, in the Morning Chronicle
of 27th Nov. 1846 (the second leader)”

(MacMinn, p. 64).

while we have been exerting ourselves, by such means as belong to our
vocation, to make the crisis in Ireland an occasion of procuring for
that unfortunate country the inestimable benefit of a peasant
proprietary, modestly limiting our plan to what we thought practicable,
the waste lands, which we were the more willing to do because those
lands are sufficient, if properly employed, to accomplish all the
essentials of our purpose; our contemporary, the Nation, the organ of
the junior Repealers, has engaged in a more ambitious, and a rather more
arduous task, that of compassing the same object over the entire surface
of Ireland—of obtaining proprietary rights for every improving tenant,
by the consent and voluntary grant of the present landlords. We have
much sympathy with the unworldly enthusiasm which prompts the attempt;
it is quite in keeping with the chivalrous spirit in which repeal and
Irish nationality are cherished by our contemporary; and though, for our
own part, we should as soon think of turning missionaries to convert the
Pope to Protestantism, or the Emperor Nicholas to representative
government, it is interesting to see in any political character, and
especially in any public journalist, so confiding a faith in human
intellect and virtue.

The article which we have chiefly in view, in the Nation of November
14th, has a strong tincture of what, for want of a better name, we must
take the liberty of calling landlordism. The writer, if not a landlord,
is near of kin to one, for he entertains the opinion, peculiar, so far
as we have observed, to that honourable class, that they are a very
ill-used body. And by whom do our readers suppose that they are
ill-used? In the name of all that is eccentric, by the English
Legislature and Government!

In all speculations about Ireland, your English statesman, especially
your Whig, regards landlords and tenants as natural enemies—cannot get
rid of the impression that here are two classes, one of which may never
thrive without ruining and oppressing the other. . . . So, when a scheme
of public works had to be contrived for Ireland, your English statesman
could not endure the thought that any benefit should arise therefrom to
the landlords; for are not they the men who grind the poor, who devour
the widow and the fatherless?1 Are not they the heartless Irish
landlords—the rackrenting Irish landlords? Is Edition: current; Page:
[966] it not better to pay public wages for hammering down the Gaultees
into road-metal than to reclaim or drain a perch of land for them?

We do not expect the writers in the Nation to know anything of English
feeling, though they certainly do abuse the privilege of being ignorant
of it, when they ascribe to “English statesmen”—landlords themselves,
put where they are by landlords, and until the spring of this year2 so
landlord-ridden as to go on taxing the people’s bread to please the
landlords—these remarkably anti-landed opinions concerning the influence
of landlords in general upon the welfare of their tenantry. But let that
pass. Irish writers, however, should know something of Irish history,
and Irish patriots something of the real nature of their country’s
wrongs. It is the characteristic, it seems, of English statesmen to
think, say, and do everything that is uncomplimentary with respect to
Irish landlords. We thought, for our part, that Irish landlords were
their petted children, and that hitherto it had been merely ask and
have. For whose sake, and by whose hands, did England misgovern Ireland
from the beginning? For the sake and by the hands of the Irish
landlords. England never had any interest in misgoverning the Irish;
England never undertook their government. She turned them over to a
native oligarchy, an oligarchy of Irish, though not of Celtic Irish; and
upheld this oligarchy by the whole strength of her own military power.
In doing this she hit unconsciously upon a recipe for the most atrocious
government which could have been devised by the human faculties
studiously directed to that purpose. Far better would it have been for
Ireland, on a choice of evils, to have been treated directly and
avowedly as an English province or dependency. She then would have been
governed as Napoleon would have governed her, or as the English govern
India: she would not have had what little she had of freedom, the forms
of it; but she would have had equal laws between man and man, security
for person and property, an efficient police, and an impartial
administration of justice. Instead of this, we left her to her own
landlords, and the tyranny, corruption, and lawlessness which have made
Irish government a bye-word among nations were their work.

Those times, indeed, are gone; the English Parliament, we may flatter
ourselves, has now fairly broken with the dominant section of Irish
landlords, the old “Protestant ascendancy;”3 and we scarcely think they
will ever be the ruling potentates of Ireland again. We wish we felt as
sure that there was an end to the prescriptive right they have long
claimed, of dipping their hands, as often as convenient, into the public
purse. But it is not more than a few years since Parliament gave away to
the Irish landlords, at one stroke, thirty per cent. of the tithes,
besides paying three years tithes of the whole country, to the tune of a
Edition: current; Page: [967] million sterling, of which it never
demanded repayment, and which, like everything nominally given to the
tenants in a cottier system, was simply a present to the landlords.4
That this kind of liberality is likely to be repeated, in the present
instance, we would not advise them to reckon: but it is evident they
think it is; nothing else can explain the reckless profusion of their
presentments for public works, which would have been made with
considerably less alacrity had they really thought that the threat of
requiring repayment was meant seriously. We recommend to the Nation,
since it is bent on rousing them from their apathy, to try the effect of
assuring them that the threat is serious, and that the money must
actually be paid. But we fear they would never credit it. Lending public
money to Irish landlords, and getting any of it back, are two ideas that
cannot be made to coalesce; and though we sincerely hope that the thing
is destined to be tried, we are certain that it never will be believed
until it is done.

What the Nation attempts to alarm them with is something of another
kind. It tells them they may look for a red-tape, blue-book commission
to take charge of their estates:

That a general system of reclaiming waste lands, accompanied by organic
changes in tenure, will inevitably come, and speedily, is plain to all
who do not obstinately keep their eyes shut; and that it will be done by
a horde (or what they call a board) of ignorant and insolent government
commissioners, and that in the most offensive, most wasteful, least
equitable, and least effectual manner is just as evident, unless the
landlords of Ireland, once for all, make common cause with their
countrymen, and take this business into their own hands. And they can do
so if they will. They can originate the plan themselves; they can demand
and obtain such power over their estates as will enable them to make
fee-farm grants to all improving and reclaiming tenants, submitting, at
the same time, to obligatory clauses, which will compel the reluctant
members of their order to make such grants. They can require that public
expenditure in Ireland shall be applied in the meantime to promote these
improvements, and can guarantee its repayment out of the proceeds. . . .
All this the landlords of Ireland can do; and all this they must do, if
they would meet the exigency of the case, and save themselves and their
country from the horrible infliction of a worse commission than any we
have yet laboured under.

The rest is fee-fo-fum, which the landlords must be of very simple
composition indeed if they are at all frightened at:

A commission which will thrust itself into all men’s business,
constitute itself receiver over their estates, trustee of their family
settlements, regulator of their private contracts; a commission whose
operation will much resemble that of a commission in bankruptcy—to
realise what can be made out of an impoverished estate, apportion their
dividends to all claimants upon the wasted fund, and leave all parties
in worse plight than it found them.

334.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [24]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 30 NOV., 1846, P. 4

For the context, see Nos. 306 and 330. This unheaded leader is described
in Mill’s bibliography as “A twenty fourth leading article on Irish
affairs, in the Morning Chronicle of 30th November 1846 (the second
leader) (peasant properties)”

(MacMinn, p. 64).

in pursuance of our purpose of illustrating the general benefits of
peasant properties, and their peculiar adaptation to the exigencies of
such a country as Ireland, we quoted from Arthur Young’s Travels in
France some passages in which that accurate observer, and favourite
authority of the modern English agricultural school, described, with his
usual vivacity and emphasis, the unrivalled spirit of industry which, as
his experience taught him, everywhere accompanied the possession of a
property in the soil by the tiller of it.1 For the sake of so powerful a
testimony from one who might be considered an opponent, and whose
authority has not been much abated by time, we willingly went back half
a century; but our future citations will be chiefly from writers of the
present generation, which has afforded a greater amount of evidence in
point than can now be gathered from all the generations which preceded
it.

There is no part of Europe in which small landed properties are more
numerous, or in which the country seems more entirely given up to the
peasantry, than the Palatinate of the Rhine; and the thousands of
English travellers who annually traverse it can bear testimony to what
strikes even a casual passer-by—the garden-like cultivation of the
district (as, indeed, of the whole Rhineland), and the marvellous
celerity with which, as soon as one crop is off the ground, it is
ploughed, manured, and another crop put in.2 Two books, published within
the last few years, descriptive of the agriculture of that country, are
now before us. One is Mr. Howitt’s Rural and Domestic Life in Germany.3
Mr. Howitt’s familiarity with, and interest in, rural objects and
pursuits are well known, and he lived for several years at Heidelberg.
The other is a little treatise On the Agriculture of the Palatinate, and
particularly of the Heidelberg District, by Professor Rau, of
Heidelberg, the author of the most elaborate and justly esteemed
systematic treatise on political economy in the German language.4 We
Edition: current; Page: [969] shall present our readers with a few
passages from these writers, commencing with the Englishman.

In Germany, says Mr. Howitt:

The peasants are the great and ever-present objects of country life.
They are the great population of the country, because they themselves
are the possessors. This country is, in fact, for the most part in the
hands of the people. It is parcelled out amongst the multitude. . . .
The peasants are not, as with us, for the most part totally cut off from
property in the soil they cultivate, totally dependent on the labour
afforded by others; they are themselves the proprietors. It is perhaps
from this cause they they are probably the most industrious peasantry in
the world.

[Pp. 40-1.]

Whoever is acquainted with only one region in which there are peasant
proprietors, invariably thinks the peasantry of that particular region
the most industrious in the world:

They labour early and late, because they feel that they are labouring
for themselves. The German peasants work hard, but they have no actual
want. Every man has his house, his orchard, his road-side trees,
commonly so hung with fruit that he is obliged to prop and secure them
all ways, or they would be torn to pieces. He has his corn plot, his
plot for mangel-wurzel, for hemp, and so on. He is his own master; and
he and every member of his family have the strongest motives to labour.
You see the effect of this in that unremitting diligence which is beyond
that of the whole world besides, and his economy, which is still
greater.

[P. 41.]

So it is not industry alone which springs up and flourishes under the
beneficent influence of a permanent interest in the soil; that influence
is no less auspicious to prudence and self-control; for a large measure
and a wide range of those qualities are included in the idea of an
“economy” superior even to that “diligence” which already surpasses that
of “the whole world besides.”

The Germans, indeed, are not so active and lively as the English. You
never seen them in a bustle, or as though they meant to knock-off a vast
deal in a little time. You never witness that scene of stir and hurry
that you often do in England; that shouting to one another and running,
where the need of dispatch rouses all the life and energy of the English
character. They are, on the contrary, slow but for ever doing. They plod
on from day to day and year to year, the most patient, untirable, and
persevering of animals. The English peasant is so cut off from the idea
of property, that he comes habitually to look upon it as a thing from
which he is warned by the laws of the large proprietors, and becomes, in
consequence, spiritless, purposeless, and at once the terror and the
victim of the capitalists. The German bauer, on the contrary, looks on
the country as made for him and his fellow-men. He feels himself a man;
he has a stake in the country, as good as that of the bulk of his
neighbours; he is content with his black bread, because his labour has
at once created it and sweetened it to his taste, and because no man can
threaten him with ejection or the workhouse, as long as he is active and
economical. He walks, therefore, Edition: current; Page: [970] with a
bold step; he looks you in the face with the air of a free man, but of a
respectful one.

[Pp. 41-2.]

This is surely like the traditional, or we should more properly say the
poetical, idea of an English independent yeomanry. Where is this idea
best realized? In Dorsetshire, or on the Rhine?

Of the daily labours of these people the same author thus proceeds:

There is not an hour of the year in which they do not find unceasing
occupation. In the depth of winter, when the weather permits them by any
means to get out of doors, they are always finding something to do. They
carry out their manure to their lands while the frost is in them. If
there is not frost, they are busy cleaning ditches and felling old fruit
trees, or such as do not bear well. Such of them as are too poor to lay
in a sufficient stock of wood, find plenty of work in ascending into the
mountainous woods, and bringing thence fuel. It would astonish the
English common people to see the intense labour with which the Germans
earn their firewood. In the depth of frost and snow, go into any of
their hills and woods, and there you find them hacking up stumps,
cutting off branches, and gathering, by all means which the official
wood police will allow, boughs, stakes, and pieces of wood, which they
convey home with the most incredible toil and patience.

[P. 44.]

And again:

In England, with its great quantity of grass lands and its large farms,
so soon as the grain is in, and the fields are shut up for hay grass,
the country seems in a comparative state of rest and quiet. But here
they are everywhere, and for ever, hoeing and mowing, planting and
cutting, weeding and gathering. They have a succession of crops like a
market gardener. They have their carrots, poppies, hemp, flax,
saintfoin, lucerne, rape, colewort, cabbage, rotabaga, black turnips,
Swedish and white turnips, teazles, Jerusalem artichokes, mangel-wurzel,
parsnips, kidney beans, field beans and peas, vetches, Indian corn,
buckwheat, madder for the manufacturer, potatoes, their great crop of
tobacco, millet—all, or the greater part, under the family management,
in their own family allotments. They have had these things first to sow,
many of them to transplant; to hoe, to weed, to clear off insects, to
top; many of them to mow and gather in successive crops. They have their
water meadows, of which kind almost all their meadows are, to flood, to
mow, and reflood; watercourses to reopen and to make anew; their early
fruits to gather, to bring to market with their green crops of
vegetables; their cattle, sheep, calves, foals, and poultry to look
after; their vines, as they shoot rampantly in the summer heat, to
prune, and thin out the leaves where they are too thick; and any one may
imagine what a scene of incessant labour it is.

[Pp. 50-1.]

How much labour human beings can undergo and find it not a burden, but a
pleasure, is only known where the fruits to be gathered are for
themselves, and the patrimony to be improved their own and their
children’s inheritance. Nor is the labour bestowed unprofitably. Their
tools are imperfect, but industry makes up all deficiencies in the means
and appliances.5 “The peasant harrows and Edition: current; Page: [971]
clears his land till it is in the nicest order, and it is admirable to
see the crops which he obtains.” [P. 27.]

These are not the statements of one who wishes to make out a case
against England, or who is prepossessed in favour of foreign countries
in general, or Germany in particular. It is well known to Mr. Howitt’s
readers that he is as much of a John Bull as is at all reconcileable
with a fair share of modern ideas: his feelings, associations, and
prejudices are wholly English, and his mental character, in all its
elements, of an exclusively English type. In proof whereof, he is as
inveterate as Mr. Baines against the state education and the
ecclesiastical system of the German monarchies, and does not yield to
Mr. Laing in bitterness against the general scheme of German social
institutions, and against many points in the German national character.6
But the admirable effects of peasant properties he could not fail to
appreciate, because his heart is with the people; and because any one
whose sympathies are with them, and not solely with great landlords,
cannot but value and honour a state of society in which they also count
for something; in which those who till and fertilize the earth are not
disinherited of their fair proportion of its surface; in which a manual
labourer is not necessarily a dependent, who “asks his brother of the
earth to give him leave to toil,” but has obtained that leave once for
all from society itself; where the poor, equally with the rich, “walk
with a bold step,” and are free citizens of the world, by a tenure
stronger than that of political institutions—the possession of an
assured means of subsistence, which no man has given, and no man has
power to take away.

In a future article we shall show how the observations and inferences of
the English sojourner concur in their results with the more elaborate
researches and more precise statements of the Heidelberg professor.

335.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [25]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 2 DEC., 1846, P. 4

For the context, see No. 306. This unheaded first leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A twenty fifth leading article on Irish affairs,

(MacMinn, p. 64).

our paper of monday contained a set of resolutions by the guardians of
Kilrush Union, in which the Government is urged to devise and carry into
effect some plan of extensive emigration, as a remedy for Irish evils.1
Kilrush is in the county of Clare, in which one-third of the adult male
population is receiving pauper allowance, under the name of government
employment. No wonder that the guardians should be anxious to rid
themselves of this terrible incubus, which, if it continues a single
year, bids fair to imbue the whole labouring population with the
feelings of sturdy beggars for the remainder of the present generation
at the least. But it is a wonder that people should persist for ever in
looking five thousand miles off for what they have at their doors. The
Kilrush guardians would not send their sheep or their oxen across the
Atlantic to graze, when there is ample pasture on the other side of the
brook. Why is there a different rule for human beings? Why so anxious to
send fellow-creatures out of sight, where their success can be a benefit
to nobody but themselves—where no one can be either taught or inspired
by their example? A large body of the peasantry are to be drafted off
and made comfortable, or put in the way of making themselves so, by
giving them land, we suppose, and tools to cultivate it. Is there any
peculiar propriety in selecting the Antipodes as the scene of this very
simple work of justice and beneficence? Is the light that is to be
kindled one that should be hid under a bushel? Ought it not rather to be
made to shine before men?2

We are as favourable as any one to measures for facilitating emigration.
We think that all persons who desire to remove to the colonies should
have every kind of information given them for their guidance, and every
needless difficulty removed from their path. We would have the system of
landed property and the distribution of population in the colonies so
regulated as to afford the greatest possible field of employment for
emigrant labour. We would give every facility to the formation of a
colonial fund for importing labour from the mother country; and we would
even advance for the purpose, from the national treasury, any sum which
the colonies desired, and could be expected to repay. We would do
everything in aid and support of voluntary emigration: but that which is
now urged upon the Government is compulsory—for what compulsion is
stronger than that in which the alternative is starvation? If nature and
necessity created the Edition: current; Page: [973] alternative we
should have nothing to say. Nature has hard laws. If there was actually
no room for these people in their own country; if at home they must
either starve or be supported by alms, under the frivolous pretence of
work; if Canada or Australia was the nearest place where it was possible
for them to earn a sufficient subsistence by their own labour on land of
their own, we should despise the sentimentality which would bid them
remain, and be paupers and beggars at home, instead of freemen,
citizens, and independent landed proprietors abroad. But they may be all
this at home much better than in Australia or Canada—less expensively to
the State, and more suitably and advantageously to themselves. We have
said it already, and we repeat it—the Celtic Irish are not the best
material to colonize with.3 The English and Scotch are the proper stuff
for the pioneers of the wilderness. The life of a backwoodsman does not
require the social qualities which constitute the superiority of the
Irish; it does require the individual hardihood, resource, and
self-reliance which are precisely what the Irish have not. The first
requisite of a backwoodsman is to be able to stand alone, in all senses,
physical, intellectual, and moral. He must propose for himself, contrive
for himself, execute for himself. He must never need a leader, nor
desire a follower. He must be able to turn his hand to everything, and
adapt himself summarily to all novelties of situation and circumstance.
The Irishman is the opposite of all this. Sympathy and fellowship are
indispensable to him. Instead of insisting, John-Bull-like, upon owing
everything to himself, the demand of his nature is to be led and
governed. He prefers to have some one to lean upon. He has energy and
self-will in abundance, because he has strong desires, but it must be in
the line of his previous habits and inclinations. He will never emerge
from old habits by his own innate force; but he may be guided and
persuaded out of them, as many a priest and many a landlord know; for
nature and circumstances have so formed the Irish character, that while
Irish landlords collectively have been among the worst in Europe, many
individual Irish landlords have succeeded in doing with and for their
peasantry such things as no English landlord ever did or could do. Such
a people are only fit for an old country, and an old country is alone
fit for them. Not to add that it is a questionable thing to take a
people whom five centuries of misrule have made lawless and disorderly,
and plant them down where there cannot possibly be any law or order to
restrain them. Even in the United States the Irish are the most riotous
and unmanageable part of the population. An Irish peasantry have already
graduated but too well in Lynch law.

The fittest place for the Irish peasant is Ireland. It is there that the
greatest number of improving influences can be concentrated upon him.
Landed property there would precisely supply what is wanting to the
formation of his character. What is good for him is that all the
influences of civilization should be preserved Edition: current; Page:
[974] and increased, but that he himself should be gently lifted up and
placed within the pale, insted of being left outside of it. The
possession of property would do this. It would make him an orderly
citizen. It would make him a supporter of the law, instead of a rebel
against all law but that of his confederacy. It would make him
industrious and active, self-helping and self-relying, like his Celtic
brother of France. And it would (if anything would) make him, like the
same Celtic kinsman, frugal, self-restraining, and provident, both in
other things, and in the main article of all, population. These are the
natural effects of property, especially landed property, on those who
have it, and on those also, almost in an equal degree, who hope to
obtain it by exertion and frugality. On our plan every peasant would be
either in the one case or in the other. We cannot make them all
proprietors; perhaps we would not if we could. But all might have the
hope, and, if they chose, the power, of one day becoming so. To remove
the surplus labourers is well, but it is well also to do something
permanently useful to those who cannot be removed. Their wages, it may
be said, would rise. Perhaps they would: undoubtedly so, if the
opportunity were taken to get rid of cottier tenure. But very little
will have been done for them if they merely look upon these higher wages
as convertable into potatoes for a larger number of mouths. The
desideratum is, that along with higher wages they should have placed
before them an object highly desirable to them, and attainable by saving
from their wages. The possession of land would be that object. Of what
use is it to create landed properties in New Zealand for Irish peasants,
if Ireland is to be given up to cottiers, or even to labourers for hire?
Is it so noble a thing, is it an exploit worthy of statesmen and
philanthropists, to nurse and cocker up the Irish peasantry with the
elevated and enviable condition of Dorsetshire labourers? And this
glorious result is the favourite utopianism, the extreme and
impracticable ultimatum, of all plans but those which provide a superior
class of peasantry, maintained by land and not by wages, in Ireland
itself. There is a rather numerous class of regenerators of Ireland who
certainly are no visionaries. The ideal of social perfection to which
they aspire for her is not pitched high.

We have said nothing on this occasion of the expense of the emigration
plan, because enough has been said of it before, and because the thing
really speaks for itself. We formerly estimated the cost of transporting
the people to Canada, and settling them there, at ten times the expense
of locating them on the waste lands.4 Others have since estimated it at
thirty times.5 We know not, nor is it material, which guess is nearest
the truth. Neither have we spoken of the benefit of employing our own
labour in the improvement of our own country, instead of the improvement
of countries which will not always be ours. These considerations
Edition: current; Page: [975] are too obvious to be missed, and too
important to be undervalued. But let the plan once come to maturity; let
its promoters commit themselves to figures and details, and they will
present us with something either on a scale of palpable insufficiency
(however useful in a distant future), or bearing on the face of it so
lavish a waste of public resources, squandered irrecoverably (for
settlers in the wilderness never repay), that no imaginable degree of
profusion on the part of Parliament, profuse as Parliament has of late
years become, could come up to the mark of seriously entertaining so
monstrous a scheme.


336.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [26]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 3 DEC., 1846, P. 4

Here Mill fulfills his promise to discuss Professor Rau’s Ueber die
Landwirthschaft der Rheinpfalz (see No. 334). For the context of the
series, see Nos. 306 and 330. This unheaded first leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A twenty sixth leading article on Irish affairs,
in the Morning Chronicle of 3 Decemb. 1846 (peasant properties)”

(MacMinn, p. 64).

professor rau begins his observations on the agriculture of the
Palatinate by saying that it is

unmistakeably carried on with a high degree of industry and dexterity.
The indefatigableness of the country people, who may be seen in activity
all the day and all the year, and are never idle because they make a
good distribution of their labours, and find for every interval of time
a suitable occupation, is as well known as their zeal is praiseworthy in
turning to use every circumstance which presents itself, in seizing upon
every useful novelty which offers, and even in searching out new and
advantageous methods. One easily perceives that the peasant of this
district has reflected much on his occupation: he can give reasons for
his modes of proceeding, even if those reasons are not always tenable;
he is as exact an observer of proportions as it is possible to be from
memory, without the aid of figures; he attends to such general signs of
the times as appear to him to augur benefit or harm.1

The intelligence and, what is still rarer than intelligence, the
active-mindedness to which this passage bears testimony, it is
impossible to assign to any other cause than the possession of a
property in the soil. A day-labourer who earns his wages by mere
obedience to orders, may become a good artificer in his particular
manual operation, but his mind stagnates. He is not paid for thinking
and contriving, but for executing. He may be a better peg in some vast
machine, though even that is not true in an unqualified sense. But in
sagacity, in thoughtfulness, in power to judge of consequences and
connect means with ends, Edition: current; Page: [976] in all which
constitutes the practical talent of a human being, in every intellectual
faculty which it ought to be the object of popular education to cherish
and improve, which of these men is likely to bear off the palm—the one
who drudges through a stated task for daily wages, or the one whose task
is the agreeable one of finding every way of improving and making
valuable a small farm, of which the whole produce is his own, and which
is the permanent inheritance of his children?

The agriculture of this interesting country is not only good, but
steadily progressive. The introduction of liquid manure is ascribed to
David Mollinger, of Monsheim, near Worms, who died in 1787;2 its
employment is now elaborate and systematic. As in Belgium, Switzerland,
and Tuscany, so here, an excellent rotation of crops has been long known
and practised; but this also is continually undergoing improvement.
Stephen Gugenmus, of Handschuhsheim, near Heidelberg, who died in 1778,
in his thirty-eighth year, is considered the chief author of the clover
and madder cultivation.3 The improvements in the culture of tobacco, a
staple product of the district, took place mostly between 1770 and 1780.
When Rau published his book (in 1830) old men were living who remembered
a time when there was little lucerne and no beetroot, when the cattle
were not stall-fed, and when the manure, now so carefully preserved, was
mostly wasted. Green manure was first brought into frequent use in the
present century; and the vine cultivation, long neglected in this
district, commenced a course of improvement in the ten years previous to
1830.4

As agriculture improved, so also did the condition of the people. Of
this there can be no better criterion than the daily wages of that part
of the agricultural population who have no land, or not enough to occupy
their whole time. During the last years of the war, wages, according to
Professor Rau, had been unusually high; they continued so until 1817.5
From that time they settled down to a lower rate; but the prices of many
commodities having fallen in a still greater proportion, the condition
of the labouring people was unequivocally improved. The improvement in
their diet is not a matter of surmise, but of ascertained fact. In this
district it is still the custom for hired labourers to be fed by their
employers; and, according to Rau, there is a most decided improvement in
the food afforded to them. “Forty years ago the farm servants had no
cheese with their bread, and a smaller quantity of flesh-meat and
puddings” (Mehlspeisen).6 We may here remark, that there is no one point
more unanimously testified to by Edition: current; Page: [977] accurate
describers of the condition of the country people in the parts of Europe
which possess a peasant proprietary, than the occurrence, since the last
generation, of a great improvement in the quality of their habitual
food. We insist on this point, because it is so much the practice of
English observers to judge of the condition of the people by this single
test. How many are the travellers who, in rapidly running across the
Continent, have pronounced the labouring population to be ill paid and
miserable, in comparison with the English, on no better or other
evidence than the colour of their bread! For our part, we make little
account of such a criterion. The prejudice of English workpeople in
favour of white bread is a kind of local superstition, grounded, like
most of their preferences in diet, chiefly upon superior costliness. Nor
in any case is expensive food the favourite luxury of the continental
peasantry. The thing which most strikes the observer on this subject is,
how much they can do with small means and inexpensive materials. The
peasant of the Continent, when he has anything to spare, usually prefers
to lay it by for the purpose of buying more land, rather than expend it
in what an Englishman would consider (though he probably does not) an
improvement in his mode of living. But though we ought to be cautious of
inferring poverty from what an English labourer looks upon as
inferiority of diet, yet for that very reason the substitution of more
costly food is a most decisive evidence of general improvement; and
there is ample proof that over a large portion of the Continent this
substitution is now actually taking place.

“Such an increase of wages,” says Professor Rau, “which must be
estimated not in money, but in the quantity of necessaries and
conveniences which the labourer is enabled to procure, is by universal
admission a proof that the mass of capital must have increased.”7 It is
so; but it also proves something more. It proves, not only that capital
has increased, but that the increase of the labouring population has
been in a less rapid ratio. It proves that the possibility, opened to
every labourer who can save money, of becoming a landed proprietor is
more than an incentive to industry; that it is also a check to
over-population, by affording a motive which pervades the whole people
for the restriction of expenditure, as well as for the increase of
production; a motive to practice, along with other kinds of economy,
that which is of all kinds the most important—economy of mouths. It
warrants a hope that this blessing, if extended to Ireland, would be not
merely a sovereign remedy for Irish listlessness and indolence, but
would do much to correct the still deeper seated and more intractable
malady of Irish improvidence.

337.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [27]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 7 DEC., 1846, P. 4

For the context, see No. 306. This unheaded first leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A twenty seventh leading article on Irish
affairs, in the Morning Chronicle of 7th December 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 64).

the returns in our Saturday’s paper of the number of persons receiving
relief from the Irish Government in the form of public employment, and
the weekly expense of that relief, are calculated to inspire serious
thoughts in the most reckless promoter of an extended poor-law for
Ireland.1

Three hundred thousand able-bodied Irishmen now receive wages, and what
is called employment, from a public authority; and the expenditure for
the purpose has nearly reached half a million per month. It is difficult
to imagine how under such circumstances it could be less. Eight months
have to elapse before the next harvest; whatever may be the distress
now, it must become greater during all that time, and if the distress
did not, the clamour for assistance undoubtedly would. Four millions
therefore are the smallest outlay we have still to look forward to, in
addition to the whole of what has already been expended. But great as is
the present amount, it is a less alarming symptom than the rapidly
progressive increase, and even that is less formidable than the effects
already produced on the minds and conduct of the labouring class. The
bitterest enemy of a poor law with out-door relief could hardly have
anticipated so instantaneous and rank a luxuriance of every form of
demoralization which could have been expected from the worst permanent
poor-law ever proposed. The whole Irish people are rushing with one
impulse to fasten themselves upon the taxes. No one will consent to
work, except for Government wages. No wonder—they are higher than any
other description of wages, and the work well known to be nominal. The
small farmers, though they pay no rent, do not even sow their lands. A
few days ago we quoted the assertion from a Kerry paper, that the county
en masse had discontinued agricultural operations.2 What need that any
one should provide food for himself? The Government is to feed
everybody.

We should like to know in what manner this initiatory specimen of what
is to be expected from the proposed Irish poor-law can be explained away
by its promoters. The system now in temporary operation differs in no
material feature Edition: current; Page: [979] from what they desire to
introduce into the permanent institutions of the country. Whatever
difference there may be is to the advantage of the temporary system.
They demand a law which shall guarantee wages and out-door employment to
all the destitute. The present arrangement only differs from this in
holding out, not the certainty, but only the hope of wages and
employment. If the mere hope has the effects we now see, what may we not
expect from the certainty? There is another difference: the poor-law
project would lay the obligation of finding wages and employment upon
each parish in Ireland; the present arrangements impose the burthen upon
each barony. We know not what inexplicable idea haunts some people, of a
wonderful difference in efficacy between these two words; but “parish”
will raise a spirit as soon as “barony,” and every day’s experience is
giving additional means of judging what sort of spirit it will be.

The present moment is, without exaggeration, the most critical in the
history of England’s dealings with Ireland. The whole fruits of
centuries of oppression and neglect are coming home to us in a single
year. The entire population of the country are coming upon us to be fed.
And we are called upon to decide instantaneously whether we will or will
not undertake the office. There is no retreating, no putting off. The
burden of Irish destitution is now to be borne by us. Ireland can no
longer suffer alone. We must take our full share of the evil, or put an
end to it. For a few weeks or months longer we have the choice which.
Wait a year, and we may have it no longer. Wait a year, and the mind of
the Irish population may be so thoroughly pauperised, that to be
supported by other people may be the only mode of existence they will
consent to. There may be a Jacquerie, or another ninety-eight, in
defence of the rights of sturdy beggary. It may require a hundred
thousand armed men to make the Irish people submit to the common destiny
of working in order to live.

Under such a mass of impending evil it is no longer enough not to make
the eleemosynary system permanent. That system must be promptly put an
end to. We must give over telling the Irish that it is our business to
find food for them. We must tell them, now and for ever, that it is
their business. We must tell them that to find or make employment as an
excuse for feeding those who have a head to seek for work and hands to
do it, is a thing they are not to expect either from the Government, or
from the barony, or from the parish. They have a right, not to support
at the public cost, but to aid and furtherance in finding support for
themselves. They have a right to a repeal of all laws and a reform of
all social systems which improperly impede them in finding it, and they
have a right to their fair share of the raw material of the earth. They
have a right to that part of the earth’s surface which is as much theirs
as any man’s, since no man made it,3 and no man has ever used or
improved it. Millions of acres are lying waste, Edition: current; Page:
[980] requiring little more than labour to render them productive, and
to avoid giving these acres to the destitute, we are giving them,
instead, many millions of pounds sterling. We are paying gold with both
hands to destroy such industry, independence, and self-reliance as they
already have, and we withhold what would cost us little or nothing, and
would be to them the fountain spring of those virtues for all time to
come.

We have read with ineffable disgust the statement made by that highly
respectable paper, the Dublin Evening Post, of its reason for not having
yet advocated the location of the peasantry as proprietors on the waste
lands.4 It classes the scheme with that of an extended poor-law, as two
things on which it has not declared itself, because it sees almost
insuperable difficulties in the way of both. Those of the poor-law we
need not recapitulate; those of the waste lands consist in the almost
insurmountable aversion which, the Post says, it cannot disguise from
itself the existence of, as to any project for giving up those lands to
a peasant proprietary. We look upon this simple assertion as equivalent
to the most bitter of the denunciations of which the Irish landlords
complain that they are so often the objects from this side of St.
George’s Channel. And these dogs in the manger, who will neither use the
land nor let others use it, expect sympathy and money from England! And
one of them at a public meeting dared to invoke the precedent of the
twenty millions which the nation cheerfully paid for the freedom of the
negro!5 As much and more would it pay, and pay gladly, for the freedom
and comfort of the worse than serf, the Irish cottier. But its gifts are
not for the serf’s master. It did not pay twenty millions to the
slaveowner and leave the slaves no better than they were before. And we
are much mistaken if it will go on long paying half a million a month
without insisting on having full value for the money, in the shape of a
permanent improvement in the industrial and economical system of
Ireland.


338.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [28]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 8 DEC., 1846, P. 4

Mill here comments on yet another waste-land reclamation scheme, that
advanced by William Smith O’Brien (1803-64), Protestant Irish
nationalist and M.P. for Limerick since 1835, in “The Landed Proprietors
of Ireland. Letter III. Drainage and Reclamation of Lands,” Morning
Chronicle, 7 Dec., p. 7, from which Mill’s quotations are taken. For the
context of the series, see No. 306. This unheaded first leader is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “A twenty eighth leading article on
Irish affairs, in the Morning Chronicle of 8th December 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 64).

Edition: current; Page: [981]
in a letter to the landed proprietors of Ireland, which we extracted in
Monday’s paper, Mr. Smith O’Brien has at length entered at large upon
the subject of waste lands and peasant proprietors. We are glad to be
able to say that his opinions and propositions on the subject are just
and rational, and we congratulate the good cause on having acquired, in
his person, another and no contemptible champion in Parliament.

There are points in Mr. O’Brien’s letter which would afford food for
criticism if we were disposed at the present moment to indulge in it. In
the double capacity of Irish landlord and Irish Repealer, he gives way
to some vagaries of sentiment for which we shall not dispute his claim
to be excused. He talks of the “ribald vituperation now daily poured
forth against the landlords and people of this country by the most
influential portion of the English press.” No one, that we know of, is
vituperating the Irish people. Mr. Foster’s crotchets about the
inferiority of the Celtic race are the last thing we have seen, in any
influential journal, which even prejudice could select to hang that
imputation upon.1 The landlords indeed have lately been receiving part
of their deserts, and high time was it that they should, when they were
stretching out their hands as “importunate mendicants” (we thank Mr.
O’Brien for the word), expecting that as usual the alms designed for the
peasantry would be dispensed to them, and this time by millions instead
of thousands of pounds, and, as far as the uninitiated could perceive,
with as much probability as ever of having their expectation realised.
It was altogether natural that the “most influential portion” of the
English journals, whatever other measures they recommended, should
protest with one voice against so scandalous an abuse. England will
grudge nothing for the relief of the Irish peasantry; she grudges, and
ought to grudge, everything to the landlords. Respecting the measures
best adapted to raise the condition of the Irish people there are
various opinions, but on this point we believe, on our side of the
Channel, there is but one—that whatever is done shall be done for the
people, and for the people directly, passing over the landlords.

We forgive Mr. O’Brien for asserting that Ireland (which in this case
means the landlords) has a “national claim” to an indefinite drain on
the resources of the empire for the relief of poverty which was caused
or which might have been prevented by themselves. For while Mr. O’Brien
pays this tribute to landlordism, he exhorts the landlords to find a
better resource in emergency than this imaginary privilege. He bids them
“approach the Legislature with the dignity of men who are themselves
prepared to shrink from no sacrifices which can justly be exacted from
them, rather than as supplicants endeavouring to wring from the relucant
hand of a taskmaster some wretched pittance of eleemosynary relief.” We
can pardon much false theory for such a practical corollary. He then
says that the landlords have submitted to have imposed on them, by the
Legislature, the burden of providing for the subsistence of those who
are now suffering; and that, Edition: current; Page: [982] this duty
having been accomplished, “we” (the landlords) “owe not only to
ourselves, but also to every other class of our fellow-countrymen, the
obligation of providing an immediate escape from the universal pauperism
which the system at present in operation cannot fail ultimately to
produce.” Rem acu tetigit:2 this is the very thing which required to be
said. We hope that the landlords will listen to the friendly voice of a
brother landlord, if that of the vituperative English press is too rough
for them, and that they will avert the imminent danger of having the
whole people converted into parish paupers, in the only way in which
that danger can be repelled, by converting them into something better.

Mr. O’Brien’s remedial measures partly consist in things to be done by
individual landlords on their estates, for which purpose he would have
money advanced to them on terminable annuities by the Government; and
partly in a general measure for reclaiming waste lands, and covering
them with a peasant proprietary.

Allowing twenty acres to each farm, a million of acres would suffice for
the creation of fifty thousand farms, which would give direct employment
to as many families, and would indirectly afford a livelihood to nearly
the same number. It is not too much to say that from 300,000 to 500,000
persons might be advantageously located upon the unreclaimed soil of
Ireland.

Even fifty thousand families of peasant proprietors would be an
invaluable element to introduce into the population of such a country,
and would be a great draft from the overcrowded cottier tenantry. But
twenty acres to each farm, except where the land is very bad, is an
unnecessary allotment, and for the sake of accommodating a greater
number we should generally be satisfied with ten.

“As there is no land absolutely vacant” (Mr. O’Brien continues), “some
difficulty would arise in dealing with tenants at present in occupation,
as well as with the proprietors.” Tenants of uncultivated land can have
rented only the natural pasture, which is seldom of any material value,
or else the right of cutting turf for fuel. Compensation for these
rights would be as easily awarded to tenants as to landlords. “I am
persuaded, however, that if legal facilities were afforded for the
alienation of property of this description, and if liberal terms were
offered by way of compensation, both to tenants and landlords, large
tracts could be purchased on terms of voluntary sale.” Mr. O’Brien,
however, supports the proposal for assuming a power of compulsory
purchase. He takes a more sanguine view of the reception of this project
by Irish landlords than the Dublin Evening Post,3 and we sincerely hope
he will prove the truer prophet. He is Edition: current; Page: [983]
“inclined to hope that little difficulty would be raised on the part of
Irish proprietors. The substantial impediment to the proposal will be
the reluctance of Parliament to apply to such an object the requisite
amount of capital.”

On this last point Mr. O’Brien has something further to say, and so have
we. “It is useless,” he says,

to mislead the public by fallacious calculations. I fear that we could
not estimate the amount of money required to purchase the soil, to build
houses, and to reclaim as much of the land as would be necessary in
order to give subsistence to the settlers during the first year, at much
less than £10 per acre. An Irish member who should propose to apply ten
millions of money to the reclamation of land in Ireland, would be
laughed to scorn in the British Legislature.

Now, in the first place, we believe that Mr. O’Brien considerably
overrates the amount of advance which would be required. He probably
contemplates the payment to the owners of the land of a much larger
compensation than we should consider due to them for what they have
never used, and are not able to use; and he includes in his estimate the
expense of building houses, which, as we have said more than once, we
would for all reasons, and not for reasons of expense merely, leave the
settlers to do for themselves and in their own way.4 But if it did
require ten millions, or much more than ten millions, we are convinced
that Mr. O’Brien does injustice to England and the English Parliament in
supposing that there would be the least difficulty to a Ministry in
obtaining that sum, even if it were not, as it would be, a mere loan at
interest, with good landed security for repayment in full within a small
number of years. Let a well-concocted plan be laid before Parliament,
and due provision made against misapplication of the money, and we
question if there would be twenty English members who would vote against
the plan when brought forward by a Ministry. Mr. O’Brien, not being “so
weak as to believe that this operation will be undertaken as a
benevolent project by our prudent neighbours,” suggests to the
landlords, “If you consent to take all the risk of the experiment upon
yourselves—if you will mortgage your estates, and pledge your county
rates as a collateral security, it is possible that you will be
permitted to make the experiment by means of a loan from the Imperial
Treasury.” Our notion of what it is “weak to believe” differs little
from that of Mr. O’Brien, and if the adoption of the plan rested upon
the chance of their closing with this suggestion of his, we should
indeed tremble for it. The English Parliament will hearken to Mr.
O’Brien’s recommendations much sooner than, we fear, the Irish landlords
will; and if he finds ten to join him in the chivalrous undertaking
which he proposes, for the sake of those ten righteous men we could
almost consent to be reconciled to the entire class.

339.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [29]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 9 DEC., 1846, P. 4

This continuation of the evidence in favour of peasant proprietors draws
on Switzerland, the South of France, and the Pyrenees, in 1830, 2 vols.
(Edinburgh: Constable, 1831), by Henry David Inglis (1795-1835), a
writer of books on travel, whose pseudonym was “Derwent Conway.” For the
context, see Nos. 306 and 330. This unheaded first leader is described
in Mill’s bibliography as “A twenty ninth leading article on Irish
affairs, in the Morning Chronicle of 9th Decemb. 1846 (peasant
proprietors.)”

(MacMinn, p. 64.)

the classic ground of peasant proprietors, next to Norway, is
Switzerland. Of all countries in Europe, Norway excepted, it is probably
in Switzerland that peasant properties, as a general feature of the
country, are of longest standing, and have most fully produced their
natural effects. The reduction of Switzerland to the condition of a
“pauper-warren”1 ought, therefore, if there was truth in the current
maxims of English political economy a generation ago, to have reached a
most advanced stage, or rather to be entirely consummated.

“Throughout the cantons of Basle and Argovie,” says Mr. Inglis,

farming out land is unknown, with the exception of gardens near the
large towns. The properties of those who are considered respectable
Swiss peasants run from 10 up to 40, or at most 50 acres; many of the
peasants have amassed considerable fortunes; but accession of fortune is
never made apparent in their mode of living.

[Vol. I, pp. 25-6.]

This we believe to be the general rule throughout the Continent. Nowhere
in continental countries will there be found an entire people, from
nearly the lowest up to nearly the highest, absorbed in the mean
ambition of pushing themselves, by dint of expense, from the class in
which they were born into a richer or finer class, or of maintaining, by
apparent expense, the false semblance of a larger income than they
really have. “From £100 to £300 per annum is the usual range of
expenditure for persons living, as we should say, in easy circumstances;
and I learned, from authority that admits of no doubt, that not a single
individual in all Switzerland spends £1,000 per annum.” [Ibid., p. 26.]

Let us see how this traveller, who stands so high in the reputed
correctness of his observations and precision of his information, was
impressed by the signs of industry among the Swiss people:

In walking anywhere in the neighbourhood of Zurich, in looking to the
right or to the left, one is struck with the extraordinary industry of
the inhabitants; and if we learn that a proprietor here has a return of
ten per cent., we are inclined to say, “He deserves it.” I speak at
present of country labour, though I believe that, in every kind of trade
also, the people of Zurich are remarkable for their assiduity; but in
the industry they show in the cultivation of their land I may safely say
they are unrivalled.

[Ibid., p. 32.]

Edition: current; Page: [985]
Exactly what Mr. Howitt said of the peasant proprietors of Germany, and
almost exactly what Arthur Young said of such peasant proprietors as
even at the time of his travels were already found in France.2

When I used to open my casement between four and five in the morning to
look out upon the lake and the distant Alps, I saw the labourer in the
fields; and when I returned from an evening walk, long after sunset, as
late, perhaps, as half-past eight, there was the labourer, mowing his
grass, or tying up his vines. But there are other and better evidences
of the industry of the Zurichers than merely seeing them late and early
at work. It is impossible to look at a field, a garden, a hedging,
scarcely even a tree, a flower, or a vegetable, without perceiving
proofs of the extreme care and industry that are bestowed upon the
cultivation of the soil. If, for example, a path leads through, or by
the side of a field of grain, the corn is not, as in England, permitted
to hang over the path, exposed to be pulled or trodden down by every
passer by; it is everywhere bounded by a fence, stakes are placed at
intervals of about a yard, and, about two and four feet from the ground,
boughs of trees are passed longitudinally along. If you look into a
field towards evening, where there are large beds of cauliflower or
cabbage, you will find that every single plant has been watered. In the
gardens, which around Zurich are extremely large, the most punctilious
care is evinced in every production that grows. The vegetables are
planted with seemingly mathematical accuracy; not a single weed is to be
seen, nor a single stone. Plants are not earthed up as with us, but are
planted in a small hollow, into each of which a little manure is put,
and each plant is watered daily. Where seeds are sown, the earth
directly above is broken into the finest powder; every shrub, every
flower is tied to a stake, and where there is wall-fruit a trellice is
erected against the wall, to which the boughs are fastened, and there is
not a single twig that has not its appropriate resting place.

[Inglis, Vol. I, pp. 32-3.]

We make no apology for these minute details. It is the details that make
up the picture. Such traits of unwearied assiduity, and what may almost
be called affectionate interest in the land, form the staple of all
descriptions of the agriculture of peasant proprietors, wherever the
properties are not too small to give full occupation to a family, and
for the most part even where they are so.

Of another more remote and Alpine district of Switzerland Mr. Inglis
thus speaks:

In no country in Europe will be found so few poor as the Engadine. In
the village of Suss, which contains about 600 inhabitants, there is not
a single individual who has not wherewithal to live comfortably, not a
single individual who is indebted to others for one morsel that he eats.
. . . In the whole of the Engadine the land belongs to the peasantry,
who, like the inhabitants of every other place where this state of
things exists, vary greatly in the extent of their possessions. If a
peasant owns from eight to fifteen cows, and land sufficient for their
support, as well as for growing what is consumed in his own family, he
is esteemed in good circumstances. . . . Generally speaking, an Engadine
peasant lives entirely upon the produce of his land, with the exception
of the few articles of foreign growth required in his family, such as
coffee, sugar, and wine. . . . Flax is grown, prepared, spun, and woven
without ever leaving his house. He has also his own wool, Edition:
current; Page: [986] which is converted into a blue coat without passing
through the hands of either the dyer or the tailor. The country is
incapable of greater cultivation than it has received. All has been done
for it that industry and an extreme love of gain can devise. Wherever an
ear of rye will ripen, there it is to be found. There is not a foot of
waste land in the Engadine, the lowest part of which is not much lower
than the top of Snowdon. Wherever grass will grow, there it is; wherever
a rock will bear a blade, verdure is seen upon it; wherever rye will
succeed, there it is cultivated. Barley and oats have also their
appropriate spots; and wherever it is possible to ripen a little patch
of wheat, the cultivation of it is attempted.

[Ibid., pp. 109-11, 113, 146.]

Mr. Inglis, however, does not find that a similar spirit of intense
industry pervades all Switzerland. Like other travellers, he finds a
considerable difference between the Protestant and Catholic cantons, to
the disadvantage of the last. Even Fribourg, though rich, “might be
richer; the people are comfortable, but they might be affluent;” [ibid.,
p. 257] and the inferiority of the Forest cantons is yet more decided,
although peasant properties are as much the general rule in Catholic as
in Protestant Switzerland. Mr. Inglis, however, assigns a cause adequate
to account for the difference, in the great amount of time subtracted
from industry by ceremonial observances. Not only are holidays numerous,
but in many of the Catholic districts several hours of every day are
devoted to religious purposes:

The strict Catholic, who happens to reside within a jurisdiction where
great encouragement is given to the frequency and prolongation of
prayers and ceremonials, spends in church those morning hours which an
English labourer spends in the fields. The daily custom in many of the
Catholic jurisdictions is to spend the morning from six to eight in
church. Nor is it only the morning hours that are lost to labour. At two
in the afternoon the strict Catholic of Uri and elsewhere must again
throw off his labourer’s apparel, put on his best clothes, and repair to
church. . . . If we allow, as an average, twelve hours for labour, and
say that four hours are occupied in the manner I have mentioned—and this
is the very least that can be allowed—one-third more labour is bestowed
upon the land belonging to the Protestants than that belonging to
Catholics; and if to these hours we add twenty-two holidays,

it is easy to understand why in a Lucerne village, divided between the
two religions, Mr. Inglis “remarked the most luxuriant crops, and the
most neglected land, side by side.” [Ibid., pp. 161, 160, 161, 191,
190.]

The Irish peasant, like him of Uri, is a strict Catholic; but the
Catholic religion manifests itself to him in no such forms. It is well
known that the holidays of obligation prescribed for these islands by
the Church of Rome are unusually few, and that any such daily waste of
time as that commemorated by Mr. Inglis is unknown.

We would on no account, in the smallest atom, overstate our case, and we
willingly admit that Mr. Inglis also speaks in high terms of the great
industry of the Bernese peasantry, and of the easy and comfortable
condition in which they live; although in Berne the peasant is not
generally the owner of the soil, great part of it belonging to large
proprietors, and being cultivated by hired servants. Edition: current;
Page: [987] [Ibid., p. 212.] But, in the first place, we never pretended
that a country could not enjoy in an eminent degree the moral and
economical benefits of peasant properties unless every peasant, without
exception, was a proprietor. All the more opulent cantons of German
Switzerland are virtually one country; in some parts nearly half the
labouring population are citizens of other cantons; and the hired
labourer of Berne must, in a great degree, mould his habits and regulate
his requirements on the standard set by the peasant properties in the
surrounding cantons.

But, in the second place, notwithstanding what is said of the industry
and comfortable condition of the Bernese labourer, there is a difference
between that canton and the rest of Switzerland of the most disastrous
kind, namely, that it contains more paupers than are probably to be
found in all the other cantons put together. In 1828 nearly 20,000
persons were receiving public relief, while the population of the canton
(exclusive of the Jura district, to which the poor law does not extend)
amounted, in 1831, to only 313,000, so that more than one person in
every sixteen was an actual pauper. [Ibid., p. 223.] The same canton
which comprises the greatest landowners in Switzerland contains nearly
all its pauperism. We have no intention of laying any stress on this
coincidence, or arguing from it that great landed properties have a
necessary tendency to impoverish the labouring class. The pauperism in
Berne was not owing to the state of its landed property, but to a system
of poor-law administration the worst in Europe, with the single
exception of England previous to the new poor law. Of this system a full
account, communicated by the Bernese Government, is in the Appendix to
the Report of the Poor-law Inquiry Commission.3 In no country but
England was relief so lavishly given, and in no other country therefore
had so much progress been made in pauperizing the population. But while
it would be unfair to ascribe to any other cause the natural and
necessary effects of so bad a poor law, we need not restrain ourselves
from the surmise, that if peasant properties had been as largely
diffused in Berne as they were in Zurich or Aargau, the people would
have been, as they were in those cantons, too manifestly prosperous to
have given occasion or temptation to a profuse system of public relief;
and thus perhaps even the evils of which no other immediate cause needs
be assigned than the poor law, are among the effects for which Berne may
ultimately thank her large properties and her cultivation by hired
labour.

We have quoted thus largely from Mr. Inglis, because he is an
established authority, and because we well know the superior effect, on
English readers, of English testimony. But we have ample evidence to the
same and to many kindred points from foreign sources, more intrinsically
valuable than the passing observations of even the most intelligent
traveller; and some portion of this we may impart to our readers in a
future article.

340.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [30]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 11 DEC., 1846, P. 4

This article carries out the promise at the end of No. 339 by citing the
testimony of Sismondi, thus concluding the series of citations begun in
No. 330. For the context of the series, see No. 306. This unheaded first
leader is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A thirtieth leading
article on Irish affairs, in the Morning Chronicle of 11th December 1846
(peasant proprietors)”

(MacMinn, p. 65).

in a late article we quoted, from one of the writings of Mr. Inglis, a
traveller’s impression of the careful agriculture of Switzerland, and
the exemplary industry of the Swiss peasant proprietors. We shall now
cite the testimony of an inhabitant of the country, and owner of landed
property in it, who was also one of the most instructed and accomplished
political writers of the Continent, and of all political economists the
one who had most studied the economical history of nations, and had the
greatest practical acquaintance with agriculture. We need hardly say
that we mean M. de Sismondi. In his Studies in Political Economy, the
production of his mature years, a book which merits and would well
reward the labour of a translator, this eminent writer thus expresses
himself:

It is especially Switzerland that ought to be surveyed and studied, in
order to judge of the happiness of peasant proprietors. It is
Switzerland that we should learn to know, in order to be convinced that
agriculture, practised by the same persons who receive its fruits, can
create great ease and comfort to a very numerous population; great
independence of character, the result of independence of condition; a
great commerce of consumption, arising from the real affluence of all
the inhabitants, even in a country of which the climate is rude, the
soil of only middling fertility, and where late frosts and inconstancy
of seasons often disappoint the hopes of the agriculturist. It is
impossible to see without admiration those wooden mansions of the
humblest peasant, so large, so perfectly closed in, so well constructed,
so loaded with carvings. In the interior large corridors separate the
numerous chambers of the family; each chamber has but one bed,
abundantly provided with curtains, coverlets, and the whitest linen, and
surrounded by well-kept articles of furniture; the armoires are filled
with linen, the dairy is large, airy, and of exquisite cleanness; under
the same roof is found a great provision of corn, salted meat, cheese,
and wood: in the cow-houses may be seen the most carefully tended and
finest cattle in Europe; the garden is planted with flowers; both men
and women are warmly and cleanly dressed, the latter preserving with
pride their ancient costume, and all wearing in their faces the impress
of health and vigour. Let other nations vaunt their opulence,
Switzerland can always, with pride, oppose to them her peasantry.1

And in another work of the same writer, the New Principles of Political
Economy, he observes:

When traversing nearly all Switzerland, and several provinces of France,
Italy, and Edition: current; Page: [989] Germany, we have no need to
ask, in passing each piece of land, if it belongs to a
proprietor-cultivator or to a farmer. The intelligent care, the
enjoyments prepared for the labourer, the adornment which the country
has received from his hands, very soon point out the former. It is true
that an oppressive government may destroy the comfort and brutalise the
intelligence which ought to be the consequences of property; taxation
may carry off the best part of the produce of the fields, the insolence
of the agents of Government may disturb the security of the peasants,
the impossibility of obtaining justice against a powerful neighbour may
paralyse their minds by discouragement, and in the fine country lately
restored to the administration of the King of Sardinia, the proprietor,
no less than the day labourer, wears the uniform of indigence.2

He is here speaking of Savoy, which is a country of peasant proprietors,
and one of the few countries possessing that advantage in which the
peasantry are very poor and live wretchedly. “It is in vain,” says M. de
Sismondi, “to observe only one of the rules of a sound political
economy, it cannot suffice by itself to produce good; but at least it
diminishes the evil.”3

M. de Sismondi’s evidence in favour of peasant properties is the more
valuable, because he is not one of those superficial and sentimental
people who think it fine, or peradventure pious, to deny or explain away
the penalties which nature has annexed to the unrestrained exercise of
the power of increase inherent in the human species. There is not a
firmer adherent of the doctrines of Malthus, or rather of common sense,
than M. de Sismondi; as, within our experience at least, those who are
really in earnest about the improvement and dignity of the labouring
classes usually are. And when people are besotted enough to taunt a
doctrine which simply declares the actual course of nature, with being
the offspring of inhumanity and of an exclusive regard for wealth, it is
a sufficient answer to oppose to them the man known to Europe as the
proclaimed antagonist of all systems which treat wealth and production,
and not human happiness and human improvement, as the ends of political
economy. But (not to digress further) when small landed properties have
been condemned by some English political economists, it has been chiefly
on the ground that they promote over-population, and, by a too minute
subdivision of the soil, convert the country into a “pauper-warren.”4
Now, that over-population may coexist with peasant properties we by no
means deny; they are not, nor is anything, an absolute safeguard against
that evil. But if their general tendency had been to promote it, the
tendency could not, with his very varied opportunities, have escaped an
observer so keenly alive to the mischiefs of over-population as
Sismondi; and Edition: current; Page: [990] would have been utterly
incompatible with his strenuous advocacy of the system. Let us hear what
he says on the very point:

In countries occupied in the patriarchal manner by small proprietors,
population increases regularly and rapidly, until it has reached its
natural limits; that is to say, inheritances continue to be divided and
subdivided among several children, as long as by an additional
application of labour each family can obtain an undiminished income from
a smaller portion of land. The father who possessed a large extent of
pasturage, divides it among his sons, who convert it into fields and
meadows; these sons further subdivide it, to get rid of the system of
fallows; every advance in agricultural knowledge permits a further
division; but we need not fear that the proprietor will bring up
children to make beggars of them. He knows exactly the inheritance which
he is able to leave them; he knows that the law will divide it equally
among them; he sees the limit at which this division would make them
descend from the rank which he has himself occupied, and a legitimate
family pride, no less real in the peasant than in the nobleman, makes
him pause before calling into existence children whom he will be unable
to provide for. If, notwithstanding, they are born, at least they do not
marry, or they themselves select, among several brothers, the one who
shall perpetuate the family. In the Swiss cantons we never find the
patrimonies of the peasants subdivided to such a degree as to sink them
below a state of honourable comfort, although the habit of foreign
service, by opening to the young a career of undefined possibilities,
gives some encouragement to a superabundant population.5

We will not close our article without a further extract, to complete the
exhibition of the author’s judgment on peasant properties:

The peasant proprietor is, of all cultivators, the one who turns the
soil to greatest account, because he is the one who thinks most of the
future, and who is, besides, the most enlightened by experience. He is
also the one who makes the most advantageous use of human labour,
because, in distributing occupations among all the members of his
family, he reserves employment for every day in the year, so that no one
needs ever be idle. . . . He turns to the benefit of his children, and
of the ages to come, every instant not required of him by the
occupations of the seasons. A few moments are enough for planting the
seed which, in a hundred years, will be a noble tree; for digging the
trench which will permanently drain his field; for forming the conduit
which will guide to it a rivulet of fresh water; for improving by cares
often repeated, but in moments which would otherwise be wasted, all the
different animals and vegetables by which he is surrounded. His little
patrimony is a real bank for savings, ever ready to receive his small
gains, to make profitable all his moments of leisure. The peasant has a
lively feeling of the advantages enjoyed by a proprietor, and is always
eager to buy land at any price. He pays more for it than it is worth,
more than it will perhaps return to him; but how great reason has he to
esteem highly the benefit of having always at hand an advantageous
investment for his labour, without offering it by competition, and being
always sure of bread when he wants it, without having to bid for it in
the market! . . . Of all cultivators he is the most happy; and, in
addition to this, never does the earth maintain in comfort, without
exhausting its power, and provide with employment so many inhabitants on
a given space, as when they are proprietors; and of all cultivators, the
peasant proprietor gives most encouragement to commerce and
manufactures, because of all cultivators he is the richest.6

Such is the deliberate opinion of one of the highest modern authorities
in agricultural economy on the industrial, moral, and social effects of
peasant properties.


341.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [31]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 12 DEC., 1846, P. 4

Mill here continues his controversy with Scrope (see No. 316), answering
Scrope’s letter to the editor (9 Dec., 1846), Morning Chronicle, 11
Dec., p. 6, from which the quotations are taken. For the context of the
series, see No. 306. This unheaded first leader is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “A thirty first leading article on Irish affairs, in the
Morning Chronicle of 12th December 1846 (peasant proprietors)”

(MacMinn, p. 65).

in a letter which we have published, Mr. Poulett Scrope takes up what he
calls our challenge to the advocates of his Irish Poor-law, “to show in
what particular it differs from the wasteful system of public employment
at present carried on under the Labour-rate Act.”1

It is really a pleasure, and one to which we have not been much
accustomed, to find anybody on Mr. Scrope’s side of the question who
condescends to argue, or to reply to arguments. Gentlemen of that way of
thinking, when they see a fact or a piece of obvious truth standing
across their path, seldom do it the honour of attempting to move it
away. They give the go-by to it; they sneak past it, and leave it behind
them, affecting not to see it; and look big when it is fairly out of
sight. We expected better from Mr. Scrope; nor are we disappointed. With
him it is at least a contest of reason against reason. One who attempts
to parry argument, shows himself not invulnerable to it. If he is wrong,
there is always hope of setting him right.

First, however, we must repel from ourselves Mr. Scrope’s accusation of
attacking the poor-law scheme for the purpose of setting up a favourite
project in its place, meaning the location of the peasantry on the waste
lands, which, however, is as much Mr. Scrope’s project as our own. Our
advocacy of waste lands colonisation is quite unconnected with our
opposition to an extended poor-law, to which we should be as
inveterately hostile if there were not an acre of waste land in Ireland.
We rejoice cordially that we have something to propose which may raise a
part of the Irish peasantry into proprietors; but if we had not, we
should not think it any reason for supporting what would lower them all
into beggars or buccaneers. And we persist in seeing, in the effects of
the present attempt to patch up a sort of tumultuary poor-law for a
passing emergency, a foretaste of what would come to pass if those who
agree with Mr. Scrope could Edition: current; Page: [992] succeed in
converting the temporary expedient into a permanent institution. For
neither Mr. Scrope nor any one else can deny that it is the very same
expedient. All they can do, and all that Mr. Scrope does in his letter,
is to promise, that when they are not in so great a hurry they will
pauperize Ireland more carefully, and by a better machinery. The
machinery, indeed, is bad enough, and the hurry is the only excuse for
it. But the grand evil is, being pauperized at all.

“A methodical, orderly system of public works,” consisting of “drainage
or embankment, waste lands reclamations, home colonies, a national
system of railways, new fishing quays, harbours of defence or refuge,”
&c., is what Mr. Scrope contemplates, and apparently as a permanent
measure. This differs very much, he says, from “the lowering of harmless
hills, or making roads to lead nowhere.” It does differ; we never said
it did not. It differs in being useful instead of useless; it differs in
being productive instead of unproductive; it differs in having a chance,
if honestly and skilfully managed (no easy matter in Ireland), of
repaying a part at least of its expense. But does it differ in what is
ten times more important than all this—in the effect on the people’s
minds? Does it make any difference to that, what the work is for? The
only thing the people think of or care about is the offer of wages. As
yet we have not gone the length Mr. Scrope is anxious to go, of
promising them wages. We have guaranteed nothing; we have only given,
and to a part only of the applicants. Yet already all other employment
is abandoned. Accounts, every day more formidable, describe the fields
unsown, and the farmers justifying themselves on the plea that if there
were any crop the labourers would seize it for food, or the landlord for
arrears of rent. Those who should plough or sow prefer government wages,
for which (vide an extract of a letter in our Thursday’s paper)2 they
give work not worth more than threepence a day, receiving tenpence, and
with these wages, or the rent withheld from their landlords, they buy
arms. The wages bestowed in charity they already look upon as a right,
and what the Irish peasant considers his right, he enforces by a penal
code of his own; already the officers of the Board of Works are
assaulted and fired at for withholding employment. The Whiteboy and Rock
system, which has been so successful as a defensive operation, begins to
be used offensively. Death is becoming the penalty, not merely of
ejecting a peasant from land, but of not paying him wages in addition.
Is there any one who can be otherwise than appalled at such a prospect?
Is there any one, not wedded to the idea by previous prejudice, who can
calmly propose to make that a right which it is so terrible a thing that
these misguided creatures should be even beginning to consider as one?

One thing, at least, is now clear, that the Government which adopts this
proposal, if it wishes the cultivation of the soil to be continued, must
prepare to Edition: current; Page: [993] take the farming of all Ireland
into its own hands. Already a cry has been raised, and re-echoed from
Conciliation Hall,3 that since the farmers will not, or cannot, sow
their lands, the Government must do it for them. And the Government will
have to plough, and weed, and manure, and harrow, and hoe: reaping is
the only agricultural operation which it will find the farmers willing
to undertake for themselves.

It is Mr. Scrope’s grand argument, and really the thing most like an
argument which his view of the subject has yet produced, that the
certainty of being saddled with a poor-rate to support the unemployed
labourers would incite the landlords to find employment. And so it
would; but, alas! where will they find the means of employment? Mr.
Scrope himself does not venture to anticipate such a consummation,
except by means of “Government loans” to the landlords, “overriding
mortgages and other incumbrances;” so that the Government, after all, is
to find the means, only using the landlords as the dispensers of them.
But grant that the landlords could and would, under this new stimulus,
employ the people, not one iota would this subtract from the evil.
Compulsory employment is compulsory employment, whether the Government
or the landlords are required to find it. The thing which is altogether
fatal, the evil which no words can exaggerate and no precautions
assuage, is that the people should be told that there is somebody with
an unlimited fund who must find wages for them, let what will happen.
Imagine the whole able-bodied population of Ireland billeted on the
Government, or on the landlords, it is of no consequence which, as their
forced stipendiaries; and as for work, remember the sort of work the
English farmer obtained from the paupers who used to be quartered upon
him under the old labour rate—and then figure a set of so-called work
people, as much more inefficient and as much more unmanageable than even
these, as a Munster peasant exceeds in indolence, self-will, and
lawlessness a Norfolk or Sussex clodhopper. Mr. Senior was within the
mark when he said that the demoralization which in England it had taken
a bad poor-law two centuries to accomplish, would in Ireland be
completed in five years.4 We tremble lest in as many months it should be
already consummated. There is but one thing we can do which can make the
state of Ireland worse, and by that it would be made incurable, unless
by the miserable chances of civil war and confiscation. That one thing
is, the perpetuation, or even the much longer continuance, of
eleemosynary employment.

342.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [32]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 15 DEC., 1846, P. 4

The pamphlet discussed by Mill is that issued by the committee of
O’Connell’s Repeal Association, entitled “On the Employment of the
Labouring Class.” The quotations are all from this pamphlet, which,
unfortunately, has not been located. For the context of the series, see
No. 306. This unheaded first leader is described in Mill’s bibliography
as “A thirty second leading article on Irish affairs, in the Morning
Chronicle of 15th Dec. 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 65).

the repeal association has at last broken ground on the subject of the
Irish distress. It is somewhat late in the day, no doubt, for the organ
and representative of Irish nationality to be beginning to occupy itself
with the question in which, for the last six months, all the immediate
and all the permanent interests of Ireland have been summed up. But
better late than never; and it is still time for a body of men in that
conspicuous position to give the tone to Irish opinion on the subject,
and be almost certain of carrying any plan they may support, if it be
such as the majority of sensible persons can think it worth while to
trouble themselves about. The committee, then, of the Association have
presented an elaborate report “On the Employment of the Labouring
Class,” and this report may, we suppose, be regarded, until further
notice, as expressing the opinions of Mr. O’Connell and the other chiefs
of the Association.

The tone of the report is generally commendable. Except one brief
passage, not a word from beginning to end gives any indication of the
body from which it emanates. With that exception, it seems to come from
men who know neither party nor sect at such a time, and who at other
times may be Whigs or Conservatives, Orangemen or Repealers. It
discusses the subject in a methodical, business-like manner; it bears
marks of local knowledge and careful consideration, and contains, on
points of detail, suggestions well worthy of the attention which they
will no doubt receive from those most concerned. Among other things, it
gives reasons which seem to us unanswerable against what the active
spirits among the landlords are clamouring for, from one end of Ireland
to the other—the substitution of assessment by townlands for assessment
by electoral divisions or by baronies. The report does not deny the evil
which this change is designed to remedy, namely, that the landlords who
relieve and employ the labourers on their own estates have to pay as
much towards the general relief fund as those who do nothing of the
sort. But against this injustice the report proposes a better
remedy—that “every landlord who shall undertake the improvement and
reclamation of land by draining, fencing, &c. &c., should be entitled to
a remittance of the assessment in proportion to the amount expended by
him in such work.” To this we do not see any decisive objection, the
proof resting of course with those who claim the remittance, and being
sifted, as it ought to be, severely.

Edition: current; Page: [995]
But while we see much to praise in this document, compared with most of
the other manifestoes which bodies of Irishmen have yet sent forth on
this trying occasion, we are compelled to say that it displays only the
more strikingly the total want of preparation in men’s minds to deal
with a crisis like the present; the want of resource to meet great evils
by remedies as great; the utter absence of guiding principles and
comprehensive ideas. The committee of the Repeal Association has of
course a plan for reclaiming the waste lands; no one who treats the
subject of Irish redress can be without one; and the committee’s plan
occupies well nigh one-half of their report. The plan is well digested
and minute, and embraces everything which we could possibly desire to
see done with the waste lands—except to give them to the people! This
great popular idea, which a king or minister who wished his name to live
in the hearts of the democracy would greedily seize upon, is the one
thing in the whole matter which the popular assembly of the country, the
collective democracy of Ireland, cannot seize, cannot appreciate. Yes,
the Repeal Association of Ireland actually proposes that the land, after
being reclaimed, shall be sold by auction, sold by and for the profit of
the Saxon Government, rather than given, for a simple repayment of
expenses, to the Celtic peasantry! Reason has indeed a poor prospect in
the affairs of men, when Irish partisans give up their strongest
prejudices to keep in the beaten path, sooner than follow those
prejudices into the most promising new track—new at least to them,
though approved by the experience of every civilised people in the
world, except the inhabitants of the British Isles.

This experiment on the state of the national mind is the more unhappily
significant as there is here no landlordism in the case. The committee
do not think of giving up the reclaimed land to the landlords. Theirs is
no landlord’s scheme. They even propose that those whose estates are
relieved by drafting off cottiers to the waste lands, should pay the
expense of their removal, and contribute “a further sum for the
maintenance for a short time of the cottier, and for contributing to
provide him with a cottage.” A reasonable suggestion, though not of
sufficient importance to be worth persisting in as an essential feature
of the plan. It is not for the sake of the landlords, then, that a
property in the land is grudged to those by whose exertions it is to be
made valuable. From what consideration it is, we know not. The plan is
this: For two years the land is to be occupied rent free. From that time
rent is to commence, and to rise gradually to £6 per farm in the
sixteenth year, the farm consisting of twenty acres; but this is not to
be the maximum, for in twenty-seven or twenty-eight years the rental is
to average 10s. an acre. When the whole farm has been brought under
cultivation, the tenant is to be “entitled in all cases to a lease of
thirty-one years, at a valuation, with a right of renewal.”

Renewal must here mean a lease, not on the same but on a new valuation;
for if the rent was not to be raised there could be no motive for not
making the lease perpetual. The Repeal Association has made great
progress the backward way since 1843. Time was when it did not shrink
from the mention of fixity of tenure.

Edition: current; Page: [996]
After the tenant has obtained a lease, the land, when the Government is
owner in fee, is to be sold by auction, “the occupier having a right of
pre-emption” at the auction price. To that length O’Connell and his
associates are willing to go; thus much of right they consent to
recognise in the industrious peasant over the land which he has changed
from waste into fertility. He may keep it, if he pay for it the full
value which his labour has given to it. These be thy gods, O Israel!1 If
Englishmen have no more generous ideas in Ireland’s behalf than her own
chosen leaders, it will fare ill with her in this her extremity.

We say nothing now of a peasant proprietary as a measure of social
reform and moral regeneration, a means of abolishing the worst of all
forms of landed tenure, and raising up a class of peasantry to be an
example and a guiding influence to the rest. We will be silent on all
the nobler considerations which we have been labouring daily to
inculcate for months past. Since the Association have shut their eyes to
those considerations, we must aim lower to have a chance of hitting the
mark. And we say, that on the very lowest ground on which the decision
can be placed, the committee’s proposition is vastly inferior to ours.
They say that the farms should not be of less than twenty acres each,
because smaller allotments “would not support the tenants’ families
comfortably, enable them to save money, and give trades, or otherwise
provide for their children.” But at twenty acres to each family the
surface of waste land fit for arable, in Mr. Griffith’s computation,
would accommodate only 75,000 families.2 Then, if twenty acres will
support a family in prosperous circumstances, consistently with paying a
full rent, fifteen, or twelve, or ten will do as much, if all rent
beyond the interest of the expenses is foregone. If 75,000 families can
be supported comfortably, and enabled to save money on the one system, a
hundred, or a hundred and twenty, or a hundred and fifty thousand may
receive a similar blessing on the other. That is one consideration, and
no small one. Now for another. The committee of course intend that the
settlers should work vigorously and with ardour on their allotments;
that they should reclaim and fertilize them effectually and quickly;
that the produce of the country may be increased not a little, but as
much as possible by the scheme of reclamation; and perhaps it is not
flattering them too much to suppose them desirous that the cultivators
may be even an example to their countrymen of the industrial virtues—not
of listlessness and indolence, but of energy and activity. With these
objects in view, the encouragement they give to the colonists to put
their shoulders to the wheel and do the work rapidly and effectually is,
that the sooner it is finished the sooner the land will be sold by
auction over their heads, Edition: current; Page: [997] and the more
valuable they have made it the higher rent they will have to pay on
“valuation” for thirty-one years to come! Everybody must see that the
settlement of the waste lands, conducted on such principles, must prove
an entire failure. Instead of the zeal and activity which a property in
the land, or tenure at a fixed quit-rent would inspire, the settlers
then, like the cottiers now, would strive for nothing more than to have
enough to supply their daily meal and pay their rent. They would be
merely such a peasantry as the Irish have ever been, contented on the
brink of starvation; and all things would be as at present, save that
there would no longer be, as now, a reserve of improvable waste to bring
forth when Ireland’s politicians and legislators shall recognise the
duty of civilizing her people, and shall have learnt from the experience
of nations how high a rank among civilizing agents belongs to the wide
diffusion of property in land.


343.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [33]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 16 DEC., 1846, P. 4

This article answers the advocacy of the addition of outdoor relief to
the Irish Poor Law advanced in “The Irish Confiscation,” Spectator, 12
Dec., 1846, pp. 1187-8; the quotations are from p. 1187. For the context
of the series, see No. 306. This unheaded first leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A thirty third leading article on Irish affairs,
in the Morning Chronicle of 16th Dec. 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 65).

the spectator, a journal which we regret to perceive has of late joined
the Poor-law agitators, attempts, in its last number, to convert the
great experimental argument which the present state of Ireland affords
against an extended Irish poor-law, into an argument for it. The
Spectator’s line of reasoning has the recommendation of novelty. It
argues that the mischief is done—that the poor already eat up the whole
income of the land. The landlords were nearly insolvent before—they are
now quite so. They are paupers themselves, enabled still to draw some
rent from the land they call theirs only because England is, in fact,
paying poor-rates for them. This result being the worst that could be
expected from a permanent poor-law, the expectation of it can be no
reason against having the law. The change could do no harm, and might do
good; by bringing into evidence what, though unrecognized, is already
the fact; by compelling the legal landlords to dispose of their nominal
ownership for whatever it will bring; and supplying their place by
people of more resources, and more enterprise, who, by means of better
agriculture, will redeem the estates from their present condition of
insolvency. It is just to ourselves, as well as to the Spectator, to
give its own words:

The present state of Ireland stultifies the grand argument against a
poor-law. It is said that Ireland is too poor for a poor-law; that it
would eat up the rental and confiscate the Edition: current; Page: [998]
landed property of the country. Now, that is the very result to which
the country has come without a poor-law. . . . Landholders cannot carry
on the work of cultivating the land, and they have induced the
Government to advance, by way of loan, enormous sums to be expended on
“reproductive works.”. . .

The mode in which this bounty is used is as extraordinary as its amount.
There is not a particle of evidence to show that the landlords of
Ireland generally have helped to secure any substantial return for the
money so laid out, either in public works or in private “reproductive
works:” on the contrary, there are many indications that the work done
is but a make-believe. . . . It seems therefore only too probable that
the present payment is regarded as temporary subsistence-money; that the
land of the country is, at least to a considerable extent, allowed to
lie fallow; that it will not be cultivated this year unless English
money be furnished for the purpose; and that the whole charge of
poor-rates, wages, and the general agriculture of the land, will be
handed over to England in the lump. . . .

It follows, that without any poor-law, the landlords of Ireland are
insolvent, and their estates confiscated; but that they have an
expedient for extricating themselves, by inducing England to redeem
their estates for them, and also to carry on their business while they
are arranging a composition. The “confiscation” is complete, except that
its consummation is staid by the bounty of England.

And again:

The argument that a poor-law would confiscate the rental, is one that
admits the utter insolvency of the country: it presumes that the produce
of the land is not really more than sufficient for the maintenance of
the producing class, and that if they retained quite enough for their
subsistence there would be no surplus for rent. Now, a great deal of
produce is exported from Ireland, and if the above assumption is right,
that exported produce is not “surplus,” but is part of what is necessary
for the actual subsistence of the producers. According to this argument,
Ireland is reduced to the state of Cholesbury,1 only the want of a
poor-law disguises the fact, and enables the landowners to go on drawing
income abstracted from the actual sustenance of the people. Now this
would be a fact which it would be better not to disguise.

The Spectator possesses and deserves the character of an argumentative
paper; and persons of its stamp of mind are seldom found on the side of
the question which it now advocates. But the poor-law cause has the
property of reducing all its champions to the same level. There is such
an utter absence of decently presentable arguments for it, that in the
rare cases in which thinking persons are led by their feelings to take
that side, they are driven either to the mere declamation and assumption
which are the substitutes for argument with the majority of its
advocates, or, as in the present instance, to ingenious wire-drawn
deductions quite wide of the mark. Who could have expected to find a
writer of any pretensions to intellect discussing the idea of
confiscation in connection with an Irish poor-law, without alluding to
the reason why it is affirmed that a Edition: current; Page: [999]
poor-law, on the principle of out-door relief, would be a confiscation
of the land? The reason, as the Spectator must be well aware, is, that
the people would not work; that their labour would be merely another
name for idleness, and would not repay its own expenses.

If the consequences of a poor-law could be limited to those of which the
Spectator’s argument takes cognizance; if the industry of the country
would be as efficient, its produce as great, its population not greater,
and there were no other change than giving plenty of food and clothing
to people who at present have not enough, there are, we believe, but few
persons who would have anything to say against it, even if it did
swallow up the whole rent. There would be no question then between the
landlords and the peasantry, but only between the landlords and the
nation, as to the justice of making one small section of the community
pay for all. The Spectator simply leaves out of consideration the whole
question; for the only part of it ever disputed is in fact the whole.
The objection made is not that the rates would eat up the present rent,
but that they would eat up any amount of rent, and of taxes in addition;
that they would outstrip every possible increase of production, while
they would at the same time render increase of production impossible.
That the work done by those in eleemosynary employment, by those
quartered on the poor-rates, would in the long run, and under any
superintendence which could be counted on as a permanency, be little
more than nominal; and that when everybody could claim nominal work at
good wages, from the parish or union, nobody would consent to do any
other than nominal work for the small farmer, the capitalist, or the
landlord. This is our argument, and the argument generally of those who
agree with us. It rests upon the familiar laws of human nature, upon the
particular character and habits of the Irish peasantry, and upon the
fact of their present conduct. This is what the Spectator must answer,
or do nothing. Nobody has attempted to answer it; nobody has met it face
to face. Mr. Scrope, no doubt, has attempted to weaken the last branch
of it, by bringing forward the palliations which the present state of
the country suggests for the conduct of the peasantry, and the causes,
other than unwillingness to accept other employment, which may account
for their universal rush to the public works.2 There is no allowance
which can be claimed by any body for this unfortunate people which we
are not eager to concede; and it is true that there is far less of
private employment to be had than in common years. The reason of this
was stated, in an article of this journal on Monday last,3 as strongly
and explicitly as it could possibly be stated by Mr. Scrope. The small
farmers have been accustomed to pay their labourers not in money, but in
patches of ready manured land, of which the rent is worked out in labour
at a stipulated price, and this land the failure of the potatoes has
rendered useless; and though Edition: current; Page: [1000] the farmers
themselves have considerably more money than usual, because all that
part of their produce which is grown for sale has produced an unusually
high price (not to mention the rent they withhold), they are under the
unaccustomed necessity of buying their own food with a part of this
money, instead of expending it on their farms. In such circumstances as
these, it was inevitable that an extraordinary number of people should
be thrown upon the Government for lack of any other available
employment. But this does not account for all we hear and read of, on
unquestionable authority. It does not explain the universal testimony to
the almost entire abandonment of agriculture in whole districts. There
are everywhere some wages to be had for cultivating the soil; there is
everywhere, even now, a great amount. The people throng to the
Government works in some cases because they cannot, but in others
because they will not, work at their ordinary occupations. Read this
extract from the Limerick Chronicle, which we printed on Tuesday, but
which we reproduce on account of the importance and alarming nature of
its announcements:

The farmers of the south are desirous, for obvious reasons, to put in
the soil this month a greater quantity of seed wheat and oats than
usual, in proportion to the much greater breadth of potato ground at
their disposal, and which else is likely to remain waste after the
second year’s failure of the staple crop of Ireland. . . . But
unfortunately they are bereft of all facilities for this most essential
purpose, by the evil operation of the public works system, which in
every barony, parish, or townland cripples the farmer; for he has not
the able and willing staff of labourers heretofore at his command, whose
services are now diverted from field culture to the easier task of
destroying a good road or making a bad one. . . . Spade husbandry, under
the farmer’s eye, is a stiff and vigorous occupation, unlike the task of
throwing a shovel of gravel, or tapping a stone hammer on the side of a
boreheen, while the operators smoke and chat in concert. Universally,
therefore, the labourers prefer this free and easy mode of work to the
farmer’s engagement of 10d. and 1s. a day, reckless of future prospects,
dismal as they are to themselves and others from the neglect of tillage.
. . . An active member of a relief committee near this city writes—“In
such high estimation is the system of road-making held by the peasantry,
that they laugh at the idea of being sent to till the fields, nor will
they do so while they have such work, more in prospect, and which they
prefer to farmers’ employment.” A gentleman, near Ballingarry, on Monday
last, offered 1s. a day to sixty labourers to till his land, but with
one accord they preferred being employed on the roads.4

Does a picture like this afford no experience by which to judge of the
effects of a poor-law grounded on the very principle of the present
temporary relief—except in not being temporary but permanent, not
partial but general, not contingent but certain? It is idle to dream
that any mere improvement of the machinery would obviate evils arising
not from the particular choice of means, but from the thing itself.

344.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [34]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 17 DEC., 1846, P. 4

Mill’s Morning Chronicle leaders on Irish problems were attacked by
“B.F.,” in “The Irish Land Question,” a letter to the editor (28 Nov.,
1846), Spectator, 12 Dec., pp. 1189-90, reprinted in Morning Chronicle,
17 Dec., p. 2. The quotations (except that from Young) are all from this
letter. For the context of the series, see No. 306. This unheaded first
leader is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A thirty fourth leading
article on Irish affairs, in the Morning Chronicle of 17th December
1846”

(MacMinn, p. 65).

we copy from last week’s Spectator a letter on the Irish Waste Lands,
for the sake of the novelty of having to deal on this question with an
avowed opponent. Considering how little the subject had been discussed
when we undertook to call public attention to it, and the very small
portion of study which has generally been bestowed on the fundamental
principles of landed tenure by English politicians, we have ample reason
to be satisfied with the amount of response which we have met with. But
one of the evidences we shall wait longest for, of having made an
impression on the public, and one of the surest harbingers of
approaching success, will be to compel our adversaries to speak out.
When they do, it will be a sign of their having been forced to reflect
on the subject; and the real obstacle the question has to contend with
is, that they never have. The cause of their opposition is not,
generally speaking, anything which they have to say on the subject, but
that it is a new subject to them, and they are ignorant of it. The idea
of peasant proprietors awakens in their minds no distinct objection,
only a vague general impression unfavourable to it. The battle is half
won if they can be induced to think long enough on the matter to make
their objection distinct. Meanwhile, it is hard work for us to do their
part in addition to our own—to find arguments for them, and reply to the
arguments we have found; and we are delighted when we find an opponent
who has the use of speech, and tries to give a reason for his
non-concurrence, and lets us know what we must satisfy him about before
he will give us his support.

The Spectator’s correspondent, who signs himself “B.F.,” and does us the
honour to allude particularly to us, has favoured us with two
arguments—if indeed that appellation can be given to more than one of
them, for the other is the mere cuckoo cry of “spoliation,”
“interference with the rights of landed property,” “shaking the whole
framework of society,” and the rest of it. We should be very glad to
think that this arose from a misapprehension of our meaning, and not
from a supposition pre-occupying all the approaches to the subject. If
he supposes that we have recommended anything bearing the smallest
resemblance to spoliation, we can only tell him that he is in error. If
he alludes to “fixity of tenure” in the sense he attaches to it, namely,
to make the present tenants perpetual lessees at a fixed rent, our
readers know that we have never Edition: current; Page: [1002]
recommended anything of the sort, unless with the free assent of the
landlords, and have never even suggested anything beyond making that
assent a condition of advancing money to any landlord from the treasury
of the State. We fear, however, the fault is not that B.F.
misunderstands what we have said, but that, like many other people, he
has a turn for seeing spoliation in everything. His ideas of what
constitutes it appear to be of a kind which we hardly know how to
characterise, so remote are they from any which we could have supposed,
a priori, to be capable of being held by a rational being. “What,” he
asks, “does all this mean? Is it, frankly, that Government should, or
can interfere with the rights of landed property, so as to dispose of
the waste or the cultivated lands of any man, embarrassed or not, with
or without his own consent? Surely that can hardly be intended.” Has
B.F. dwelt in the cave of Trophonius, or kept company with the Seven
Sleepers,1 from some old time when nobody had heard of a railroad bill,
or a turnpike road bill, or a bill for a new street? With a charity
which does infinite credit to the kindness of his disposition, he is
unwilling to accuse any body of principles so monstrous as those which
are declared and acted upon by Parliament every day of every session,
and embodied in a goodly array of statutes in each year, every one of
which disposes both of the waste and the cultivated lands of scores, or
hundreds of proprietors, often against their strongest opposition, for
some partial and secondary motive of public convenience, which B.F.
himself would not for a moment put into comparison with relieving the
destitution of a people. Does B.F. think all this wrong, or are the
rights of Irish landlords to land which is of no value to them, and
which they have neither made useful nor ornamental, endowed with a
sacredness not accorded to the parks and pleasure-grounds of the English
gentry? Is B.F. yet to learn that there is no violation of property when
there is adequate compensation? He talks of pretium affectionis: who
ever heard of a pretium affectionis in an Irish bog? As for “the value
of his position—his feudal rights,” if any man has a satisfaction in
calling himself lord of so many thousand barren acres, he has a
sufficient equivalent if he receives their money value, together with
the relief afforded to the productive portion of his estate by drafting
off some of the superfluous mouths which prevent him from improving the
cultivation and from realising his rent.

We should apologise for making any answer to stuff so destitute of any
glimmering of sense, or even of plausibility, if it were not, as we said
before, connected with a superstition. It is well known that we ought
not to estimate the Edition: current; Page: [1003] general good sense or
talents of men by the nonsense which they talk on matters in which their
superstitions are interested; and the idea of property, especially
landed property, calls up associations in many minds which partake of
the solemnity of a religious feeling, and quite come up to the most
superstitious forms of religion in the incapacity of reasoning which
they generate. It is, therefore, very possible that B.F. may be a fair
specimen of an intelligent man, as men go, and that there may be no lack
of other intelligent men, as men go, who may be ready to subscribe to
all he has said. This is the excuse we make for treating it seriously;
and if the excuse is not complimentary to human intellect, it is no
fault of ours.

The other argument of B.F. is something more deserving of the name, and
joins issue with us on the point on which we have from the first desired
that the discussion should be engaged. He denies that settlement on the
waste land would improve the people. That is grappling with the real
question. Their habits, he says, are too inveterate:

Habits of wild idleness, generated by hopeless despondency, unfit
multitudes for that labour which, now offered, would support them in
comfort; and who not only stand out themselves against any system of
improvement, but hinder others from availing themselves of it. . . . In
most parts where gratuitous, or too easy tenure of land has been tried,
it has proved a signal failure. A certain amount of responsibility has
been found favourable to industrious habits, and a certain amount of
rent has excited to diligence; but those indolent, ignorant, and
turbulent cottiers of Ireland (as we find them, taken as a class), are
to spring, per saltum, into a race of quiet, industrious, improving, and
thriving farmers, by being put into possession of a few acres of land!
Let those who dream this dream be assured that it is a delusion fraught
with danger. Such improvement, when it comes, must be gradual, and very
slow.

This objection differs from the other in having a tinge of reason in it;
but its main strength lies in the appeal it makes to men’s natural
reluctance to admit a plan to be worth anything which promises great
good by simple means; for the credulity which people are apt to show in
things relating to their individual interests and objects is seldom
called forth by prospects addressed to so feeble a passion as that of
the public good. The objection does not admit of being completely
answered, for nobody can guarantee the full success even of the most
skilfully devised measures of moral and social reform. One thing,
however, one might almost venture to guarantee, for we do not believe
there is a single example, any where in Europe, of a class of peasant
proprietors who are not eminently industrious. To elevate the Irish
peasantry into proprietors would, we believe, be a sovereign remedy for
their “habits of wild idleness;” habits which B.F. himself describes as
“generated by hopeless despondency,” and which we propose to remove by
changing their despondency into hope and confidence. Does he think that
because they “stand out against any system of improvement” which
presupposes their removal from the soil, they would stand out against
being made landed proprietors? As for the unfavourable verdict which he
Edition: current; Page: [1004] pretends has been given by experience, he
only shows that he has not mastered the very elements of the scheme
proposed. He has overlooked the feature on which the whole efficacy
depends—the perpetuity. It is not “gratuitous or too easy tenure of
land” that is wanted. The charm does not lie there. It is not paying no
rent that makes the peasant proprietor industrious; it is that the land
is his own. Give a man the secure possession of a bleak “rock,” as
Arthur Young says, “and he will turn it into a garden; give him a nine
years’ lease of a garden,” and, even though you give it him rent free,
“he will convert it into a desert.”2 Until the plan of “secure
possession” has been tried in Ireland, let us hear no more of its
“signal failure.” Whoever chooses to study the subject may learn that it
has been tried largely in almost every country of the Continent, and, as
a source of unremitting industry, never known to fail; and but rarely as
an incentive to prudence.

We never thought otherwise than that a great improvement in the habits
of the Irish peasantry “must be gradual and very slow.” We allow them an
entire generation—a term which, under similar circumstances to those we
propose, has been sufficient to work a complete revolution in the French
peasantry, Celts like themselves, once the most wretched people in
Europe, now beyond all comparison the happiest. We know not why an Irish
peasantry should take longer to reclaim than a French. It is the
grossest exaggeration to pretend that the Irish are incurably indolent:
their indolence is the result of a social condition in which they can
seldom benefit themselves by exertion; and no people on earth are found
capable of more persevering industry under far less encouragement to it
than our plan would hold out. But our reliance is not on the existing
generation, it is on their children. The faults of the Irish peasantry
are the result of their circumstances; and it would be found in Ireland,
as it has been found in France, that the generation born and brought up
in the new circumstances would be a new people.


345.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [35]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 19 DEC., 1846, P. 4

In continuation of his debate with Mill (see No. 316), Scrope had
replied to No. 341 in a letter to the editor (14 Dec., 1846), Morning
Chronicle, 18 Dec., p. 3, from which the quotations are taken. For the
context of the series, see No. 306. This unheaded leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A thirty fifth leading article on Irish affairs,
in the Morning Chronicle of 19th Decemb. 1846 (the third leader)”

(MacMinn, p. 65).

in yesterday’s morning chronicle we inserted another letter addressed to
us by Mr. Poulett Scrope, as a rejoinder to our reply to his last
letter. There is so Edition: current; Page: [1005] much of good
intention in Mr. Scrope, and so much more serious an attempt than usual
with his compeers to meet the objections to his scheme on argumentative
ground, that we do not grudge him the compliment of a further
prolongation of controversy. His reasons, too, are more like reasons
than those we usually meet with, and in combating them we have the
satisfaction of contending with the best that has been said, or we
believe can be said for his cause.

Mr. Scrope in this letter keeps close to the subject, and states
succinctly and clearly, and in due concatenation, the grounds of his
opinion. This is what an opponent who is a sincere lover of truth must
desire. It is the way to show to the reader, and to Mr. Scrope himself,
how far he is answered, or whether he is answered or not, and it enables
the answerers to know, and to make known, to what extent they perhaps
agree with him in his premises, however widely they differ from his
conclusion.

Mr. Scrope says, that “in order to civilise Ireland”—to put a stop to
the “universal spirit of combination against the law”—it is necessary to
secure the people “from the risk of perishing through want, and to
impress their minds with the conviction of such security being certain
and accessible.” This is also necessary for putting “an end to that
universal mendicancy and vagrancy which is at least as heavy a tax as a
well-administered poor-rate.” To do this “you must give a right to
relief in destitution.”

In all this, except the concluding sentence, we entirely agree. We have
never thought that Ireland could be civilised without, as a part of the
process, not only securing the people against perishing from want, but
also making them feel themselves to be secure against it. Unless this
security can be afforded, the peasantry will continue, even if the
potato famine subside, to revolve in the wretched round of poverty and
recklessness, recklessness and poverty. To give them any chance of
regeneration they must have food and employment; but it is not necessary
that they should have a right to food and employment. They must be
enabled to earn it, but not empowered to demand it. Strange that it
should be so difficult to seize the distinction between these two
things. Is it not the testimony of experience in all branches of human
affairs (while human nature is what it is, in its ordinary specimens),
that men never trouble themselves to earn what they are able to demand?
Is not this true, not of money only, but of all things else which human
beings claim from one another? Is it not the source of most of the crime
and all the tyranny which exist in the world, and of the greater part of
the difficulty experienced in governing mankind?

It may be said, perhaps, by Mr. Scrope, that conjointly with remedial
measures, and while doing everything in our power to raise up for the
people an abundance of food and the amplest field of employment, we must
also, to complete the impression on their minds, afford an assurance,
not inferential but positive, of a sufficient maintenance. To which we
reply, that to give them such an assurance in the present state of their
minds is certain to render any and every Edition: current; Page: [1006]
remedial measure inoperative. No measure calculated to be of use to
Ireland has a chance of effect unless the exertions of the people are
called forth with considerable intensity to co-operate with it. With
their present habits, the only motive which is found sufficient to
produce any real exertion, and that not always, is the fear of
destitution. From that fear it is proposed permanently to relieve them.
What other motive is to be provided? It must be force; for reason and
experience are equally against the wild idea that even a much more
industrious people than the Irish will work with any efficacy for
employers who are not permitted to dismiss them, unless it be like
slaves, under compulsion, and if that is to be the resource, it is good
to bethink ourselves, in the first instance, whether we can compel them
to be compelled.

What the Irish need, and unless it can be given them their case is
desperate, is a reasonable assurance of finding support by earnestly
seeking it, not a guarantee that it will be provided for them unsought.
If we might be permitted to look forward to a time when this work of
benevolence and duty should have been accomplished, and a generation of
Irish people should have grown up under its influence—when the peasant
shall have learnt to look to himself for support, with a well-grounded
confidence of always finding it—then, to provide for accidental cases of
distress, there would not necessarily be the same objection to a
compulsory poor-law. When the Irish shall have become what the English
were during the century and a half in which the Elizabethan poor-law
worked well, they will be capable of bearing an Elizabethan poor-law.

But then it must be the Elizabethan law as it was, and not as it
probably would be. It must be the poor-law as practically modified by
its administration. It is a known fact, that until near the end of the
eighteenth century the provisions of the law were administered with
extreme rigidity; that every effort was used by the magistrates and
gentry to prevent the rates from increasing, and the population from
multiplying, which accordingly increased very slowly; that the
landowners not only systematically discouraged the building of cottages,
but pulled down many, and even whole villages disappeared in the manner
commemorated and lamented in Goldsmith’s poem.1 As soon as this rigid
system was discontinued, pauperism and poverty came in apace, and less
than half a century brought us to 1834. It was not, as Mr. Scrope seems
to think, only or chiefly the allowances in aid of wages which acted
thus disastrously; it was that, together with the relaxed system of
relief to the able-bodied generally, whether by parish works or the
roundsman and labour-rate system. Even now, under an enactment expressly
designed to correct these evils, the clamour of the agitators has been
so successful in weakening the law, and destroying the influence of
those whose duty it is to enforce it, that it is not, in any effectual
manner, enforced, and the poor-rates, in a highly prosperous state of
the country, have again increased for Edition: current; Page: [1007] the
last few years with alarming rapidity. Is it Mr. Scrope’s opinion that
the rigid practice of the last century would be adopted in Ireland? Is
it, even, his intention?

There is now but one argument of Mr. Scrope which we have not answered,
either in the present or in former articles, and this is, that the Irish
are already pauperized. They are already as miserable, as averse to
industry, and as reckless in multiplying their numbers as they could
possibly be made, and nothing we can do will make them worse. We must
absolutely protest against this, as it appears to us, unworthy mode of
treating the question. Not merely because the fact is not so; not merely
because almost all Ulster, and parts of the other three provinces, still
remain to be degraded to the condition which Mr. Scrope argues upon as
consummated; not merely because, if the peasants already multiply
recklessly, that is no reason for making a margin for them to multiply
farther, until they starve down all other people to the level of
themselves. Not for these only, but for more comprehensive reasons.
Because Ireland is so wretched, because we have thus neglected our duty
to her, is she therefore to be delivered up for an experimentum in
corpore vili, to a treatment of which, on every principle of reason, the
effect must be to render all her maladies incurable? If Mr. Scrope could
have said the direct contrary of what he has said; if he could have said
the Irish are laborious, self-relying, proudly independent, they will
never choose to live on alms, they will never consent to depend on
parish pay, they are a people whom you cannot pauperize, we could have
understood then, though we should have thought the doctrine a
short-sighted one, that it might have been urged that even a bad
poor-law would be innocuous. But on Mr. Scrope’s way of arguing, it
would be a good reason for plying a man with brandy because he is
already dead drunk, or administering arsenic because he has been
poisoned, or amputating a limb because it is paralysed, or putting out
an eye because it has a cataract, or any other folly which would at once
aggravate the malady, and close the door on any possibility of cure. He
prescribes, not homoeopathic but monster doses of the very thing which
caused the disease.

That even in the lowest deep there would be found a lower deep into
which Ireland can still be plunged, and also that after every reasonable
abatement the phenomena of the existing crisis still afford a strong
experimental confirmation of all that we have pointed out, is the
conviction of many good judges besides ourselves. The following is an
instructive paragraph from the Northern Whig:

As a mode of escape or relief from present difficulties, there is a
tendency to press upon us a new poor-law—one which would give claimants
a right to relief, and which would secure out-door support when
apparently necessary. . . . Surely it is enough to refer to the present
mighty rush of pauperism—of determined pauperism—to awaken any one to a
sense of the tremendous peril of a system of the kind alluded to.
Government proposed a plan of aid which involved low wages—a plan
designed to render the work unpopular; but such a shout was raised, and
so great was the pressure, that strict prudence became impracticable.
Then followed liberal wages (as times go here) with quarter
work—pauperism, in fact; and behold, we have crowding multitudes eager
for the government wages Edition: current; Page: [1008] and idleness,
and ready to let Ireland become a barren waste, for aught they care.
Give us such a poor-law as we have referred to, and what would be the
consequence? Its dire extent we can hardly attempt to conjecture; but
that degradation which we have as yet seen nothing to match, and wasting
and blasting idleness and recklessness to which heretofore nothing in
Ireland could furnish a parallel, would ensue, is a state of things as
clear, from such a system, as any anticipated event, however clear,
could possibly be.2


346.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [36]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 22 DEC., 1846, P. 4

Mill’s scheme of waste-land colonization had been discussed in a leading
article in the Globe and Traveller, 15 Dec., 1846, p. 2, from which the
following quotations are taken. For the context of the series, see No.
306. This unheaded first leader is described in Mill’s bibliography as
“A thirty sixth leading article on Irish affairs, in the Morning
Chronicle of 22d Dec. 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 65).

the advocates of waste lands colonization in connection with peasant
proprietorship need no longer complain of having to fight with shadows.
As the proposal gains ground, the objections of some and the doubts of
others are gradually working themselves into shape, and in time the
question will have a chance of being rationally discussed. The Globe in
a recent number has adverted to the subject in a tone between doubt and
dissent. Our contemporary is not satisfied that a large advance of the
national capital “would be economically and reproductively employed in
the manner indicated. It may be so, but it requires more evidence and
more examples than have been furnished.” He admires our “boldness in
overleaping, per saltum as it were, all the unavoidable preliminary
difficulty and doubt of the operation, to say nothing of the limited
extent of benefit after all effected, if effected.” The passage being
short, we shall quote the whole remainder of it:

We do not need to decry the condition of those countries where small
properties exist, and which we may consider to have remained in, or
reverted to, an accustomed and primitive condition. For our part,
indeed, we cannot doubt, notwithstanding Mr. Laing’s enthusiasm, that
the purely agricultural condition of Norway is anything rather than
progressive, or, in all points, satisfactory.1 A people with whom it is
not an unfamiliar expedient to mix their “bread-stuff” with saw-dust,
cannot enjoy a condition of well-being quite so superior to the vulgar
aids of commerce as appears at first view; and M. de Sismondi’s pictures
of primitive rural felicity are mingled in all his writings with
jeremiades on the changes change of times tends to produce.2 The
question is, whether a Edition: current; Page: [1009] favourite system
of rural economy can really be reproduced at will “without any loss to
the public.”3 This is what we can hardly admit to have yet been shown by
all those who have said it—or rather, who have assumed it a work for the
state of admitted feasibleness.

It is a great help to our argument when any who differ from us will take
the trouble to let us see where the shoe pinches. But in our
contemporary’s case it seems to pinch so equally everywhere, that we
hardly know at which end to attempt easing it. He seems as much in doubt
on the points on which we should have thought doubt was impossible, as
on those on which it was natural and to be expected. For example, a
great part of his apprehension seems to be lest the public should lose
money by the proposed operation. He is afraid, apparently, lest the
improvement of the waste lands should not pay. It is really too much to
charge people with assuming, and not proving, such a thing as this. One
cannot be always slaying the slain.4 A time comes when things may be
considered as sufficiently proved. Let our contemporary ask any one who
has paid any attention to the subject. Let him consult any of the
voluminous reports by public officers, committees, or commissions,
expressly on the point. He will find in these no lack of the “examples”
he desiderates; but it positively weakens the case to rest upon examples
what is grounded on the opinion of all competent judges and on public
notoriety. The thing would have been done long ago by the landlords for
their own profit, if they had not been wanting in three
requisites—capital, enterprise, and concert. These three conditions the
Government can supply. The Globe does not surely doubt that the
reclaimed land will bear a rent which will repay to the State, as it
would have repaid to the landlord, an ample profit on the outlay, even
if tenanted on no better principle than the miserable cottier system.
Besides, as the work would be done by the labourers whom the State is
already maintaining without any profit or advantage whatever, it would
really cost the State nothing. All this is so clear that no one now
seems to hesitate about the propriety of turning some part at least of
the relief expenditure into this channel. For whose benefit to do it,
and on what tenure the land shall be thereafter held, are the points
about which opinion is not yet unanimous.

“The limited extent of the benefit effected,” if effected at all, is the
next difficulty with our contemporary. He must mean, we suppose, that
there is not space enough on the waste lands to locate more than a small
part of the surplus population. We believe, on the contrary, that the
measure, if vigorously and not languidly carried out, together with the
other improvements which it would facilitate, would make over-population
in Ireland for many years to come a thing Edition: current; Page: [1010]
of memory alone. The time is not arrived for the discussion of details.
But we must declare our opinion, that Mr. O’Brien’s fifty thousand
families,5 and even the seventy-five thousand of the Repeal Association6
(though either of those numbers subtracted from the labour market would
be no inconsiderable ease to it), are a wholly inadequate estimate of
the numbers which might and ought to be accommodated on the reclaimed
land. It may be very desirable that the allotments should not be under
twenty acres; but it is impossible to have everything that is desirable.
All other considerations ought to be subordinate to that of making room
for the greatest number of the people who can be supported in comfort.
With the present habits of the Irish peasantry, it is perhaps even
better that the size of the farm should not be sufficient to enable the
holder to support a family in comfort without a considerable degree of
labour and perseverance. Both the moral and the economical advantages of
peasant properties may be enjoyed in considerable proportion, even where
many of them are not of sufficient extent to make the proprietor wholly
independent of the labour market. Such is the condition of a great part
of the proprietor-peasantry of France, even in its happiest provinces.
Since our contemporary likes examples, we will give him a pleasing one.
Near Langeais on the Loire, Mr. Inglis, in a pedestrian tour, was
overtaken by a countryman:

He was going to work on some gentleman’s property about a mile forward,
and as we walked along, I questioned him as to his condition. He said he
did not see how any man could be happier than himself. He had a wife and
three children, and loved them all; and he had enough to give them. He
was employed in field labour every day till three o’clock, and received
25 or 30 sous, according to the species of the labour. When he returned
home he looked after his own little kingdom, for he possessed as much
land as supplied him with bread, and sufficed to keep a cow and a couple
of pigs. In fact, said he, J’ai tout ce que je désire. Contentment like
this is rarely found in England; but the man, I have no doubt, spoke as
he felt. I asked him if he was contented with the Government? All
governments, he said, were alike to him, so as they kept at peace, and
allowed him to live at home.7

Was this man’s land of no value to him, although during two-thirds of
his time he worked for hire? Would he have been the same happy man
without it, or if he had held it, like a parish allotment, as a tenant
at will? Observe too the state of wages which co-exists in Touraine with
the general diffusion of landed property. For two-thirds of his day’s
work this peasant received from a shilling to fifteen pence; as much as
a Dorsetshire labourer receives for the whole of his, and in a much
cheaper country. We do not rest our case upon single instances, but we
desire to warn those who share our opinion, that they should not pitch
their notions too high with regard to the extent of provision in land
which is necessary to give a peasant proprietor the feelings of
happiness and independence.

Edition: current; Page: [1011]
The Globe next doubts the authority of M. de Sismondi, because his
writings contain “jeremiades on the changes change of times tends to
produce.” We know not who is a competent witness, if the testimony of
one of the most accomplished, instructed, and intellectual men of his
time, respecting things which he had all his life observed and studied,
is to be overruled because he avowedly disliked some of the features of
our commercial civilization. The Globe calls his representations
“pictures of primitive rural felicity,” just as if he was dreaming of
things long past, instead of testifying to what took place under his own
eyes. In his eulogies on peasant properties, M. de Sismondi was not
extolling a thing past from dissatisfaction with the present; on the
contrary, it was the intelligence, independence, and comfort which he
saw in the present, under the system of peasant properties, and even
under the far inferior system of the Tuscan métayers,8 which made him,
even to excess, distrustful of those modern tendencies which he
identified with doctrines destructive of all this virtue and happiness.
It is assuming a great deal, however, to number the destruction of
peasant properties among “the changes change of times tends to produce.”
It is not change of times, but false economical doctrines, now on the
wane, which threatened to subvert the social state so justly prized by
Sismondi; and it really seems to us, looking at Europe on the whole,
that it is the large properties rather than the small which are
vanishing before the spirit of the time.

Among so many doubts, the one thing which the Globe “cannot doubt” is
(of all things in the world), the “satisfactory condition” of the
agricultural population of Norway. We did think that the case of Norway
was universally conceded to us—so much so, that we have not thought it
necessary to say anything about it, except an occasional allusion.9 But
we have no objection to enter at large on the condition of Norway, since
we are challenged to it. It will require something more to shake the
admitted fact of the enviable condition of the Norwegian peasantry than
to remind us of the substitutes to which people may occasionally be
driven in a country over a great part of which corn will not grow; while
in all parts the climate is so precarious, that it can scarcely be said
that there is any sure reliance on getting bread at all.


347.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [37]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 23 DEC., 1846, P. 4

Continuing the discussion with Scrope on Irish waste lands (see No.
316), Mill quotes from the “Postscript” to Scrope’s How Is Ireland to Be
Governed?, 2nd ed. (London: Ridgway, 1846), pp. 40-66, which had been
added since the 1st ed. (London: Ridgway, Edition: current; Page: [1012]
1834). For the context of the series, see No. 306. This unheaded first
leader is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A thirty seventh leading
article on Irish affairs, in the Morning Chronicle of 23d Dec. 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 66).

the two preliminary questions respecting Irish waste lands may, we
conceive, be looked upon as decided. That their reclamation shall be
undertaken on a large scale by the State is commanded by the necessity
of the case. Since the State has at any rate to provide support, during
months to come, for a large proportion of the whole Irish people, there
must be found for them such work as will best repay the outlay, and
afford security against the recurrence of a similar necessity hereafter.
A second question, we believe, may now also be regarded as a question no
longer. When the lands are reclaimed, it will not be to give them back
to the landlords. That brilliant idea has been hooted out of court. We
doubt if there will be found a landlord courageous enough to divide the
House upon it.

Discussion therefore may now concentrate itself on the subsequent
question—what to do with the lands when reclaimed. Substantially there
are but two things which can be done with them. They must either be
given to the people, or made the most of as the property of the State.
Doubtless there are more ways than one of doing either of these things,
and a mixed course also is possible. The land may be granted to a select
body of the peasant class in free gift. This, however, is proposed by
nobody. It may be granted at a quit-rent sufficient to pay the interest
of the expenses, with or without a further payment to redeem the
principal. It may be leased in perpetuity at a rent more than adequate
to these purposes, but not amounting to a rack-rent. It may be let for a
term, either in the Irish or in the English mode. Or, finally, it may be
sold outright for the profit of the State. The choice among all these
modes of disposing of the land will depend upon the opinion entertained
of the comparative importance of the different purposes in view. If any
value is attached to the creation of a superior class of peasantry, as a
model and an object of emulation to the rest, some one of the plans
first mentioned will probably be adopted. If it be thought of any
importance to make the British Government popular with the Irish
peasantry; to confer on a class who have experienced so little of its
benefits a favour which even they can appreciate, and to avoid the
appearance of making a profitable concern of our philanthropy; nothing
more will be sought, as an equivalent for the land, than repayment of
the expenses incurred for purchasing and reclaiming it. But if all that
is cared for be to meet the emergency for the present, and improve the
productive resources of Ireland for the future, getting at the same time
as much money as possible for the State, to be applied to the repayment
of the large sums it will have expended from first to last on Irish
destitution, the natural expedient is to sell the lands for the most
which they will bring.

This course has, however, been advocated by persons sincerely impressed
with the importance of waste lands colonization as a means of creating a
peasant Edition: current; Page: [1013] proprietary. Mr. Scrope, for
instance, in his pamphlet, How is Ireland to be Governed? of which all
the part relating to waste lands is highly interesting and valuable,
gives his countenance to this among other modes of accomplishing the
object:

My proposal is, [says Mr. Scrope,] that the State should, through the
medium of the Board of Works, purchase at their present value such
portions of the waste lands of Ireland, in masses of not less than 500
or 1,000 acres lying together as may be required; that these should be
by the same board opened up, by roads, main drains, and any other
improvements the board thinks desirable, and then divided into small
farms of from five to fifty acres, and offered in the open market for
sale, with a clear title in fee, or let on perpetuity leases at a fixed
quit rent, sufficient, at least, to pay all expenses. I believe by such
a measure we might in a very few years locate on these barren wastes
some hundreds of thousands of industrious landowners.

[Pp. 54-5.]

Mr. Scrope computes that every acre reclaimed will at the utmost have
cost the Board of Works £10, and that being in a state worth from £1 to
£2 per acre rent, it will sell for at least £20 on the average, yielding
to the Government a profit of cent. per cent.; a most promising
pecuniary speculation. [P. 56.] But how is this reconcileable with Mr.
Scrope’s other object, the creation of a peasant proprietary? He has an
answer for this too. We will give it in his own words:

Some persons may doubt whether purchasers will be found for the small
farms. Few, however, who know Ireland well, are unacquainted with the
fact that there is a vast amount of money in the possession of farmers
already in Ireland, some concealed in old stockings, some in the thatch
of their houses, but much invested in savings’ banks. In the Savings’
Bank of Cork, for example, there is no less than £200,000, the property
of farmers, averaging £34 a piece, therefore belonging to 6,000 persons
in number. The same is true of very many other parts of Ireland. The sum
remitted from Ireland to England annually for investment in the English
funds is very large, and these unprofitable investments paying but a
very low rate of interest, are made only because no opportunity offers
for the purchase of land at home, on which the savings and the industry
of the farmers may be employed with the certainty of reaping its entire
fruits. . . . No one can doubt that purchasers will be forthcoming, who
knows that there are plenty to give £10 per acre for the mere good-will
of farms held on will at a high rent.

[Pp. 56-7.]

This last observation refers to the Ulster tenant-right, and to the high
price given for a perpetuity of tenure and limitation of rent,
guaranteed, not by contract, but by the fear of being fired at.1

The facts stated respecting the hoards possessed by Irish farmers are
highly important to the question in hand, because they supply one
leading condition of the beneficial operation of the plan—a means of
sifting, as it were, the peasant class, and trying the experiment of
small properties with a set of proprietors the Edition: current; Page:
[1014] best adapted for it. If the possessors of these hoards are indeed
small farmers—if they are actual cottiers, and not of that class of
middling and large tenant-farmers who do, though sparingly, exist even
in the South of Ireland—no one will doubt that cottiers who in the
unfavourable circumstances of their situation have actually saved and
laid by such considerable sums of money, have the very first claim on
any boon which is conferred on industry and economy, and are the persons
in whose hands the boon will most prosper. We should not hesitate
therefore to give the preference in the assignment of the reclaimed
lands to those farmers who could repay at once the whole expense
incurred for the reclamation. This would not only be a valuable feature
of the plan, but might be even essential to its complete success.

We would stop here, however. The reasons seem to us unanswerable against
selling the reclaimed lands to the highest bidder. We do not say that
even in that case no good would be done; it would scarcely be possible
to reclaim so much land, and distribute it among a new class of owners,
absolutely without any public benefit. But we are strongly of opinion
that the benefit would be comparatively trifling, and that the persons
benefited would not be the peasantry of Ireland. This is apparent from
Mr. Scrope’s own data.

Of 6,000 farmers who have deposits in the Cork Savings’ Bank, the
average deposit, according to Mr. Scrope, is £34. It is not likely that
those who have deposits in the savings’ bank have also hoards, or that
any have hoards exceeding this amount. We may then assume £34 as the
largest amount which any considerable number of Munster peasants could
invest in land. How far would this go, at Mr. Scrope’s estimate of £20
an acre? It would not suffice to buy two acres; and the farms he
proposes vary from five to fifty. We have argued that an extent of
twenty acres is too high a minimum; but we certainly never thought of
reducing it to two. Even two acres bought at that price would drain the
peasant, would leave him nothing to buy tools, seed, and manure, or to
support his family until the first harvest. If the lands are sold in the
manner proposed, they will not be bought by peasants, but by a totally
different class—by middlemen, to be leased at rack-rents to cottiers on
the present miserable system; or at best by English and Scotch, who may
be willing to exchange the state of tenant-farmers in the one island for
that of proprietor-farmers in the other. It may be said that the
introduction of such people and their capital into Ireland would be a
public benefit. Doubtless it would; but not if the new proprietors
mainly consisted of such people. It would be senseless to expect any of
the moral and social advantages of a yeomanry from a class composed of
newly introduced foreigners, more completely separated from the
peasantry than even their present landlords; connected with them by no
sympathy, having no influence on their minds, and whose position would
excite no emulation, because it would have been acquired by no means
which it would be in their power to imitate. Unless the new proprietors
are Irish peasants, all that part of the scheme is a total failure.
Edition: current; Page: [1015] If the lands are to be held by English
owners, and cultivated by English capital, it is far better that the
farms be large, and the processes scientific.

Even supposing that it were deemed practicable and desirable to confine
the competition for the new lands to peasants and Irishmen, the plan of
selling them by competition would not be less objectionable, while in
that case it would, moreover, be illusory. Far from being able to buy a
farm of Mr. Scrope’s smallest extent, five acres, at a profit to the
State of cent. per cent., very few of the peasantry would be able to pay
at once even the £50 which he supposes would simply repay the Government
for its expenses. Our plan would be to give at once a grant in fee to
every peasant who could repay the whole amount, returning a part of it
to him, if necessary, on loan, to provide himself with the means of
cultivation. Next to those who could pay all, the preference should be
given to those who could pay the largest portion: an equivalent for the
balance, and for any necessary advances of funds, being imposed on the
land in the form of a fixed quit-rent.


348.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [38]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 24 DEC., 1846, P. 4

The Globe and Traveller had replied to No. 346 in the evening of the
same day, 22 Dec., 1846, p. 2, in a leader that Mill here quotes. For
the context of the series, see No. 306. This unheaded leader is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “A thirty eighth leading article on
Irish affairs, in the Morning Chronicle of 24th December 1846 (the
second leader)”

(MacMinn, p. 66).

now that the colonization of the Irish wastes is becoming a practical
question, the attention of the Government and the public may
appropriately be called to a variety of points connected with the mode
of execution, which it would have been premature to discuss so long as
the main idea floated as a mere project before people’s minds. Until its
advantages were recognised there was little use in bringing under
consideration its practical difficulties. The time, however, has now
come when these must be estimated, and a choice made among the various
means by which they may be met.

If the introduction of peasant properties failed to realise the benefits
expected from it, the cause must either be want of industry in the
proprietors, or want of providence, chiefly in respect to population. Of
these dangers the latter is the more serious; of the former we cannot
entertain any real apprehension. We believe there is no instance of a
class of peasant proprietors who are not industrious. In general their
industry is an example and a wonder, deserving almost the name given to
it in a statistical account of the canton of Schaffhausen, published a
few years ago, which says that until the last half century there was
Edition: current; Page: [1016] not much to praise in the agricultural
condition of the canton, except the superhuman industry of the people.1
This is instar omnium.2 Even where there is nothing else to be said for
peasant proprietors, their industry is “superhuman.” We mean, of course,
in any country where there is protection to property, and where they are
not subject to arbitrary taxation. It is because the Irish peasantry
have their habits of industry yet to acquire that we have contended that
peasant properties cannot but be a benefit to them, even should the
experiment fail in every other respect. The Globe indeed, in its reply
to our article of Tuesday, ridicules the idea of “catching up whole
masses of destitute peasantry, with not one habit of methodical
industry, or improvement, or forethought about them” . . . “masses whose
utmost ambition hitherto has been to vegetate on potatoes,” and
“planting” these, “at a single stroke, on lands reclaimed at the public
expense,” in the hope of converting them, “with the touch of an
adminstrative harlequin’s wand, into thriving proprietors.” The Globe
does not surely imagine that it is proposed to make a progress through
Clare or Tiperrary, seize hold of the first fifty thousand ragged people
you meet, and drag them obtorto collo3 to be made proprietors of. There
are even in Ireland abundance of industrious poor, and still greater
abundance who want nothing but sufficient inducements and encouragements
to be industrious. There are never wanting, even now, peasants who go
through the whole toil of reclaiming several acres of bog or mountain
land without any assistance, on the tenure of mere squatters, with no
prospect but that of paying a rackrent as soon as the man whom the law
calls the owner may think it worth while to make the demand. Surely the
human faculties are not unequal to devising the means of reaching these
very people, and making them, and not the idle and indifferent, the
recipients of the intended boon.

The truth is, that the means of making this distinction are extremely
obvious, nothing more being requisite than to leave everything that can
be done by a peasant to be done by the proprietor. Let him have the land
itself, not gratuitously (on that point the Globe is fighting shadows),
but at cost price, or a rent equivalent to it, including in both the
cost of the original purchase and the cost of the improvement. But the
improvement should be limited to such drainage or other works as can
only be accomplished through command of money, and on a large scale.
There should be no building of houses, no inclosing, no preparation of
the soil for culture; lime or other permanent manures may be supplied,
but they should be paid for; and the fertilization of the land by
Edition: current; Page: [1017] coating it with the subsoil (when of
suitable quality) is a thing which the proprietors should be instructed
to do for themselves, rather than a thing which should be done for them.
Any allotment not reclaimed within a given time should revert to
Government, compensation being made for all useful work actually
performed; and the land should at once be regranted to a worthier
occupant.

There is a larger element of uncertainty affecting the realization of
the hoped for benefits, so far as they depend not on the industry but on
the prudence of the new proprietors. Property indeed, and the
possibility of acquiring it, are to the peasant, as to all others who
must work to live, the great school of prudence as of the other
industrial virtues. But it is not always an effectual one. Peasant
proprietors are invariably industrious; they are generally, but not
invariably, provident. The incentives to industry are more direct and
nearer at hand than the restraints on over-population; and the bad
habits of the Irish peasantry are more inveterate on the last than on
the former point. There is no danger that the new proprietors, if
selected on any reasonably discriminating principle, would be deficient
in industry. But they may increase too fast, and break up the land into
minute sub-divisions. It is no reason against trying a remedy of known
efficacy, that it is not infallible. But it is a reason for guarding it
by all practicable auxiliary precautions.

With this object in view, it would probably be advisable that the State,
in the cases at least in which any part of the repayment of its outlay
is commuted for rent, should, notwithstanding the fixity of tenure,
retain sufficient of the rights of a landlord to prevent the little
estates from being subdivided without its consent. It should recognise
only one proprietor, and allow on each farm only a single dwelling.
These conditions, made known from the first, and expressly inserted in
the legal instrument of grant, would bear obviously in their aspect the
public motives by which they were dictated, and could neither be
complained of nor misunderstood. For another, but equally important
reason, the consent of Government should be required to every sale, or a
right of pre-emption should be reserved to it. The object of this would
be to prevent the small properties from being bought up, and thrown into
large ones.


349.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [39]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 26 DEC., 1846, P. 4

For the context, see No. 306. This unheaded first leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A thirty ninth leading article on Irish affairs,
in the Morning Chronicle of 26th December 1846”

(MacMinn, p. 66).

among the questions which present themselves in framing a scheme for the
location of peasant proprietors on the waste lands, there is none on
which there is Edition: current; Page: [1018] likely to be greater
diversity of opinion than on the size of the allotments. The question is
not without its difficulties. Excess on either side is attended with
serious inconveniences; and no unvarying standard can be applied to so
many diversities of soil and situation. Much consideration, under the
guidance of local knowledge and practical experience, is requisite for
steering skilfully between the two extremes; and it does not belong to
us to decide the question. It may be possible, however, to give some
indication of the general principles which should be kept in view in its
decision.

We think that each estate should be of a size fully to occupy, and at
the same time (after payment of the quit-rent) amply to remunerate the
vigorous and well-directed industry of a single family. We see strong
objections to fixing the average extent either below or above this
standard. The portion of land should neither be so extensive as to
require the aid of hired labour, unless in an occasional emergency, nor
so small as to leave any part of the proprietor’s time on his hands
which his little estate cannot beneficially occupy.

The disadvantages of making the portions too small are more apparent at
first sight, and are likely, in this country at least, to be more
generally appreciated than those of making them too large. They are
indeed very obvious. A property not sufficient to maintain the
proprietor and his family would leave them still dependent on the labour
market, and would fail to create the feelings of security and
independence which distinguish the proprietor from the hired labourer. A
property sufficient for absolute necessaries, but not adequate for
comforts, would miss the grand object of raising the peasant’s mode of
living and standard of requirement. Affording too, as it would, these
mere necessaries at a much less expense of labour and perseverance than
may justly be annexed as a condition to the boon of being made a
proprietor, it would do little towards correcting habits of listlessness
and semi-idleness. The chief complaint of Arthur Young respecting the
métayers and the very small proprietors in France before the Revolution,
related to the great quantity of idle time they had on their hands.1 In
some states of territorial economy and of the habits of the labouring
class, these considerations would not have so much weight. Where large
farms are so intermixed with small that employment for hire is within
easy reach of every peasant, where the numbers of the people are not
disproportioned to the amount of employment, and their standard of
living is tolerably high—conditions realised in several parts of the
Continent—the peasant may have the security and satisfaction of calling
a piece of land his own, on which he can fall back for mere subsistence
in case of need, without relaxing his exertions to obtain additional
comforts, or acquire the means of saving, by labour for hire. It is
scarcely necessary to say that the condition of Ireland is totally
different. Allotments barely sufficient to afford potatoes would leave
the people what they have Edition: current; Page: [1019] hitherto been,
contented and apathetic, with no wants beyond a meal of potatoes, a
hovel, and rags.

But the objections are almost as strong to making the portions so large
as to require the habitual aid of hired labour for their cultivation. In
the first place, it is a sufficient objection, that if the estates are
larger than necessary, the valuable class of yeomanry which it is
designed to create are proportionally reduced in numbers. With an
average extent of twenty acres, we are brought down to, at most, the
“seventy-five thousand families” of the Repeal Association;2 and this,
though no inconsiderable number, is not sufficient to clear off the
surplus from the old lands, and abolish the cottier system. But,
further, the effect of small landed properties in raising the character
of a peasantry does not consist wholly or principally in their effect on
the proprietors, but still more in the effect on those who may become
proprietors. The estates, then, should not be of such a size, and when
improved of such a value, as would place them too high above the
aspirations of the mere labourer. He should be permitted to feel that by
a degree of exertion and economy, not beyond what is possible even to
him, he may hope one day to possess himself of one of these farms, and
leave it as a property to his children. But, further, the peasants who
would become proprietors of estates averaging twenty acres would be of
the class now called small farmers, and it is already the habit of this
class, when they employ labourers, to pay the wages in land; nor have
they, in general, sufficient pecuniary resources to make the payment
otherwise. If the new proprietors, having more land than they could
themselves cultivate, called in the aid of hired labourers, it would be
impossible to prevent them from paying those labourers in the way to
which they are accustomed, by conacre; that is, by a patch of land on
which the labourer grows his own food, and for which he is debited with
a rent which he works out in labour. It is by no means clear that
conacre (as has been asserted) would perish with the potato,3 and it is
not only not clear, but not at all probable that the potato has
perished. To give land, therefore, of such an extent as to require hired
labour, which labour would be paid with part of the land, is not to
prevent sub-division, but to cause it, and that too in the very worst
way. It is to share the land between one proprietor and one or more
conacre-men, when it might be shared among the same number of
proprietors. If it be said that this kind of sub-letting might be
prevented, we answer that we do not think it could; but that, if so, it
could only be by making it impossible for the proprietor to obtain hired
labour at all; for to refuse him the power of paying for it in the only
thing he has to bestow is a tolerably effectual prohibition. It is
better surely to withhold the land, than to give it and deny the means
of cultivating it. Nor is there anything Edition: current; Page: [1020]
gained by making it necessary for him to have hired labour, even
supposing that he could pay for it. There is no use in having a class of
labourers for hire, scattered singly or by twos or threes over a large
district. The advantage of hired labour is the facility it affords for
combined action, and the practice of industrial operations on a large
scale. For every object which can be attained by the existence of
peasant proprietors, holdings which they can cultivate without hired
assistance are sufficient; nor between this and farming by large
capitals, in the manner of Scotland and Northumberland, is there any
reasonable medium. Either a large net produce, or a superior class of
peasantry, should be the object. We should not hesitate a moment which
to choose; but whichever is chosen, let it by all means be pursued
effectually.


350.: THE CASE OF THE NORTH FAMILY
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 29 DEC., 1846, P. 4

Dudley North, as the result of a coach accident, died on 25 Jan., 1845,
leaving a wife, Sarah, and four children, Arabella, Sarah, Dudley, and
Helen. A legal contest arose between Sarah North, the widow, on the one
hand, and her mother-in-law, Mrs. Wilson, and her sister-in-law,
Arabella North, on the other, over the guardianship of the children. The
case, which attracted attention because of the anti-Catholic feeling at
the time, was heard in the Court of Chancery before James Lewis
Knight-Bruce (1791-1866), politician and judge, Vice-Chancellor in the
Court since 1841. Counsel for Sarah North was Thomas Chisholm Anstey
(1816-73). The case was reported in The Times on 21, 22, and 24 Dec.,
1846, but most fully in “In the Matter of the Petition of Arabella
Frances North and Others,” The Times, 23 Dec., 1846, pp. 7-8, from which
the quotations are taken. This unheaded second leader, the sixth of
those on injustice and cruelty jointly authored by Harriet Taylor and
Mill (see No. 303), is described in his bibliography as “A leading
article on the case of the North family in the Vice Chancellor’s Court,
in the Morning Chronicle of 29th December 1846. Very little of this
article was mine.”

(MacMinn, p. 66.)

the case of the north family, heard last week before Vice-Chancellor
Knight Bruce, and on which that judge has pronounced at least a
temporary decision, suggests some queries on the state of the law
respecting maternal rights, to which this judgment, if it represents the
law correctly, gives anything but a satisfactory answer.

The parties to the cause are the widow of Lieut. Dudley North on the one
side, and his mother and sister on the other, and the contest is for the
guardianship of the four children. The facts of the case are these:—The
parents, originally members of the Church of England, had for some time
before the father’s death been in the habit of attending, along with two
of their children, a Roman Catholic chapel, but had not publicly
professed the Catholic religion. The father died from the effects of a
coach accident, and on his death-bed refused to receive the Edition:
current; Page: [1021] Protestant clergyman who had been brought to the
house by one of his relations. The widow soon after became an avowed
Roman Catholic, as she asserts on oath that, according to her belief,
her husband, but for his untimely decease, would have done. The
husband’s relations got possession of the children by a stratagem, and
refused to restore them to their mother, placing them under the care of
a maiden aunt.1 The mother sought legal redress; and the result is, that
the Vice-Chancellor directs a reference to a Master, to appoint a
guardian or guardians, and decides that in the meantime the children
shall remain in the custody of their paternal relations, the mother “to
have access to them for two hours daily,” but only in the presence of
one or more of the said relations.

We have attempted to discover, from the reported judgment, on what
distinct principle this startling decision is founded. Vice-Chancellor
Knight Bruce does not positively affirm any principle, but makes
indistinct reference to two. He is very positive on one thing—that it is
the duty of the court to have the children brought up in the religion of
the Church of England. Sometimes it seems as if his reason was, that the
father must be presumed to have intended it. But there are other sayings
on which it is difficult to put any interpretation but that, even if the
father had intended otherwise, the court would not the less have thought
it its duty to see the children brought up in the religious belief which
this Vice-Chancellor sanctions by his approval.

It is a duty to society that a decision should be given by the highest
authority on this question of law: Is, or is not, a widowed mother, in
case of intestacy, the legal guardian of her children? The counsel for
the widow asserts that she is. The judge, if we understand his meaning,
decides that she is not; that there is no legal guardian; that it rests
with the court to appoint one; that it is entirely at the court’s
discretion to appoint anybody, the mother, or any one else. If this is
correct; if the mother, even when she is the sole parent, is in the eye
of the law a stranger to her own children; if even when the father is
silent the mother has no rights over the children, more than anybody has
who chooses to claim them, and can have no rights unless the court
thinks fit to confer them on her, as it is equally at liberty to do on
any one else—if this is the law, it ought to be made universally known,
in order that the common sense and sense of justice of the community may
speedily put an end to so iniquitous an outrage on the most universally
recognised and strongest tie of nature. Society is rigid in enforcing
this tie against the mother; there are no bounds to its aversion and
contempt for a mother who deserts her offspring; is it then entitled to
arrogate to itself the power to deprive her of them for no presumed or
alleged fault—nay, while saying, as in this case, that the mother’s
conduct is unimpeachable? The idea is monstrous, and repugnant to all
feelings of justice. Again, if the widowed mother is not the legal
guardian of the children, with what justice can she be bound to maintain
Edition: current; Page: [1022] them by her labour? In the case of
mothers in the lower ranks, can the law, which acknowledges between them
and their children no relationship, treat the mother as a parent for the
sole purpose of forcing her to work for their maintenance?

But if the mother is the legal guardian of the children, unless the
court for reasons assigned should appoint otherwise, what reasons appear
in the Vice-Chancellor’s statement which justify his setting aside her
guardianship in this particular case? And here we cannot but express an
opinion that the two reasons between which, as we before observed, the
Vice-Chancellor halts, are each of them so bad, that we do not think he
could have ventured to rest his decision upon the unassisted strength of
either of them. He appears to intend to eke them out, one by another,
under the idea that two bad reasons added together amount to a good one.
In the first place, he argues at some length that the father, having
never professed himself a Catholic, must be held to have died a
Protestant, and to have intended therefore that the children should be
brought up as Protestants. Now, if the mother has no rights, the father
by his intestacy having abdicated his, it seems quite frivolous to
discuss hypotheses about what the father may be presumed to have
intended. The court, on this supposition, is the sole guardian, and
ought to decide the matter on its own merits. But if the mother has
rights, what can be more irrational than to supersede them on a
presumption (not to say on a doubtful one) that the father desired
something different? If he had desired anything different, he could have
so provided by will; and his not doing so must be taken as complete
evidence of his acquiescence in what, he had every reason to believe,
would be the consequence of his intestacy—that the children would remain
in the society and guardianship of their mother. Would the court have
treated the question in this manner if it had been a question of
property? A man dies possessed of an estate, which he could have
bequeathed to whom he pleased; but he dies intestate, and it passes to
the heir-at-law. Would the court receive evidence to prove that he
disliked the heir-at-law, and would have preferred leaving the estate to
some one else? The proposition is absurd, and would be so regarded. The
deceased not having declared his intentions by will, the law would take
its course, and the estate devolve on the person whom it had designated.

While, however, Vice-Chancellor Bruce is willing to make all the use he
can, in favour of his conclusion, of the imaginary intentions of the
father, he intimates the right of the court to direct the children’s
religion, let the father’s purpose be what it may:

That it should view the religion of the children as a matter of
indifference is of course quite out of the question. That no one can do.
That the religion of the children should depend on the mere will and
pleasure of the person or persons who may happen to be guardian or
guardians, especially when there is no testamentary guardian—appears to
me to be equally out of the case. As it is the duty of the court to
superintend the education of infants in all cases where its powers are
not excluded, so especially and most Edition: current; Page: [1023]
importantly it is the duty of the court to superintend that course of
religious education in which the children ought, until they are of years
of discretion, and able to and think fit to choose for themselves, to be
educated.

Not only therefore when there is not, but when there is, a lawful
guardian, the court will not permit the religion of the children to
depend on the guardian’s decision, but will make it depend on the
court’s pleasure. Nor is the maxim limited to cases in which there is no
testamentary guardian. If Mr. North had made a will appointing Mrs.
North guardian, or any one else guardian, and the person appointed had
been supposed to intend to make the children Roman Catholics, the court
would have set aside the will.

Hear this all parents who think that you have the power of confiding
your children after your death to the relatives or friends on whose
integrity, judgment, and affection you most rely. If the friend or
relative be a Roman Catholic, he may be your choice, but some other
person, perhaps one you have the greatest reason to despise and dislike,
will be Sir J.K. Bruce’s. Nay, it is not certain that his interference
will wait for your death. It is his duty, he says, to regulate the
religious education of the children in all cases from which his powers
“are not excluded;” and that they are not excluded from the case of
children whose father is alive, Shelley’s case2 and several other cases
bear witness. For aught that appears, the children might have been taken
out of the control of Mr. North himself, if he had lived to declare
himself a Roman Catholic, and the Protestant maiden lady who has them in
custody might have been in loco of both their parents, as she now is of
their widowed mother. If we could smile on so serious a subject, we
should be moved to do so by the doctrine that a maiden aunt is as nearly
related to children as their mother!

The case has two stages yet to go through. The Master has to report; and
his report, when made, must receive the sanction of the court; from
which, if the present temporary decision is made a permanent one, we
sincerely hope the case will be carried by appeal to the Lord
Chancellor,3 and will not pass by without calling the attention of the
public and of Parliament to the principles which it involves. It is they
who should decide whether a mother is her child’s nearest relation or
no, and whether Sir J.K. Bruce, under cover of his court’s powers as
protector of infants, shall be permitted to commence, in the year 1846,
a new form of religious persecution.4

351.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [40]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 1 JAN., 1847, P. 4

For the context, see No. 306. This unheaded first leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A fortieth leading article on Irish affairs, in
the Morning Chronicle of 1st January 1847”

(MacMinn, p. 66).

as the time approaches when the measures in preparation by Government
for the present relief and future improvement of Ireland must be brought
to maturity, of which measures it is impossible that some plan for the
reclamation of the waste lands should not form an essential part, we
think it useful to continue presenting, from time to time, what occurs
to us on the various points of detail which must be considered in
dealing practically with the subject. We have applied ourselves
particularly to this portion of the great Irish question, not because
any one remedy can possibly suffice to cure evils so inveterate. To give
Ireland a chance of redemption, many beneficent agencies must combine.
But of all improving influences which can be made operative upon the
poorer classes of any people, and especially of a people like the Irish,
the most efficacious are those which grow out of the possession of
property—its actual possession by a class among the labouring people,
and the possibility and hope of it to them all. This, the most powerful
of all instruments of good, next to popular education—and itself better
deserving the name of popular education than much of what now passes by
the name—it is, by a rare concurrence of circumstances, in the power of
Government to confer upon Ireland, almost by an effort of will, with
scarcely more difficulty or embarrassment than it is at any rate
necessitated to encounter for the sake of keeping a whole people from
perishing with famine. Yet this, the most important by far of the
practical questions arising out of the crisis, was the most neglected.
The voices which had made themselves heard on the subject were few and
far between, and no echo had followed. It seemed therefore advisable to
make the more beaten topics of Irish discussion matters of secondary
consideration for a time, and to obtrude perseveringly this great
neglected topic upon those who, in their several capacities, had a voice
in determining the use, or the no-use, which should be made of the
present temporary evil for permanent good.

The question is now, however, in a different position. Sufficient
attention has been directed to it, by ourselves and others, to ensure
its not being passed over unregarded. And, once entertained, the
proposition has so little from which the most timid imagination can
conjure up ideas of danger, while if successful it is so full of the
richest promise of good, that it can scarcely fail to meet with favour,
even if only as an experiment. The chief thing now to be guarded against
is, lest a plan, good in its object and general conception, should
miscarry in the details. Edition: current; Page: [1025] Details are not
here of minor importance. The whole efficacy of the scheme depends on
them. A single point of detail decided the wrong way may be fatal to the
success of the plan. The details are the plan. It would therefore be
neither right to the Government nor to the subject to be backward in
making suggestions because they relate to matters of detail. We do not
offer any suggestions of ours for more than they are worth; they are not
given dogmatically as final, but as hints for consideration. If the
matter were to be decided by those alone who have reflected on it, they
would not require such aid as we can give. But since to be thoroughly
conversant with the principle of a measure is not always one of the
qualifications required from those entrusted with planning or executing
its provisions, it will not do to withhold thoughts which have any
bearing on the subject, under the idea that if really valuable they will
have occurred to some one else.

In a late article we endeavoured to point out the considerations which
should be attended to in fixing the size of peasant properties, and we
expressed an opinion that on the average they should neither exceed nor
fall short of that which will fully occupy and amply remunerate the
labour of the proprietor himself and of his family.1 It seems necessary
to add, in explanation, that in suggesting this standard for the average
we do not propose that each individual allotment should be made to
conform to it. It is, on the contrary, extremely desirable that there
should be considerable inequality and diversity among the allotments, in
order that there may be peasant proprietors of different grades.
Complete equality is only a school of improvement where there is already
a strong habitual sentiment of emulation. A multitude of persons
occupied exactly alike, all equally well off, and having nobody near who
is superior or dissimilar to them, do not improve. Each is confirmed in
his own habits by seeing precisely the same habits prevailing all around
him. It is not enough that the day labourer aspires to be a proprietor;
the man of five acres should aspire to be the proprietor of ten, the man
of ten to fifteen or more. The largest size (whatever it be) that a
family can properly manage without assistance should be the most usual
size of an allotment, but there should also be many smaller and some
larger. The best mode of providing for these diversities will soon be
discovered by experience, if the executive functionaries are competent
to their task. Possibly no more recondite contrivance may be requisite
than that of allotting to each selected family as much land as it can
bring into a certain prescribed completeness of cultivation within a
given time. The different energy and ability of different cultivators
would hardly fail to produce as much inequality of possessions as is
desirable, and this without departing from the general principle
previously laid down, since those capable of reclaiming more would be
capable of managing more without calling in the aid of hired labour.

Another point ought not to be overlooked. In every plan which has to do
with Irish labourers the obstacle is—too little ambition, too few wants;
the danger that they will be satisfied with a bare subsistence, and will
prefer rags, a turf cabin, and idleness, to comfort with labour. When a
people of this character is discovered in the South Sea islands or on
the African coast, our merchants and navigators excite new wants by
placing suitable objects before their eyes. The new colonists must have
objects before their eyes sufficiently attractive to be worth working
for. Comforts and conveniences must be shown to them—must be brought
within easy reach. Many of the tracts now waste, and capable of being
colonised, are at a great distance from any existing town or village. In
planting these tracts with settlers, it is proper to do what is always
done in America—to lay out villages or towns at suitable distances. In
these, artisans would settle and shops establish themselves; the peasant
proprietors would find a market for surplus produce, and facilities for
converting the proceeds into articles of comfort and convenience. Roads
should be made, from the very first, to connect these villages with the
country round and with the more distant centres of civilization.
Individual exertion might here co-operate very usefully with the plans
of Government. A society for the improvement of Ireland could hardly
find a more useful employment of funds than to establish depôts in
convenient situations, where the various things for which it is useful
there should be a demand among the peasantry might be provided, and kept
constantly in their sight; tools of good construction; seeds suited for
various kinds of culture; useful books, good and cheap clothing, solid
and useful utensils, and articles of furniture. There might even be
established with great advantage (if the term may be permitted)
itinerant bazaars of all sorts of articles, at once useful to the
peasantry and within their capacities of purchase. A philanthropic
society could afford to wait for its reimbursement until a demand had
been raised up by its own continued exertions; which, considering all
the uncertainties of the case, could hardly be expected from individual
capitalists.


352.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [41]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 4 JAN., 1847, P. 4

Charles Edward Trevelyan (1807-86), Assistant Secretary to the Treasury
since 1840, was one of the principal administrators of relief in
Ireland. On 15 Dec., 1846, he had written a letter to the Board of
Public Works explaining and amplifying a Treasury Minute of 1 Dec. that
allowed relief money to be borrowed by individual landowners for
reclaiming waste lands (see PP, 1847, LVI, 365). Both the Minute and the
letter were published in the Irish news of the Morning Chronicle on 21
Dec., 1846, pp. 2-3, from which Mill quotes. For the context of the
series, see No. 306. This unheaded first leader is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “A forty first leading article on Irish affairs, in the
Morning Chronicle of 4 Jany 1847”

(MacMinn, p. 66).

Edition: current; Page: [1027]
while the government are understood to be preparing, among other
measures of Irish improvement, a general plan for the reclamation of
waste lands, in which the claims of the peasantry to receive some share
in the common inheritance of the whole nation are not overlooked;1 this
purpose, if really entertained, is in danger of being defeated, and the
whole question conclusively prejudged, through the operation—we hope,
the unintended operation—of the Treasury minute communicated to the
Board of Works in Mr. Trevelyan’s letter of the 15th of last month.

There have been three stages in the arrangements of Government for
suppying food and employment to the destitute Irish people. In the first
stage all the employment was on public works. The extent of the calamity
was not then known. It was expected, doubtless, that the public would
have only to feed a small fraction of the poor population, not (as in
some counties it has proved) nearly the whole. Still less was it
anticipated that Government pay and Government employment would draw off
the people from productive occupations, and that there would be little
other work done this year, in the west of Ireland, than what the public
might provide. The public believed itself to be supplying an addition to
the ordinary labours of the season, not a substitute for them; and was
startled on finding that while wages were to be got for breaking stones
and cutting down hills, ploughing and sowing were forgotten, and that a
year hence, if there were no change of measures, Ireland would have
roads, but no bread.

As soon as the number of destitute applicants for employment was seen to
be what it was, the folly and danger of wasting all this labour on
things of very secondary usefulness, or none at all, was promptly
recognized; and Mr. Labouchere’s letter permitted the landlords, in
“presentment sessions,” to apply for public money to be expended in
drainage and other agricultural improvements, provided they were willing
to assess themselves as a body for the ultimate repayment of the
advance.2 This was the second stage of the Government measures; and from
this revised version of their original policy much was at first
expected. Little followed, however, except complaint and remonstrance.
The landlords would not consent to a collective assessment. They felt it
unjust that they, residing in the country, and contributing, as many of
them did, to the mitigation of the distress by employing much labour,
should be taxed as highly for the improvement of lands not their own, as
the absentee or the niggard who relieved and employed nobody. They
clamoured, therefore, for the adoption of some rule or principle by
which, as nearly as possible, the repayment of each advance should be
charged upon the person benefited by it; which, they said, would be the
case if the assessment was made by townlands, instead of Edition:
current; Page: [1028] baronies or electoral districts, each of the small
divisions called townlands being generally the property of a single
proprietor. While this demand was urged from all parts of Ireland,
hardly any use was made of the provisions of Mr. Labouchere’s letter;
few or no reproductive works were presented, and the wasteful road
expenditure continued and continues as before.

It is apparently to meet these difficulties that the Government, by the
Treasury minute of the 1st of December, gave another revised and
corrected edition of their policy, constituting the third stage. By this
resolution the Government undertake, among other things, to lend money
to individual landlords for improvements recommended by the Board of
Works. The words to which we now allude in the Treasury minute are
these:

Proceeding to the consideration of the second class of enactments—i.e.,
1 and 2 Wm. IV, c. 33, s. 32, and 9 & 10 Vic., c. 1, s. 6—under which
loans may be made to individuals, to enable them to effect the
improvement of their estates for themselves, by drainage, reclaiming
waste lands, or other works of substantial improvement, my lords are
prepared to make advances to proprietors who comply with the conditions
of the 1st and 2d Wm. IV, c. 33, amended by 9 & 10 Vic., c. 1, s. 6, as
to the nature of the works, and who can obtain from a competent person,
approved by the Board of Works, the certificate of increased value to be
given to the land improved, as prescribed by that act. . . . Their
lordships, however, desire that it may be understood that parties
applying for loans under any of the enactments above adverted to, must
undertake to submit to such terms, in respect to the period of
repayment, and such other provisions, as Parliament may hereafter enact.

[P. 3.]

Since this resolution was promulgated, the landlords have been quite
tranquil, as was very natural, having obtained all they desired; and the
public have rather approved than blamed the measure. It was regarded as
a help to the landlords for increasing the produce of the country,
employing labourers, and ultimately improving the value of their own
estates; and though every one felt that the landlords had not deserved,
and could not claim public aid in thus enriching themselves, it was
acquiesced in, because the public welfare demanded that the cultivated
surface of Ireland should be rendered more productive, and there seemed
no means by which lands already occupied and tilled could be reached for
the purpose of improvement, unless through the instrumentality, and to a
certain extent for the profit, of their owners.

But while attention was fixed upon this, the leading and only ostensible
feature of the plan, it at first escaped most people (including, we
confess, ourselves) that the Treasury minute contained three words,
“reclaiming waste lands,” which, if acted up to, surrendered
gratuitously to the landlords, not only all the increased value which is
to be given by State money to what are properly their own lands, the
lands which they have in cultivation, but also the whole value (after
payment of expenses) which may be given by similar means to the entire
waste lands of Ireland. This was overlooked here; but it has not been
overlooked by those who were to profit by it. At the Frenchpark
presentment sessions, in the county of Edition: current; Page: [1029]
Roscommon, on the 26th of last month, Mr. Fitzstephen French announced
that his brother, Lord de Freyne, “on Monday, would apply, under the
minute, for a sum of £24,000, to commence the drainage and reclaiming of
his extensive wastes in this barony, the total cost of which could not
be less than about £150,000.”3 The following memorial from Lord de
Freyne to the Board of Works has since been made public:


The Memorial of the Right Hon. Lord de Freyne

Sheweth—

That he, with other estates, is tenant for life of extensive waste lands
specified in the schedule annexed hereto, situated in the barony
Frenchpark, and county Roscommon: that he is desirous of affording
employment to the people resident on his estate, by draining,
gravelling, and improving the said waste lands; and that he desires,
under the powers vested in the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland,
advances of money may be made to him for that purpose; that 4,275 acres
are fit for immediate drainage, gravelling, and reclaiming—and that the
estimated expense would amount to £14,716; that memorialist has also
6,669 acres of deep and wet bog adjoining the aforesaid wastes, which
the construction of roads and opening of drains would consolidate and
make fit for reclamation; that the expense of doing this would amount to
£7,671, showing a total expenditure of £24,164; that the estimated
increase of value in these lands, when so improved, is £3,000 per annum;
that the calculations of the persons employed by memorialist are
supported, both in the cost of execution of works, and the return
therefrom, by the reports made by the Bog Commissioners, and printed by
order of the House of Commons, in 1814; that the said advance of £24,164
is intended to cover the whole expense of the proposed works; that
memorialist undertakes to submit to such terms in respect to the period
of repayment, and such other provisions, as Parliament may hereafter
enact.

De Freyne.

We cannot believe that this result was foreseen, or that any measure
leading to it has been deliberately adopted, or will be persevered in by
Government. Of all modes ever suggested for dealing with the waste
lands, this is the most unjustifiable. What have the Irish landlords
done, that the State should double or quadruple their rental for them?
Is it not enough that they are to reap the whole benefit of the
expenditure which the State, not for their sake, but for that of the
starving people, is willing to incur in increasing the value of their
old lands? Must it also reclaim the unoccupied soil of Ireland from the
worthlessness and barrenness in which they have left it, merely to
present it to them? Far better were it that the land should remain as it
is, and wait for more propitious times and wiser counsels, than that
this rare and unequalled opportunity of rooting out the pestilent tenure
which is the chief social cause of Ireland’s degradation should be
thrown away irrevocably, and that five years hence, instead of a
peasantry Edition: current; Page: [1030] composed of a fourth or a fifth
landed proprietors, and the remainder labourers at good wages, nothing
should have issued for Ireland’s benefit from this great crisis of her
destiny, except merely a larger surface covered with miserable cottiers!


353.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [42]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 6 JAN., 1847, P. 4

Mill here defends his article on the Treasury Minute (No. 352) against
criticisms in a leading article in the Globe and Traveller, 5 Jan.,
1847, p. 2, from which the quotations are taken. For the context of the
series, see No. 306. This unheaded leader is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “A forty second leading article on Irish affairs, in the
Morning Chronicle of 6th Jany 1847. (The second leader).”

(MacMinn, p. 66.)

the globe of yesterday evening has put forth an answer to our
observations on Monday respecting the Treasury minute of the 1st of
December, as connected with the question of waste lands. The Globe would
be “extremely sorry to have to acknowledge the correctness of the
opinion” that the forthcoming measure of the Government is in danger of
being defeated, and the whole question prejudged, by the offer so
bountifully made to lend the money of the State to any landlord who
chooses to reclaim waste land, and is willing to pledge his estate for
the repayment. We should rejoice to think that there was no ground for
this apprehension; but the article of the Globe has certainly no
tendency to reassure us; for though the writer commences as if he meant
to affirm that the consequence anticipated will not take place, the
whole drift of his article is, to justify it if it does take place, and
even to make out that the Government will be greatly to blame if it does
not.

The point is—shall Government take measures for reclaiming the waste
land in such a way that the whole value given to the land by public
money shall be made a present of to the landlords? On this the Globe
says, it will not be a present, for the waste land, belonging to them by
law, is as much theirs as the cultivated land. Be it so. And the owner
has “an equal right to invest his capital in adding value” to the waste
land as to the cultivated land. True. And as much right to borrow for
the one as for the other purpose. True again; but who questions or
obstructs his right? Let him borrow; but why is the State obliged to
lend? “Nor, to carry the principle to the full extent of the case, do we
see why the reception of a loan from the State should be held to affect
his right to the increased value.” Such is the last step in this ladder
of propositions, and a most astounding step it is.

The Globe should really reconsider the subject, and think twice before
determining to stand to this doctrine. Will any one admit as a
principle, that Edition: current; Page: [1031] whatever A has a right to
do without asking leave from B, he has a right to B’s unconditional
assistance in doing? Or that because A has a right to do as he pleases
with his own, and to borrow if he can whatever he is able to pay, this
constitutes the smallest approach to a reason, as respects B, why he
should become the lender? Is any one, either Government or private
person, under an obligation to lend money for the purpose of enriching
another? Besides, a Government has properly no money. Its money is the
money of the public, and is neither to be given nor lent for any reason
but the public good, nor in any manner but the manner most conducive to
it. One would imagine that the State kept a shop for lending money, and
was glad to do any little job in the way of business, without asking
questions. On the contrary, lending money is a thing entirely foreign to
the usual business and functions of a State; a most exceptional
transaction, justifiable only as a means to some public benefit of a
high order, not to be attained otherwise; and as it would be the height
of impudence in any individual or any class to say to the Government,
Lend us public money for our convenience, it would also be the grossest
dereliction of duty in the Government to do so, unless it had
ascertained that no other mode of employing the money would produce so
much public benefit.

We could understand, though we should marvel at, any one who should say,
that the money which Government may bestow would be more beneficially
employed in improving the land for the landlords than in improving it
for the people. But the Globe says the direct contrary. It expressly
allows, that “if the Government improved the land, it would make the
better disposal of it by dividing it into small farms, instead of
continuing the cottier and conacre system,” which our contemporary
calls, in as strong language as any we have used, a “vile system.” And
does this make scarcely any difference? Does the public good indeed
count for so little? Is it so new a thing to consider great social
objects and the welfare of a people, in a question about land, that such
considerations are not allowed even to turn the scale—are not suffered
to outweigh a fanciful claim of men, who have made no use of the land
for twenty generations, to be the only persons whom the State shall help
to make use of it now! Men who, in any newly formed colony, would have
been ousted of their land if it had remained unused for as many years as
it now has centuries. Can any one wonder at Socialism, or Communism,
after this? Can we be surprised that men should be found who
passionately reject and denounce the principle of property, when we see
into what a base superstition the worship of it has grown—how it deadens
men’s minds to the ends for which property exists, erecting property
itself into an end—and how intellects fit for better things are held in
bondage by the mere name, though the idea which it ought to represent be
absent!

The second argument of the Globe is an extremely original one. You
object, it says, to bestowing on the landlord the whole value given to
the land by Edition: current; Page: [1032] reclaiming it at the public
expense; this, however, you are bound to do; for you admit, and so does
every one, that property ought not to be taken away without
compensation; though the land lie waste, the landlord is entitled to its
present value; and its present value is the same thing as its future
value when improved, minus the expenses. How this should be is rather
difficult to conceive. The Globe, therefore, illustrates it by an
example. If Lord De Freyne, whose application to Government we noticed
on Monday, be right in his estimate,

his land is of such a nature that for every pound he may now spend upon
it he is sure to receive about four in return. . . . Now, either his
lordship is right as to the value of his land, or he is wrong. . . . If
he is wrong, then the State, by lending him what he asks for, will not
“make him a present of £2,150 a-year for ever.”. . . If he is right, his
interest in those 10,900 acres of land is now fairly worth (to anybody
who has £25,000 to spare for its improvement) some 60 or 70,000 pounds;
for as land has recently sold in Ireland, if taken into the market when
improved, with an annual value of £3,000, it should not bring much less
than £100,000.

So that compensation for the present value of the land could not be made
to Lord De Freyne (if his calculations are right), unless he were paid
£60,000, or £70,000.

Now, does any human being believe that if Lord De Freyne’s waste, or the
waste of any other Irish landlord who allowed it to remain a waste,
could have been sold for £60,000, it would have been unsold to this day?
Have so needy a class possessed a valuable commodity of great value for
all these generations, and never sold it? The dilemma of the Globe will
not hold. He argues that either the land when reclaimed will not yield a
net profit of £60,000, or if it will, it can be sold for something
approaching to that amount now. But everybody knows that waste land in
Ireland cannot now be sold for anything more than a trifling price, and
that this is no argument at all against its capacity to be made valuable
by improvement. Persons who have large sums to buy land with, and large
sums to sink in improving it, and who are willing to adventure all this
upon the chances of an agricultural enterprise in the most lawless parts
of Ireland, are not abundant. Has it not been a complaint and
lamentation as far back as any one living can remember, that because of
Whiteboyism, or O’Connellism, or the priests, or the Repealers, or some
other small fragment of the mass of social evil which presses upon
Ireland, capital will not go thither to find employment, although there
is a fairer field for it than in almost any other part of the British
dominions? If Lord De Freyne can sell his land at what it would be worth
under a good Government and in the midst of a pacific and industrious
people, in Heaven’s name let him; but if he cannot, the Government is
not to pay him that price for it. The Government is only bound to give
him what he could get for it now, or the equivalent in money of any
benefit he now derives from it, whichever of the two is most to his
advantage. Government does not want his land if he is prepared to
improve it himself, or to borrow from any other quarter Edition:
current; Page: [1033] to improve it. But if he can do neither,
Government, instead of lending him money to improve it, has a right to
take it at its present value; and it rests with Government to create, in
and by means of it, a higher value for the benefit, first and
preferably, of the Irish people, and if not for them, for the State; for
any one rather than for the landlord.


354.: THE CONDITION OF IRELAND [43]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 7 JAN., 1847, P. 4

The evening Globe and Traveller responded in a leading article of 6
Jan., p. 2, to the Morning Chronicle leader on the Treasury Minute (No.
353), of the same day. The quotations are from the Globe’s leader of 6
Jan., except as indicated. Though Mill continued to write leaders for
the Morning Chronicle on Ireland into April of 1847, this unheaded
leader is the last of the series on Irish land that began on 5 Oct.,
1846, with No. 306. It is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A forty
third leading article on Irish affairs, in the Morning Chronicle of 7th
Jany 1847”

(MacMinn, p. 67).

we earnestly hope that the rejoinder of the Globe to our yesterday’s
article has not correctly stated or surmised the intentions of
Government on the question of the waste lands. For if so, the
forthcoming measure1 will indeed, truly enough, not be thwarted and
nullified by the operation of the Treasury minute, but only because the
principle of the Treasury minute, if the Globe be rightly informed, is
itself the principle of the measure.

The doctrine which the Globe lays down, and which it supposes to be
adopted by the Government is this: That the money which the State
disburses for the employment of the people ought all to pass through the
hands of the landlords, up to the point at which the landlords will not
accept any more. When the landlords have had all that they will consent
to take, it is supposed “that there will yet be men with idle hands and
empty stomachs, with none to employ and feed them,” and that the State
having done its very utmost to bribe other people to employ them without
effect, will be driven, “as a necessary evil,” to employ them itself.
Under these painful circumstances, the State, it is conceded, might as
well employ them in converting such waste land as the landlords may have
spared into small farms, which, however, when fit for cultivation, are
to be sold by auction, so that if the scheme does introduce any small
proprietors, they will not be peasants, and probably not Irishmen. We
have written to very little purpose for months past if it is necessary
for us to waste any more argument upon a scheme which makes no pretence
of doing anything to amend the landed tenure or the agricultural system
of Ireland. It is a mere expedient for the emergency, with no Edition:
current; Page: [1034] attempt at permanent social improvement; and if
such be the plan propounded by Government and adopted by Parliament,
there is nothing left but to mourn over an opportunity lost, never to be
recovered.

The Globe charges us, though with perfect amenity, and doing us the full
justice which we sincerely reciprocate, with a palpable misconception of
its arguments; but it does not state what it is which we have
misconceived. It restates one argument, which we certainly did not
misstate, but, as we candidly confess, passed over entirely—“the
peculiar value of individual agency, and the danger and difficulty
attending all official interference, however well contrived, with either
the agriculture or the commerce of the country.”2 Individual agency, no
doubt, is generally (though not always) more efficient and economical
than Government agency. But it does not follow that we should employ
individual agency for what we do not want, in preference to Government
agency for what we do want. If all that is wanted is mere temporary
employment for the people, nothing more needs be said. Worse cannot be
said, and we will think nothing so bad of a Liberal Ministry, until
facts compel us to it. But if it is desired to reform the industrial
system of the country, and raise the permanent condition and character
of the people, the individual agency of the landlords will not do this
at all; and the question, therefore, whether Government or individuals
would do it best, is at least superfluous. The Globe tries a little to
maintain that the landlords will surely do away with the “vile” cottier
system, because it is in the end as unprofitable to them as degrading to
the peasantry. The system “is not now willingly continued by any of that
class of Irish landlords who are likely now to sink capital in the
improvement of their estates.”3 Perhaps not by those who sink their own
capital; but sinking the capital of the State is another matter. We
hardly know what landlord, who has any wastes pronounced improvable by
the Board of Works, is likely to refuse an unlimited offer of public
money for accomplishing a transaction so profitable to himself. But
grant the landlords willing to get rid of cottiers, how will they set
about it? Will they make the tenants proprietors? No one supposes that
they will hear patiently of such a thing. Will they even make them hired
labourers? Then the public must find capital for that too. What remains
but to fix them on the soil as cottiers, like their fathers before them.

But, further, it is yet to be shown that individual agency will have one
particle more to do, or that Government agency will have less, on the
plan which the Globe patronizes, than on one directed to nobler and
larger objects. Government does not intend to leave everything to be
done by the landlords which is done for the landlords’ profit. The
Treasury minute tells them what they are expected to do, and what the
State will do for them. The State undertakes the general Edition:
current; Page: [1035] drainage of the country. It consents to deepen the
larger watercourses, and provide great conduits for carrying off all
waters which will flow or can be guided into them. Now this, which it
must necessarily do for the great landlords, since they cannot
themselves combine to do it, is almost all that it needs necessarily do
for the poor peasants, since it is the only thing which peasants cannot
possibly do for themselves. No doubt the drainage would, in that case,
require to be extended into more numerous and smaller ramifications; but
the arrangements which must be made and the machinery which must be
erected for the one purpose would suffice for the other; and the whole
would be better done, and perhaps even more economically, if done under
one general systematic supervision.

The Globe fights us with an argumentum ad hominem, asking how we can
object to making the landlords a present of the value which is to be
given by public money to the waste, when we do not object to lending
them money for the improvement of their cultivated lands, and how we can
make any distinction between the two cases? We can easily satisfy our
contemporary on this point. In the first place, it is not we who ever
advocated loans to the landlords, even for their cultivated lands. We
have acquiesced because there was no help for it. Making a present to
the landlords is to our minds what making a present to the peasantry is
to our contemporary—a “necessary evil.” And, like him, we would have
nothing to do with it unless it is necessary. Our own opinion is, that
the whole of the Government expenditure should be directed, in the first
instance, to the waste lands. But since there might be a greater number
of persons to employ than could be usefully set to work at one and the
same time in reclaiming the waste, we have no objection to employing the
remainder in improving the cultivated land, even though this can only be
done by lending to the landlords. The distinction we make between the
cultivated and the waste land is simply that the State can give the one
to the peasantry, and cannot the other. Of course, in abstract justice,
it could do both, making due compensation, as in the common case of
making a railroad; but the one would be an extreme assertion of an
acknowledged right, the other a very temperate one, and we are content
with the moderate measure.


355.: THE QUARTERLY REVIEW ON FRENCH AGRICULTURE [1]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 9 JAN., 1847, P. 4

This article is the first of a series of four that appeared in the
Morning Chronicle (see Nos. 356-8) in response to John Wilson Croker,
“Agriculture in France—Division of Property,” Quarterly Review, LXXIX
(Dec. 1846), 202-38. Croker was reviewing favourably De l’agriculture en
France, d’après les documents officiels, 2 vols. (Paris: Guillaumin,
1846), by the royalist and intensely conservative French economist
Maurice Edition: current; Page: [1036] Rubichon (1766-1849) and his
nephew L. Mounier, an engineer, his frequent literary collaborator.
Mill’s mistrust of this book is seen in a letter to Chadwick of 19 Nov.,
1847: “What I thought about Rubichon’s book I have said in the Morning
Chronicle of the 9th, 11th, 13th & 16th of last January. It is I think
right that the author of the article [an unidentified article on
Rubichon] should see those papers, & should be aware of the facts &
books there cited.” (EL, CW, Vol. XIII, p. 724.) The letter continues
with a reference to more information Mill had gathered about the French
population that further weakened Rubichon’s case. (See CW, Vol. II, pp.
288n-9n, where Mill uses the new figures.)

This article, an unheaded first leader, is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “A first leading article in reply to the Quarterly
Review on French Agriculture, in the Morning Chronicle of 9th Jany.
1847” (MacMinn, p. 67).

About the time of writing these articles Mill resumed work on his
Principles of Political Economy, completing the first draft in March
(Bain, John Stuart Mill, p. 87). He incorporated most of the final three
articles in the series in an Appendix to Volume I, and commented to Bain
on 27 Jan.: “I have so indoctrinated the Chronicle writers with my ideas
on Ireland, that they are now going on very well and spiritedly without
me, which enables me to work much at the Political Economy, to my own
satisfaction. The last thing I did for the Chronicle was a thorough
refutation, in three long articles, of Croker’s article on the Division
of Property in France.” (EL, CW, Vol. XIII, p. 707.) Mill’s slip in
mentioning three rather than four articles may indicate that he had
already decided to use the three in the Principles. In the Appendix, the
extracts are introduced by an explanatory note: “In 1846 there appeared
an elaborate treatise,* by two authors, MM. Mounier and Rubichon, the
latter of whom was by his own statement a public functionary for ten
years preceding the French Revolution, and both appear to take their
ideas of a wholesome state of society from the institutions and
practices of the Middle Ages. In this book it is maintained, that while
French writers and administrators are in a conspiracy to represent their
country as making rapid strides in prosperity, the progress of the
morcellement is in fact reducing it to beggary. An imposing array of
official details, adduced in apparent support of this assertion, gave a
degree of weight to it which it could not claim from any correctness of
information or capacity of judgment shown by its authors. Their work was
cried up as a book of authority by the Quarterly Review,† in an article
which excited some notice by proclaiming, on the evidence produced by
these writers, that ‘in a few years the Code Napoleon will be employed
in dividing fractions of square inches of land, and deciding by
logarithms infinitesimal inheritances.’ As such representations ought
not to be without a permanent answer, I think it worth while to subjoin
the substance of three articles in the Morning Chronicle, containing as
complete a refutation of these writers and of their reviewer, partly
from their own materials, as appears to be either merited or required.”
(CW, Vol. II, p. 433.) The text of that Appendix was printed from a
manuscript consisting of pasted-up clippings from the Morning Chronicle,
with the introductory comment and linking passages added in ink (all on
rectos), and notes added in ink (on versos); occasionally alterations
are made in ink on the clippings themselves. (For full description, see
CW, Vol. III, p. 1129.) The variants between the original versions and
the manuscript of the Principles are given in notes to Nos. 356-8 below,
in which “MS” indicates the manuscript of the Principles. (Alterations
in later editions of the Principles, indicated in CW, Vol. II, are not
here given.)

Edition: current; Page: [1037]
the number of the Quarterly Review just published contains a
dissertation on the division of property in France, avowedly intended as
a manifesto against peasant proprietors. The article is a mere abstract
of a recent work on the state of French agriculture, by MM. Mounier and
Rubichon, written for the purpose of showing that all French statesmen
and administrators are in an unintentional conspiracy to represent their
country as rapidly advancing in prosperity, when, on the contrary, it is
sinking lower every day, morally and physically, through the progressive
division of landed property, and is now not far from starvation point,
which it will not fail speedily to reach. These dismal predictions,
ushered in by an imposing array of statistical details, cannot but
produce some effect on those who are ignorant of the subject, and have
no time to inquire into it. We expect to find the Quarterly largely
drawn upon in the approaching discussions concerning Ireland, and the
Globe of Thursday has already commenced pelting us with M. Rubichon.1 We
desire no better than to try conclusions with that gentleman and his
copyists; and before we have done, our readers will be able to judge for
themselves on which side the truth lies. But though quite ready to
encounter the assailants of peasant properties on French ground, we
cannot consent to stake our cause on that issue. If the condition of
France under her present laws were ever so disastrous, it would prove
nothing against what is proposed for Ireland, as will appear from three
several reasons:

First: The state of France is a state of compulsory division. The French
law, by an inexorable rule, parcels out every inheritance equally among
the children, recognizing in the parent no power either of bequest or of
gift beyond the amount of one child’s portion.2 No one, that we are
aware of, proposes to import this law into Great Britain or Ireland. If
under such a law peasant properties are too minutely subdivided, can
there be a more complete non sequitur than to infer that they would be
so if things were left to their natural course? It is true, division of
the inheritance does not necessarily imply division of the land; and
accordingly the Quarterly reviewer does not make out his case even
against the French law, as we shall presently show from his own facts.
But when the sole option is between dividing the land and selling it to
share the proceeds, it will often be divided in cases in which, if there
had been a power of bequest, the foreseeing prudence of the parent would
have provided otherwise. When a testator knows that the sub-division of
his land will diminish its produce, and leave his family impoverished,
he has a strong motive to guard against this result by either
bequeathing it in joint-tenancy (if that be legally in his power), or
giving the whole to one child, with legacies charged on it for the
remainder.

Secondly: France is not, like Ireland, a country of large properties,
among Edition: current; Page: [1038] which it is proposed to introduce
an infusion of small ones, but a country in which the great majority of
the population are small proprietors. The argument from France therefore
can by no means be transferred to a country for which nothing analogous
to this is proposed, or to be expected. It is quite possible that a
country entirely cut up into small properties might be as badly off as
is pretended, while small properties duly intermixed with large might be
the very beau idéal of agriculture. Large properties have their
characteristic advantages as well as small; and it is as ill to be
without one as the other. Not that France is without large properties;
there has been as much exaggeration on this as on every other point of
the case. The portion of the productive soil of France which is
cultivated by the proprietors (teste the Quarterly) is considerably less
than half, being fifty millions of English acres out of 114. Still there
must be many large districts in which small peasant proprietors occupy
the whole land, and have no example near them of more skilful or more
successful cultivation to stimulate their ambition and correct their
prejudices. The examples cited unfavourable to peasant properties will
be found generally, if not always, to be of this kind.

But, thirdly, what would it avail could it even be proved that the
subdivision of farms, if left to itself, would be indefinite—that (as
the Quarterly says) “in a few years the Code Napoleon will be employed
in dividing fractions of square inches of land, and deciding by
logarithms infinitesimal inheritances.”3 Cannot the law stop this
subdivision at whatever point it thinks fit? If peasant properties when
of a certain size are a valuable feature in the condition of a people,
and only threaten to be otherwise when they become too small, cannot the
law determine how small it will allow them to be? This is actually done
by some of the German Governments. Bavaria and Nassau have laws fixing a
minimum of subdivision, and the Prussian Government proposed a similar
law to the provincial states of its Rhenish provinces (where the Code
Napoleon is still in force), by whom, however, it was rejected. It is
not statesmanlike, nor hardly candid, to confound subdivision with
unlimited subdivision, and argue as if a State could not make room
within its boundaries for an unquestionable good, without allowing that
good to be perverted at the pleasure of individuals into an indefinite
amount of evil.

This is a valid answer to the Quarterly and the Globe, but not to MM.
Mounier and Rubichon. Those writers enjoy the full advantage which
extreme opinions give, in being invulnerable against many attacks which
fall heavy on those who keep any terms with common sense. It is not too
minute subdivision which they complain of, but any subdivision. The
evil, according to them, dates from the middle ages, and the irreparable
error consisted in allowing any portion whatever of the feudal domains
to be divided or alienated. They avow the opinion, that there has been
no good agriculture in Europe except by a territorial nobility or by the
monastic orders, and that no country need expect to have a good
agriculture Edition: current; Page: [1039] hereafter, unless by the same
means.4 The Quarterly therefore throws MM. Mounier and Rubichon
overboard, saying “The bias on the minds of these gentlemen against all
the results of the Revolution is so strong, and often so unreasonable,
that we should set no great value on their individual speculations or
opinions, from which we differ in many essential points—and more
especially from those of M. Rubichon, in whose generally too favourable
statements of the condition and policy of England we should have much to
rectify.”5

This is as much as the Quarterly could be expected to say. The fact is,
that it is impossible for an educated Englishman, whatever may be his
opinions, to read with gravity these gentlemen’s assertions about
England. Since the famous General Pillet there has been nothing so
impayable.6 The aplomb with which in every chapter they deliver, as
certified and admitted facts, things which they have either dreamed or
been mystified about by some cruel jester, must be seen to be believed.
We hope their countrymen will not be misled by the pretension they keep
up through the whole book of knowing all about England. The safest rule
for a French reader would be, to disbelieve indiscriminately whatever
they state is a positive fact, whether of the nature of compliment or
censure. In this country it will be evident to whoever reads the book
itself, that any statement resting on the authority of MM. Mounier and
Rubichon might as well rest on nothing at all; and that the sole value
of the book consists in the official documents, and other statements by
more competent judges, of which the greater part of it is made up.

In this respect, however, it is extremely important. It reduces to a
manageable compass and an intelligible order much of the information
contained in the statistical account of France, compiled and published
by the present French Government—probably the most valuable record ever
made of the existing condition of a great nation.7 It is creditable to
the good faith of these writers (which indeed we should not think of
questioning), that their own materials afford the means of overthrowing
many of their conclusions. As for their reviewer in the Quarterly, he
knows, if we will take his word for it, the opinions and sentiments of
“every wise man in France,” and particularly of “the wisest of them all,
Louis Philippe;”8 but he knows nothing whatever of his subject except
what he learns from his authors, and shows so little capacity of
understanding even that, that his instructors have reason to be ashamed
of him. But the exposure of his blunders must be deferred until we have
more space for it.

356.: THE QUARTERLY REVIEW ON FRENCH AGRICULTURE [2]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 11 JAN., 1847, P. 4

For an account of the origin, text, and variants in this second in a
series of four leaders responding to the praise of Mounier and Rubichon
by Croker in the Quarterly Review, see No. 355. The unheaded first
leader is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A second leading article
in reply to the Quarterly Review, on French agriculture, in the Morning
Chronicle of 11th January 1847” (MacMinn, p. 67). In the letter to
Chadwick quoted in the headnote to No. 355, Mill remarks that the author
of the unknown article “will easily detect one error in the second
article of the Chronicle, into which the Quarterly reviewer misled me.
But it does not touch the main question.” (P. 724.) (The error—corrected
in the Principles—was in following Croker, who copied the error from
Mounier and Rubichon, p. 101, in estimating the increase in properties
that paid land-tax at 60,000 rather than 600,000; see variants e-e, f-f,
and g-g.)

we trust that in examining the evidence produced by the Quarterly Review
of the dangers which threaten France from the excessive and
progressively increasing subdivision of landed property, we shall not be
thought to be demanding the attention of English readers to a thing
which does not concern them. The question is not of mere local interest.
It is not a French, nor solely an Irish question. It is the question,
whether the labouring classes of a country are improved or deteriorated
in condition by possessing property. For hitherto land is the only
property which they have ever been able, as a body, to retain
permanently. It is less liable than any other to be lost by
vicissitudes; it inspires a stronger attachment, and greater habits of
providence; and a much smaller amount of saving is sufficient, when laid
out in land, to enable a labouring family to subsist and to be
independent. Whoever is interested in the great question of the time,
the condition of the labouring classes, is proportionally concerned that
false notions on such a subject should not become generally accredited.

aThe reviewer makes an extraordinary slip at the threshold of his
subject, in estimating the extent to which the morcellement has actually
proceeded. He finds it stated,1 that among nearly five millions and a
half of landed proprietors there are 2,600,000 the revenue of whose
land, as rated to the land-tax, does not exceed forty shillings, which
sum, he very candidly says, should rather be sixty, as the rated value
is very much lower than the real value. On this he exclaims, “There
already exist in France millions of examples that a propriétaire may be
poorer than a peasant. . . . 2,600,000 families, comprising 13,000,000
persons, of each of which families the rated income does not exceed
forty shillings, but say sixty shillings, sterling, for the maintenance
of five persons—and these are Edition: current; Page: [1041]
proprietors! The poorest day labourer would earn four times as much.”2
He seems actually to suppose that these small proprietors, like great
landlords, live only upon the rent of their land, forgetting that they
have its whole produce. He might have known from the very documents he
has quoted, and might have guessed if he had not known, that the forty
shillings at which the land is rated in the bcollectors’b books are not
the gross produce of the little estate, but its net produce, the surplus
beyond the expenses of cultivation, which expenses include the
subsistence of the cultivators, together with interest on the capital.
The reviewer himself shows that the rated revenue of all the landed
property of France is about 4 per cent. of its rated value, and does not
therefore much exceed a reasonable rent.3 A writer who can mistake this
for the whole income of a peasant cultivating his own land, gives the
measure of his competency for the subject, and of the degree of
attention he has paid to it.

We will now attempt to discover, from the reviewer’s data and those of
his authors, what may really be the condition of these 2,600,000
proprietors. As the French Government estimates the land-tax at one
tenth of the revenue of the land, families rated at £2 or 50 francs pay,
it is to be presumed, five francs. The average of the contribution
foncière for all France is 2½ francs per hectare, and in the southern
half of the kingdom, which is the most divided, two francs. A hectare
being about 2½ English acres, this gives from five to between six and
seven acres as the portion of land which falls to the lot of each of the
reviewer’s forty-shilling or sixty-shilling freeholders. But it may be
said, this is not the average but the maximum of their possessions. We
will therefore take another estimate, grounded on official documents,
from the reviewer’s authorities, MM. Mounier and Rubichon. “It is hardly
credible,” they say, “that there are in France more than four millions
of proprietors so poor, that they pay no more than 5f. 95c. [say 6f.] to
the contribution foncière.”4 In this case the 5f. 95c. are certainly the
average. Six francs of land-tax corresponds to six acres per family on
the average of all France, and to seven and a half on that of the
southern division, which contains the greatest proportion of small
proprietors. A still more favourable result is given by the calculations
of M. Lullin de Chateauvieux, a much better authority than these
authors, who estimates the average holdings of the 3,900,000 poorest
proprietors at eight acres and a half.5 Now, take any one of these
computations in a fertile country like France, suppose as bad an
agriculture as exists anywhere in Western Europe, and then judge whether
a Edition: current; Page: [1042] single family, industrious and
economical as the French of the poorer classes are, and enjoying the
entire produce of from five to eight and a half acres, subject to a
payment of only tenpence an acre to the Government, can be otherwise
than in a very desirable condition? We do not forget that the land is
sometimes mortgaged for part of the purchase money, and the reviewer
makes a great cry about the tremendous incumbrances by which the land of
France is weighed down; not amounting, however, on his own showing, to
forty per cent. on the rental, which we should think is as favourable a
return as could be made by any landed aristocracy in Europe. The
interest on the mortgages of all France is estimated at twenty-four
millions sterling6 for one hundred and fourteen millions of acres—less
than five shillings per acre: the owner of from five to eight acres
could afford to pay double this amount, and be very well off.

We are aware that this is an average, and that four millions of
properties averaging, according to M. de Chateauvieux, eight acres and
a-half, imply a great number of proprietors who have less. But there
must be a proportional (though not an equal) number who have more; and
it must not be supposed that this statement includes the large
properties, one of which would be enough to keep up the average against
a hundred extremely small ones. No properties are included which pay so
much as twenty francs land-tax, corresponding on the average of France
to twenty acres, of the south to twenty-five. When it is considered that
of the whole soil of France much less than half is in the hands of
peasant proprietors, and that this half is not more subdivided than we
now see, it will probably be thought that hitherto at least the
mischiefs of subdivision have not reached a very formidable height.

But it is not what France now is, so much as what she is becoming that
is the material point. Is the morcellement increasing, or likely to
increase? The apologists of the French system have never denied that the
land in many parts of France is too minutely divided. What they deny is,
that it is a growing evil. They assert that the subdivision has reached
its height, and that the reunions, by purchase, marriage, and
inheritance, now balance the subdivisions. How stands the fact in this
respect? Are the small properties tending to become still smaller or
not? The reader will be surprised when he finds that, with all their
straining, M. Rubichon and his reviewer have failed of proving that the
morcellement, in this sense of the term, is making any progress at all.

The reviewer has a curious theory on the subject. He thinks that “on the
calculated average of three children to each inheritance,” the piece of
land now held by one proprietor must necessarily be divided among three
in the next generation, and among nine in that which follows.7 Under
what system of landed property could a population increase at this rate,
and not be reduced to Edition: current; Page: [1043] starvation? But is
it a fact that population is anywhere trebled in the space of a
generation? We have here blunder within blunder of a very complicated
description. In the first place, he should not have said three children
to one inheritance, but to two inheritances; for as the French law in
questions of property observes that impartial justice between the two
sexes in which other laws are so often deficient, the mother’s patrimony
is on an average equal to that of the father. In the next place, could
not the reviewer have taken the trouble to ascertain at what rate the
French population is actually increasing? If he had, he would have found
that in the 27 years from 1815 to 1842 it only increased 18 per cent.,
and during that period with progressively increasing slowness, namely—in
the first eleven years 9 per cent., in the next nine years less than 6
per cent., and in the seven years from 1835 to 1842, 3 1/10th per cent.
only. cThis retardation we must take the liberty of attributing mainly
to the prudence and forethought generated in the poorest class by this
very subdivision of property.

Instead, therefore, of trebling in a generation, the population
increases in that period about 20 per cent.;d and if the growth of
towns, and of employments not agricultural, in the same space of time is
sufficient to absorb this increase, there needs not be, and will not be,
even if the law does its worst, any increase of subdivision. Now, the
towns of France have increased, and are increasing, at a rate far
exceeding the general increase of the population. We read only the other
day in the Siècle, as the result of the census just concluded, that
Paris, which in 1832 had only 930,000 inhabitants, has now more than
1,350,000, an increase of nearly fifty per cent. in fourteen years.8
There is every reason then to infer, from these general data, that the
morcellement is making no progress.

What facts have M. Rubichon and the Quarterly reviewer to oppose to
these? One fact; which at first sight appears a very strong one. Between
1826 and 1835, the number of properties rated to the land-tax exhibited
an increase of nearly e60,000e.9 Let us first remark, that f60,000f
separate assessments are equivalent only to about g30,000g proprietors,
it being the common estimate of French writers, that on the average
about two cotes foncières or separate accounts with the land-tax
correspond only to a single proprietor. But if the Edition: current;
Page: [1044] reviewer had hturned a few pages backh10 he would have
found a cause iamplyi sufficient to account for a jmuch largerj
increase. There were sold between 1826 and 1835 domains of the State to
the value of nearly 134 millions of francs, or five and a half millions
sterling. The very nature of such a sale implies division. kIf this
immense alienation of public lands created no more than the whole of the
60,000 new accounts which were added to the tax-gatherer’s list during
the period, we must suppose that they were sold in portions exceeding in
average value 2,200 francs, which the state of France renders extremely
improbable. There is every probability, therefore, that during those ten
years the morcellement on the remaining lands of France diminished,
instead of increasing.

A confirmation of this opinion is, that in the ten years preceding those
in question the cotes foncières increased in number only 21,000k;11 an
alarming proof, according to the reviewer, of the progressive advance of
the evil; but, as we suspect, arising from the fact, that during the
earlier decennial period a smaller, though still a considerable amount
of public domains were alienated.

lWe grant that portions of these lands must have been bought by persons
who were already proprietors of other lands in the same commune, in
which case no additional cotes foncières would be created, and to that
extent the force of our argument is weakened. But against this we have
to set the fact, that inl addition to the State lands, a great extent of
mcommunalm lands were likewise alienated during the same period: and it
is further necessary to subtract all the additions made to the number of
cotes foncières by the extension of building, and the natural
subdivision of town property, during ten years. nOn the very data,
therefore, afforded by our adversaries, we should infer that the
subdivision at present, if not receding, is at the worst stationary.

But itn so happens that facts exist more specific and more expressly to
the Edition: current; Page: [1045] point than any of M. Rubichon’s. A
new cadastre, or survey and valuation of lands, has been in progress for
some years past. In thirty-seven cantons, taken indiscriminately through
France, the operation has been completed; in twenty-one it is nearly
complete. In the thirty-seven the cotes foncières, which were 154,266 at
the last cadastre (in 1809 and 1810), have only increased by 9,011,
being less than 18 per cent. in considerably more than thirty years,
while in many of the cantons they have considerably diminished. From
this increase is to be subtracted all which is due to the progress of
building during the period, as well as to the sale of public and
communal lands. In the other twenty-one cantons the number of cotes
foncières is not yet published, but the number of parcelles, or separate
bits of land, has diminished in the same period; and among these
districts is included the greater part of the banlieue of Paris, one of
the most minutely divided districts in France, in which the morcellement
has actually diminished by no less than 16 per cent. The details may be
found in M. Passy’s little work, Des Systèmes de Culture.12 So much for
the terrible progress of subdivision.

oLong as this article is, we cannot close ito without noticing one of
the most signal instances which the reviewer has exhibited of his
incompetency for the subject he treats of. He laments over the
extraordinary number of sales of landed property which he says the law
of inheritance constantly occasions;13 and indeed the sales of land are
shown to have amounted in ten years to no less than one-fourth part of
the whole territorial property of France. Now, whatever else this
extraordinary amount of sale and purchase may prove, the whole of it is
one gigantic argument against the reviewer’s case; for every sale of
land which is caused by the law of inheritance must be a sale for the
express purpose of preventing subdivision. If land, sold in consequence
of an inheritance, is nevertheless subdivided, this cannot be an effect
of the law of inheritance; it would only prove that land sells for a
higher price when sold in small portions: that is, in other words, that
the poor, and even, as the reviewer would have us believe, the very
poor, are able to outbid the rich in the land market. This certainly
does not prove that the very ppoorp of France are so very poor as these
writers try to make out, while it does prove that if so they must be by
far the most industrious and economical people on the face of the earth,
for whichq, also,q some credit ought surely to be given to the system of
peasant properties.a

Edition: current; Page: [1046]
We need not trouble our readers any further with the Quarterly reviewer;
but the state of French agriculture, and the social condition of France,
as connected with it, are subjects on which we have much more to say;
and we shall take an early opportunity of attempting to show what is
really amiss in these matters, and to what causes it is imputable.


357.: THE QUARTERLY REVIEW ON FRENCH AGRICULTURE [3]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 13 JAN., 1847, P. 4

For an account of the origin, text, and variants in this third in a
series of four leaders, see No. 355. This unheaded second leader is
described in Mill’s bibliography as “A third leading article in reply to
the Quarterly Review, on French agriculture, in the Morning Chronicle of
13th January 1847”

(MacMinn, p. 67).

abwe showed on mondayb that the four millions of landowners in France
who can be reckoned among peasant-proprietors, those whose holdings fall
short of twenty acres, are computed by one of the best living
authorities to possess on the average eight and a half English acres
each,1 and that from no authentic documents can the average be brought
much below that amount; a fact wholly incompatible with their being in
the state approaching to starvation in which M. Rubichon and his
reviewer would represent them. It is equally certain that if there is
bad agriculture on these small estates, it is from some other cause than
their smallness. Farms of this size are consistent with agriculture
equal to any on the face of the earth. cWhoever doubts this, let him
refer to any account of the agriculture of West Flanders, originally as
barren a soil as is to be found in Europe, and in which a large
proportion of the farms do not exceed from five to ten acres. If Irish
testimony be wanted, listen to that high practical authority, Mr.
Blacker:

I am firmly persuaded, that the small farmer who holds his own plough,
or digs his own ground, if he follows a proper rotation of crops, and
feeds his cattle in the house, can undersell the large farmer, or in
other words can pay a rent which the other cannot afford; and in this I
am confirmed by the opinion of many practical men who have well
considered the subject.2

The farms of which Mr. Blacker is expressly speaking are those which
vary from five to eight acres.c

We shall now, however, touch upon another kind of morcellement, which
Edition: current; Page: [1047] does amount to a serious inconvenience,
and wherever it exists must have a strong tendency to keep agriculture
in a low state. This is the subdivision, not of the land of the country
among many proprietors, but of the land of each proprietor into many
detached pieces, or parcelles, as they are technically designated. This
inconvenience has been experienced in other countries besides France, as
in the canton of Zurich, in the Palatinate, and (as respects holdings,
though not properties) in Ireland. In France it is carried to so great
an excess, that the number of parcelles is ten times the number of cotes
foncières; and as there are supposed to be twice as many cotes foncières
as proprietors, the curious fact is disclosed, that on the average of
France the estate of every landowner consists of twenty fragments in
twenty different places. The consequences are a subject of general and
increasing complaint. Great loss of time and labour; waste of cultivable
soil in boundaries and paths; the inaccessibility of many parcelles,
without trespassing on other properties; endless disputes and frequent
litigation, are enumerated among the evils; and it is evident what
obstacles the small size and dispersed position of the parcelles, and
their intermixture with those of other proprietors, must oppose to many
kinds of agricultural improvement.

For a considerable portion of this evil the French law of inheritance
may fairly be held responsible. A certain amount of it is inevitable
wherever landed properties are undergoing a double process of division
and recomposition: marriages, for example, must in general bring
together portions of land not adjacent. But if parents had the power of
bequest, the owner of twenty parcelles, even if he adhered to the spirit
of the law of equal division, would give some of the portions entire to
one child, and others to another. The law, on the contrary, must divide
with exact equality; and as it is generally impossible to adjust the
value of patches of unequal fertility, vineyards, meadows, arable, &c.,
so as to satisfy everybody, it continually happens, especially in the
more backward parts of France, that when the settlement is made by
division instead of sale, each co-heir insists on taking a share of
every parcelle, instead of the whole of some parcelles; from whence, no
doubt, the amazing multiplication of these little patches in many parts
of France.

This evil, while it would not exist to any very material extent except
under the peculiar French law of inheritance, is not inevitable even
under that law. The enormous extent of sales of land, amounting in ten
years to a fourth part of the landed property of France, are a clear
proof that in general the adjustment of inheritances is not effected by
a subdivision of the land, but by sale: which it needs scarcely be
remarked, does not necessarily imply parting with the land, there being
nothing to hinder the heirs themselves from becoming the purchasers. We
have no doubt it would be found that this rational mode of executing the
law is tending more and more to become universal. To hasten the undoing
of the mischief which has been already done, the Government has been
often urged (in some instances by Councils-General of Departments) to
propose a law authorising the consolidation of landed properties by a
general valuation and Edition: current; Page: [1048] exchange of
allotments in every commune in which the majority of the proprietors may
apply for it; and unless the evil is seen to be correcting itself by a
spontaneous process, nothing, we should think, can long prevent the
adoption of so salutary an expedient.

That French agriculture, and the condition of the peasant population,
are injuriously affected by this sort of morcellement is so far true,
that it must considerably retard the improvement which might otherwise
be expected, and which, in spite of all hindrances, does even now, to a
great extent, take place. More than this we cannot admit. There are
conclusive proofs of great and rapid improvement in some parts of
France, and M. Rubichon and his reviewer have no evidence whatever of
retrogression in any.

They produce tables of the average amount of different kinds of food
consumed by the population; also tables of the number of cattle, the
amount of produce per hectare of the different kinds of cultivation,
&c., calculated from the official documents. These estimates, assuming
their correctness (which, so far as that quality is attainable, we
generally see no reason to discredit), are indicative, doubtless, of a
low and backward state. But statistics are only evidence of the present.
Where are the statistics of the past? That the agriculture of a great
part of France is rude and imperfect is known to all Europe; but that it
ever was better is an assertion opposed to all evidence, and we shall
not take M. Rubichon’s word for it, no more than for the notion that the
food and general condition of the mass of the people has been
deteriorating from the time of Louis XIV, d if not earlier. At this last
proposition we cannot repress our wonder. In the reign of Louis XIV,
Marshal Vauban, a great authority with all who are themselves
authorities, and even with M. Rubichon, estimated that one-tenth of the
population of France were beggars, and five of the remaining nine-tenths
little above beggary.3 In the same reign, Labruyère claimed credit for
apprising the salons of Paris that a Edition: current; Page: [1049]
strange nondescript sort of animals, who might be seen in the fields,
and were much addicted to grubbing in the earth, were, though nobody
would suppose it, a kind of men.4 Some readers may remember the picture
drawn by the old Marquis Mirabeau of the rural population in the middle
of the eighteenth century;5 nor was Arthur Young’s, at the opening of
the Revolution, much more favourable.6 eWhile now,

the classes of the population who have only their wages, and who for
that reason are the most exposed to indigence, are much better provided
with the requisites of food, lodging, and clothing than they were at the
beginning of the century. The fact may be established by the testimony
of all who have a personal recollection of the earlier of the two
epochs. If there could be a doubt on the subject, it might be dissipated
by consulting aged cultivators and workpeople, as I have myself done in
various localities, without meeting with a single opposing testimony: we
may also refer to the facts collected on the subject by an exact
observer, M. Villermé. (From a recent work by an intelligent writer,
Recherches sur les Causes de l’Indigence, par A. Clément.)7e

M. Rubichon’s statistics comprise no returns of the rate of wages. We
are quite willing that our case should rest upon the result of an
inquiry into that one point.

As for agriculture, when it is recollected that, at the beginning of
this century, in the greater part of France the culture of artificial
grasses might be said to be unknown, and that the course of cultivation
consisted solely of grain crops and fallows, it will be difficult to
make us believe that, even in the most backward parts of the country,
there has not been a considerable improvement from so miserable a level.

The blind zeal with which M. Rubichon presses everything into the
service of his theory, in which he is faithfully echoed by his reviewer,
makes them lay great stress upon the increase of roots, and other
inferior kinds of culture, as a proof that the population is sinking to
an inferior kind of nutriment;8 as if the same Edition: current; Page:
[1050] thing was not happening in England; as if it was not a necessary
condition of an improved rotation of crops that other cultures should
increase in a greater proportion than grain culture, and even at the
expense, in some degree, of the inferior kinds of grain.

We have admitted, and again admit the unsatisfactory state of
cultivation on a very great portion of the soil of France; but would it
be any better if the estates were large? Is it any better now on the
large estates? When M. Rubichon and his reviewer talk of the small
properties as “creating a new Ireland in France,”9 his own pages make it
known that the large properties, in the backward parts of France, are
already an Ireland, in the very worst feature of Irish landed
mismanagement, the system of middlemen. It is a general practice,
according to M. de Chateauvieux, with the great proprietors of the
central departments, to let their land en bloc to a middleman, usually
an attorney or a notary, who sublets it in small portions on the métayer
system, and is not only, as in Ireland, the hardest and most grasping of
landlords, but having only a temporary tenure, and being no
agriculturist, of course expends nothing in improvements.10 Of
fifty-seven millions of acres cultivated by tenants, twenty-one millions
only are held by farmers at fixed rents, and thirty-six millions on the
métayer tenure; which in France implies all the defects with very few of
the advantages of proprietary cultivation; the only exceptions being La
Vendée and a few of the adjoining departments, where the large
proprietors are residentf; a sort of patriarchalf relationship subsists
between them and their tenants, and the métayers have in general, as in
Tuscany, a virtual fixity of tenure. We do not believe it will be found
in any part of France that the small properties are under a bad
agriculture, and the large properties under a good one. They are both
bad or both good. Where large farms exist and are well cultivated, the
small properties also are well managed and prosperous.

And this brings us to the principal cause, both now and formerly, of the
unimproved agriculture and scanty application of capital to the soil of
France. This is, the exclusive taste of the wealthy and middle classes
for town life and town pursuits, combined with the general want of
enterprise of the French nation with respect to industrial improvements.
It is truly, though epigrammatically, said somewhere in these volumes,
by M. Rubichon, that the Frenchman, generally, knows but one way of
getting rich; namely, thrift.11 He does not understand sowing money
freely to reap it largely. This is the true cause why, when large
properties are sold, they bring the greatest price by being much
subdivided. The peasants, thanks to the Revolution, to the small
properties, and Edition: current; Page: [1051] to their own unparalleled
prudence, are able to purchase land, and their savings are the only part
of the wealth of the country which takes that direction. We are often
told, that it does not answerg capitalists to buy land at the
extravagant price which the passion of the peasantry for land induces
them to give, amounting often to forty years’ purchase. It does not
answer to pay that price, in order to live idly on the rent in Paris, or
the large provincial towns. But if there was one particle of the spirit
of agricultural improvement in the owners of the monied wealth which is
so largely increasing in the manufacturing and commercial districts, few
speculations would be more profitable than to buy land in many fertile
and ill-cultivated parts of France, at even more than forty years’
purchase of its wretchedly low rental, which would soon be doubled or
trebled by the application of capital, with ordinary agricultural
knowledge and enterprise. If the petite culture is half as wasteful and
unprofitable as is pretended, the profit would be proportional of
substituting la grande culture for it. The thing would be soon done if
the love of industrial progress should ever supplant in the French mind
the love of national glory, or if the desire of national glorification
should take that direction. But with a people who dislike rural
pursuits, and in the pursuit of money-getting prefer the beaten ways,
there can be no other farming than peasant farming.a

In one article more we hope to dispose of the remainder of the subject.


358.: THE QUARTERLY REVIEW ON FRENCH AGRICULTURE [4]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 16 JAN., 1847, P. 4

For an account of the origin, text, and variants in this last of a
series, see No. 355. This unheaded third leader is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “A fourth leading article in reply to the Quarterly
Review on French agriculture, in the Morning Chronicle of 16th Jany
1847”

(MacMinn, p. 67).

athe cheval de bataille of M. Rubichon and his English followers against
the petite propriété is the cattle question; not without cause, since on
this subject they have an indisputable basis of fact, however inadequate
to sustain the superstructure they have raised upon it.1 The supply of
butcher’s meat to some of the principal towns, especially Paris, is less
copious than formerly. It has increased greatly, but in a less ratio
than the population. Of the fact there is no doubt, since on this point
there are trustworthy statistics of the past as well as of the present.
In 1789 the consumption of meat in Paris averaged 68 kilogrammes
Edition: current; Page: [1052] (150 lbs.) for each person; in 1841 it
was but 55 (121 lbs.),2 and there are also complaints of a falling off
in the quality.3

The Quarterly reviewer treats very cavalierly the explanation given of
this fact by M. Cunin-Gridaine, Minister of Commerce and Agriculture.
“This is to be accounted for by the revolution which has taken place in
the working classes; Paris having become the most manufacturing town in
Europe.”4 Industrielle is not exactly synonymous with manufacturing, but
let that pass. On this the reviewer:

This seems a strange explanation. The new population of Paris is to
starve on an bounce of meat [quaere five ounces]b per diem. How is that?
Pooh! says the Liberal Minister, they are only manufacturers. This
solution will not be very agreeable to those theorists amongst us who
confound the extension of manufactures with the welfare and comfort of
the working people. The more candid Minister of Louis Philippe assumes
that a manufacturing population must of necessity be worse fed than
other classes.5

The reviewer is evidently no Oedipus. But he might have found in another
page of M. Rubichon’s treatise what the Minister meant.6 In a town such
as Paris before the Revolution, in which there was, comparatively
speaking, no production at all, but only distribution—the population
consisting of the great landlords, the Court and higher functionaries
paid by the State, the bankers, financiers, government contractors, and
other monied classes, with the great and small dealers and tradesmen
needful for supplying these opulent consumers, and few labourers beyond
those who cannot be wanting in so large a town—all will see that the
richer must bear an unusually high numerical proportion to the poorer
consumers in such a city. Suppose now that a Manchester or a Glasgow
grows up in the place. It is pretty evident that while this would add a
little to the richer class, it would add twenty times as much to the
poorer. Considering now that the upper and middle classes in France are
great consumers of animal food, while the poor consume very little, the
ration of each poor person might in these circumstances increase very
much, while yet the average consumption per head of the whole city,
owing to the diminished proportional numbers of the richer class, might
be considerably diminished. We have little doubt that this is the fact,
and that the great increase in the inferior kinds of animal food
introduced into Paris would prove to be for the use, not of those who
formerly used the superior kinds, but in a great measure for those who
seldom obtained animal food at all.

Edition: current; Page: [1053]
This, however, does not explain the whole of the change which has taken
place, for the price of butcher’s meat has also risen in the Paris
markets so materially as to be a source of great privation and
complaint. The rise may be ascribed to various causes. In the first
place, “France has till lately always been a large importer of cattle;
and down to 1814 they were exempted from all duty. In that year,
however, a duty of three francs was laid on each head of cattle
imported;” and in 1822 the duty “was suddenly raised to 55 francs, an
increase which has well nigh put a stop to the importation” (M’Culloch’s
Geographical Dictionary, art. France).7 Secondly, the octroi, or town
custom duty, now so burthensome, did not exist at all in 1789, and has
been largely increased at various periods both in Paris and most other
towns since its first establishment. These causes are enough of
themselves to account for a considerable part of the enhancement
complained of.

But if there were not these causes, there is cause almost sufficient in
the very fact of an increased and rapidly increasing population. Paris
has added, in 14 years, between four and five hundred thousand to its
inhabitants—an increase of nearly one-half. The agriculture of a country
must be rapidly improving indeed, if an increase like this can take
place in a single market without compelling it to draw its supplies from
a larger surface and a greater distance, and therefore at an increased
expense. Where would London have been by this time, for the supply of
its markets, but for our great coasting trade, and the invention of
steam navigation, which conveys not only cattle but carcasses from the
extremity of Scotland, as cheaply as they can be brought from
Buckinghamshire? The cattle for the supply of Paris must travel by land,
from distances varying from 50 to 150 leagues (this rests on the
authority of a committee of the Municipal Council of Paris, in 1841),8
and after so long a journey have either to be brought to market out of
condition, or to be fattened in the immediate neighbourhood. Can any
one, then, be surprised that a doubled population cannot be so well or
so cheaply supplied as one of half the number?

To these three causes of the diminished supply of butcher’s meat in the
towns, we are not afraid to add a fourth, which, though resting mainly
on general considerations, we should not be wholly unable to support by
positive evidence. This is, the increased consumption by the country
people. They have less animal food in proportion, to spare for the
towns, because they retain more of it for their own use.

On what evidence is it asserted that small properties imply deficiency
of cattle, and consequent deficiency of manure? That they are not
favourable to sheep farming seems to be admitted; but the breeding and
fattening of horned cattle is Edition: current; Page: [1054] so
perfectly compatible with small capital, that in the opinion of many
continental authorities, small farms have the advantage in this respect,
and so great an advantage as to be more than a compensation for their
inferiority in sheep.c dWest Flanders exports a great quantity of dairy
produce. In one of the most minutely divided parts of Switzerland, the
canton of Zurich, the extent of arable is said to have diminished
because the cultivators have found “that with more limited tillage and
more numerous cattle breeding they can raise as much grain on a smaller
space, and gain the profits of their cattle besides” (Statistical
Account of Zurich, by G. M. von Knonau, published in 1834).9 In Thurgau,
a most minutely divided canton, since the sub-division of the large
holdings “a third or a fourth part produces as much grain and as many
head of cattle as the entire holding did before” (Statistical Account of
the Canton of Thurgau, by U.P. Strohmeier, 1836).10 In Soleure, a
similar authority states that the commonest day labourers usually eat
flesh meat twice a day.11 Schaffhausen has changed, between 1829 and
1840, from one of the most backward districts of the confederacy, in the
article of cattle, to one of the most advanced.12 In French Flanders and
in Belgium, according to M. Passy, the districts where the farms are
smallest contain the greatest abundance of live stock.13 The following
remarkable facts are from a statistical work on the commune of Vensat,
in Auvergne, one of the least improved provinces of France, lately
published by M. Jusseraud, mayor of the place. We have not seen the work
itself, but our citation is from M. Passy’s essay, Des Systèmes de
Culture:

In the commune of Vensat, which comprises 1,612 hectares, divided into
4,600 parcelles, belonging to 591 proprietors, the land in cultivation
is composed of 1,466 hectares. In 1790, seventeen farms occupied
two-thirds of this extent, and twenty others the remainder. Since that
time the land has been divided, and at present the smallness of the
parcelles is extreme. What has been the effect upon live stock? A
considerable augmentation. In 1790 the commune contained only about 300
horned cattle, and from 1,800 to 2,000 sheep; it now reckons 676 of the
former and 533 of the latter. Thus, to replace 1,300 sheep it has
acquired 376 oxen and cows; and (one ox or cow being considered
equivalent to ten sheep by French agriculturists) all things computed,
the Edition: current; Page: [1055] quantity of manure has increased in
the ratio of 490 to 729, or more than forty per cent. In addition to
which, the animals, being stronger and better fed, contribute much more
largely to keep up the fertility of the soil.14

The conclusions which follow from these facts, follow also from the
reason of the case.d It is argued that the petite propriété must
diminish cattle because it leads to the breaking up of natural pasture.
But when natural pasture is fit for the plough, a greater number of
cattle than were supported on the whole may be supported on a part, by
laying it out in roots and artificial grasses; and it is well known that
on the stall-feeding system there is much greater preservation of
manure. The question of petite culture, in relation to cattle, is, in
fact, one and the same with the question of stall-feeding. The two
things must stand or fall together. Stall-feeding produces, caeteris
paribus, a greater quantity of provisions, but in the opinion of most
judges a lower quality. Experience must decide.

This brings us back to the causes assigned, by the committee of the
Paris town-council, for the falling off in the quality of the beef
consumed at Paris. One is, the extraordinary increase in the consumption
of dairy produce.15 Milk is now brought from distances of thirty
leagues, and within six or eight leagues of Paris no calves are now bred
up, all being sold at the earliest moment possible. In consequence, a
great part of the beef sold at Paris is the flesh of cows too old to be
fit for producing milk. A second cause assigned is, eas
before-mentioned,e the increase of stall-feeding. But the committee
makes an instructive distinction. In Normandy, which affords the
greatest portion of the supply, the quality, they say, has deteriorated;
but in La Vendée, and the central provinces, the Limousin, Nivernais,
Bourbonnais, and La Marche, “there is improvement in weight, in fatness,
and from some districts in number,”16 although these countries have also
adopted stall-feeding; and in this, say the committee, there is no
contradiction, since “what is a deterioration in the rich pasturages of
Calvados, is improvement in the petites herbes of the Allier and the
Nièvre.”17

It may now be left to the reader to judge if the case of our adversaries
has not broken down as completely on this, their strongest point, as it
has done on every other point of any importance.

We cannot close this long controversy without producing evidence of the
extraordinary improvement, extraordinary both in amount and in rapidity,
which is taking place in the productiveness of the agriculture of some
parts of France. Edition: current; Page: [1056] We quote from another
work by an authority already cited, M. Hippolite Passy, several times a
minister of Louis Philippe, and well-known as one of the first
politicians and publicists of France. This tract, published in 1841, is
an examination of “the changes in the agricultural condition of the
department of the Eure since 1800.”18 The Eure is one of the five
departments of Normandy, and belongs to the region of which M. Rubichon
admits the agriculture to be the best in France;19 but only (as he
contends) because the morcellement has not had time to produce its
effects, having commenced in that region only from the Revolution, and
he assigns to it accordingly no privilege but that of Outis in the
Odyssey, to be devoured the last.20 Let us now see the facts. This
department fortunately possesses an accurate agricultural statistique
for the year 1800, drawn up by a préfet who took great pains to be
correct in his information. M. Passy’s pamphlet is a comparison of these
returns with those collected by the present French Government in 1837.

In this interval of thirty-seven years scarcely any new land has been
taken into cultivation, nearly all fit for culture being already
occupied. But fallows have diminished from 172,000 hectares to a little
more than 80,000. The cultures which supply cattle have increased in a
much greater proportion than any others: instead of 17 per cent. of the
cultivated area, they now occupy 37 per cent. Horses have multiplied
from 29,500 to 51,000, horned cattle from 51,000 to 106,000, sheep from
205,000 to 511,000, and as their food has increased in a still greater
ratio, and there is importation besides, all kinds of live stock are
better fed, and have gained in size, weight, and value. The produce per
hectare of all kinds of grain, and of most other kinds of produce, has
considerably increased, of some kinds nearly doubled. These changes have
chiefly been effected during the second half of the period, so that the
improvement is as progressive as on M. Rubichon’s theory should have
been the deterioration. There has been no perceptible variation in the
proportion between the grande and the petite culture; nor has the
division of properties at all promoted the division of farms. On the
soils where small farms are most profitable, large properties are rented
to small tenants; where the reverse is the case, a single farmer often
rents the lands of several proprietors, and this arrangement extends
itself more and more as the subdivision of property advances. The
consumption of food per head of the population has largely increased, in
the ratio, according to M. Passy, of about 37 per cent.; and while the
agricultural wealth of the department has increased, according to his
estimate, by 54 per cent., the population has only increased 5 per
cent.f

Edition: current; Page: [1057]
Though the Eure belongs to the most productive and thriving region of
France, it is not the most productive or the most thriving department.
The Nord, which comprises the greater part of French Flanders, and is a
country of small farms, maintains, according to M. Passy, proportionally
to its extent, a third more cattle than the Eure, and the average
produce of wheat per hectare, instead of seventeen, is twenty
hectolitres, about twenty-two English bushels per acre.21

Results almost as satisfactory may be deduced from a statistical account
of a much less improved district than the Eure, the most eastern
district of Brittany, the arrondissement of Fougères, published in 1846,
by the Sous-préfet, M. Bertin. “It is only since the peace,” says this
intelligent functionary, “that the agriculture of the arrondissement has
made much progress; but from 1815 it has improved with increasing
rapidity. If from 1815 to 1825 the improvement was as one, it was as
three between 1825 and 1835, and as six since that period.”22 At the
beginning of the century little wheat was cultivated, and that little so
ill that in 1809 the produce per hectare was estimated only at 9
hectolitres. At present M. Bertin estimates it at 16. The cattle being
better fed, and crossed with more vigorous breeds, have increased in
size and strength; while in number, horned cattle, between 1813 and
1844, multiplied from 33,000 to 52,000, sheep from 6,300 to 11,000,
swine from 9,300 to 26,100, and horses from 7,400 to 11,600. New and
valuable manures have been introduced, and have come largely into use.
The extent of meadow land has increased and is increasing, and great
attention has of late been paid to its improvement.23 This testimony
comes from an enemy of the morcellement, who, however, states that it is
advancing very slowly, and is not likely to advance much further, the
co-heirs not dividing each parcelle, but either distributing the
parcelles among them, or disposing of them by private or public sale.
Some farmers, he galso says, who areg proprietors, have the good sense
to sell the few fields which belong to them, in order to increase their
farming capital. M. Bertin is an enemy to stall-feeding, which, he says,
is not practised in his arrondissement.24 The increase of live stock is
all the more remarkable. It may not be useless to mention an assertion
of this writer, that the official publication from which M. Rubichon’s
data are taken greatly understates the number of horned cattle in
France, by the accidental omission of a column in summing up, by which
the number is brought below ten millions, when it ought, according to M.
Bertin, to be thirteen.25

Edition: current; Page: [1058]
Of the food of the inhabitants, he says, that not long ago it was
composed almost exclusively of milk, buckwheat cakes, and rye bread, but
has greatly improved in quantity, quality, and variety, especially in
the last ten years, and now consists of wheaten bread, or bread of
two-thirds wheat and one-third rye, with butter, vegetables, and “in
good farms” about a kilogramme, or h2½h lbs., of pork per week for each
person. There is also some consumption of other flesh-meats among the
labouring people, and the arrondissement contains 63 butchers’ shops,
where fifteen years ago there were not 30; the increase not being in the
itowns,i but in the villages.26 The clothing of the rural population is
substantial, “and different for every season, which is always a sign of
general comfort,” and “persons in rags are very rare in the
arrondissement.”27

We cannot further extend this long jarticlej, but enough has been saidk;
and our readers will now be ablek adequately to appreciate the terrible
predictions of alarmist writers lon the consequences of the division of
propertyl.a


359.: THE IRISH DEBATES IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 5 FEB., 1847, PP. 4-5

This article discusses the long-awaited plans of the Government to deal
with the Irish crisis, announced by Russell on 25 Jan. in his speech on
the state of Ireland (PD, 3rd ser., Vol. 89, cols. 426-52) and debated
on 1 and 2 Feb. (cols. 619-90 and 694-765). Among many suggested
measures, Russell proposed that £1 million be set aside to purchase
waste lands from the landlords (if necessary by expropriation), drain
them, create roads, and erect necessary buildings. The land was to be
divided into lots, perhaps of twenty-five to fifty acres, and sold or
let to small proprietors (cols. 442-3). However, on that day the only
Bill introduced by Russell was the “Bill to Make Further Provision for
the Relief of the Destitute Poor in Ireland,” 10 Victoria (25 Jan.,
1847), PP, 1847, III, 187-212, establishing outdoor relief. Mill’s
unheaded first leader (which follows immediately after the report of the
previous day’s session in the Commons) is described in his bibliography
as “A leading article on the Irish debates in the House of Commons, in
the Morning Chronicle of 5th February 1847”

(MacMinn, p. 67).

although the ministerial plan for dealing with the waste lands of
Ireland falls far short of what we contend for, and is anything but such
as might have been expected from the enlightened general view of the
subject taken in Lord John Russell’s speech, yet when we contrast the
principles which he Edition: current; Page: [1059] propounded, and which
he is prepared, though in an inadequate manner, to act upon, with the
profound unacquaintance with the subject hitherto manifested by those
speakers in Parliament who have constituted themselves his critics—Sir
Robert Peel being one1—it is impossible to refuse to Lord John Russell
and his colleagues a considerable share of comparative praise.
Certainly, if we had indulged the hope that any other political leaders
or notabilities would be found better furnished with ideas applicable to
the reform of that disgrace to England and to civilization, the social
condition of Ireland, the debate of Monday and Tuesday would have
wofully undeceived us. The Ministerial measures, timid and mesquin as
they appear to us in some points, rash and headlong in others, are
absolutely resplendent by the side of the objections which have been
made to them. On no point is this more the case than on the question of
the waste lands.

If the objectors to this feature of the Ministerial measures had made
themselves so far acquainted with the subject as to know what point they
were really asked to discuss; if from one single word of any of their
speeches a bystander could have suspected that the question at issue was
that of peasant proprietors; if they had betrayed the smallest
consciousness that there was such a subject, or that the idea had ever
entered into anybody’s head that the cultivator of the soil could be the
owner of it; one would have listened respectfully for what they had to
say on the point—what facts or what arguments they were about to
produce, that could assist rational persons in making up their minds on
that momentous social question, either generally or in relation to
Ireland. We certainly did expect that something of this kind would have
been attempted. It might be good reasoning or bad reasoning, but we did
think there would have been some reasoning that would have touched the
point. It appears we were wrong in expecting any thought at all; we
ought to have laid our account with seeing the question disposed of by a
summary appeal to a common-place. “Land is too much subdivided in
Ireland; would you subdivide it more?” “The poverty of Ireland arises
from the mischievous custom of having land held in small patches by
labourers; and this is a plan for making a still greater number of these
small landholders.”2 This is positively the substance of all that these
gentlemen have to say. So that all modes of holding land are in their
opinion alike. The difference between holding it as cottiers and as
proprietors—between the very worst tenure, morally, socially, and
industrially, on the surface of the earth (slave countries alone
excepted), and the very best—is in their estimation not worth
considering. They claim to know Ireland, to prescribe for Ireland,
leaving the cottier system out of the case.

Edition: current; Page: [1060]
Let us briefly go over some of the points of practical difference
between a cottier and a peasant proprietor. A cottier, in a county
overpeopled in proportion to the efficiency of its labour, has nothing
that he can call his own. He has agreed to pay for the land, not simply
its very utmost value, but a rent generally higher than it is possible
he should really pay and continue to live. Except, therefore, the daily
meal of potatoes, everything he raises from the soil belongs to the
landlord. Everything the peasant proprietor can raise is his own. The
proprietor, if he invests any labour in the soil, improves his own
property; the cottier only the landlord’s. If the proprietor works hard,
early and late, the gain is his; if the cottier were fool enough to do
so, the whole benefit would be the landlord’s. If the proprietor has a
larger family than can either be useful on the land, or find employment
elsewhere, the burthen is his; if the cottier does so, it is the
landlord’s. The landlord alone gains by the cottier’s industry, and
alone loses by his indolence or misconduct. That Ireland under this
system does not exhibit a very pleasing picture of prosperity, is no
great argument against a system precisely the opposite. We are quite
willing to have it proved that peasant properties are not the right
thing for Ireland; but whoever thinks that this proves it, has no
business to have an opinion on the question. If he is such a stranger to
the whole subject of the tenure of land, that he knows no difference as
to the condition and habits of a people between cottier tenancy and
proprietorship, we tell him, in all civility, that no one who is
competent to form an opinion on the matter can learn anything from his
opinion on it.

The remaining one of the two solemn common-places which have done
laborious duty as arguments in the speeches of Sir Robert Peel and
others, is this: The improvement of land is not a business for a
Government; it should be left to private enterprise. If the waste lands
were worth reclaiming, individuals would reclaim them. If they are not
worth reclaiming by individuals, they are not worth it at all.3

One cannot wonder at the distrust in which general principles are held,
when one sees this kind of abuse of them. They are dangerous things in
the hands of men who use them à tort et à travers, without considering,
when they run away with a principle, whether the reason of the principle
accompanies them or not. In the first place, we ask Sir Robert Peel, or
any one who agrees with him, if they are prepared to stand by the
proposition, that everything in Ireland which would answer as a
pecuniary speculation, every improvement which would remunerate
capitalists for undertaking it, is, in point of fact, now actually done
and accomplished? We thought it had been a settled matter that capital
will not go into Ireland to undertake even the most promising
speculations; and, indeed, while society there is on the footing it is,
we should almost as soon expect capital to go and employ itself among
the Bedouin Arabs. A country must be peaceful Edition: current; Page:
[1061] and industrious before it can be assumed, that whatever private
capitalists cannot be found to do is not worth doing at all.

But, in the next place, we must suggest that reclamation of land by
capitalists and reclamation by peasants are two things. They are
undertaken from different motives, conducted on distinct principles, and
land not worth anything for the one purpose may be excellently adapted
to the other. When a monied man buys land and improves it, by draining,
inclosing, and the like, the reumuneration he looks to is the saleable
price of the land, which is of course grounded on its capacity of
yielding rent. When a peasant reclaims land, his remuneration is the
whole of the gross produce. Is it a new proposition in political
economy, that land may afford a large gross produce and ample support to
labourers, and yet yield no rent? Is it a new doctrine in commonsense,
that a bog or a mountain may not remunerate a capitalist for reclaiming
it by paying wages to hired labourers, and yet may be a most valuable
possession to a peasant who gets the labour for nothing, having but too
much of it already idle on his hands? Whoever has not drawn this
distinction has not yet adverted to the very first elements of the
subject. Setting principle and reason aside, whoever has studied the
facts of this question, knows that some of the most productive soil in
Europe consists of land originally reclaimed from absolute worthlessness
in this very manner. What are the Polders of West Flanders? Originally
land precisely similar to the Goodwin Sands, or rather a part of those
sands themselves: the pounded débris carried down by the Rhine, the
Meuse, and the Scheld, and deposited on the coast. No landlord or
capitalist could or would have cultivated this land: peasants reclaimed
it, and made it produce some of the finest crops in Europe, and made
themselves one of the most prosperous populations. But those peasants
were proprietors: it was the “magic of property,” as Arthur Young says,
which turned those “sands into gold.”4 As we said before, we are quite
willing to have it proved that these splendid results would not happen
in Ireland. But we do not care for any man’s opinion thereupon, who has
no reason to give but that if the thing was worth doing, rich men would
find their account in doing it for profit. Whoever has nothing but this
to say, had better hold his peace. He shows that he has no grounds for
an opinion on the matter.

If no more were meant than that in reclaiming the waste lands everything
which can be done by the peasants should be left for the peasants to do,
it is only what we have ourselves repeatedly urged. The plan of the
Government, as we understand it, appears to err in this point, among
many others; it aims at doing too much to the land. It should do little
or nothing, in our opinion, but the general drainage; what was aptly
called in the debate the arterial drainage of the country.5 This the
Government has engaged to do for the great landlords, and Edition:
current; Page: [1062] nobody then complained of it as a thing unfit for
a Government, and which individuals should be left to do for themselves.
Individuals could almost as well maintain fleets and armies for
themselves. But what can be done and done well by individuals, should
not be done for them by a Government. If the Ministers understand their
own principles, they will reconsider as much of their waste-land project
as implies that any land shall be completely prepared for cultivation at
the expense of the State.


360.: AUSTIN ON CENTRALIZATION
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 6 FEB., 1847, PP. 4-5

John Austin (1790-1859), husband of Sarah, lawyer and
jurisprudentialist, with whom Mill had studied law in the early 1820s,
had reviewed works by Cormenin, Vivien, Dunoyer, and Laing in
“Centralization,” Edinburgh Review, LXXXV (Jan. 1847), 221-58
(anonymously, but the author’s identity was known to Mill). Austin was
by temperament and habit unable to publish much, a circumstance that
explains Mill’s comment to him in a letter of 13 Apr., 1847: “The notice
in the Chronicle, to which I am indebted for your letter, was, as you
supposed, mine. It is really a pity that all the trouble you must have
taken with the article on Centralisation should have produced nothing
more than a review article.” (EL, CW, Vol. XIII, p. 711; for further
praise of the article, and comment on Austin’s abilities and problems,
see Mill’s letter to Alexander Duff-Gordon of 27 Jan., 1847, ibid., pp.
706-7.) This unheaded third leader (not a review) is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “A leading article on Mr. Austin’s article in the
Edinburgh Review on Centralization, in the Morning Chronicle of 6th
Febry 1847”

(MacMinn, p. 67).

there are two modes of arguing disputed questions, whether speculative
or practical: one of these has the recommendation of being most to the
purpose, the other has that of being the easiest, and very often the
most persuasive. The first is, to discuss the thing on its special
merits: if what you are contending against is a principle, to prove that
it is false; if a project, to show that it is ill adapted to its
purpose, or point out some pernicious consequences which it tends to
produce. The other, and shorter mode of attack, is to find some phrase
which, for reasons good or bad, is understood in an alarming sense, and
which is sufficiently elastic to bear any little stretching that may be
necessary to enable the opinion you are desirous of discrediting to be
brought within it. Many a moral and political truth, many a salutary
proposal, have been hooted down, without the compliment of examination,
because they were said to be theory. Every newspaper presents examples
of some wiseacre who thinks he has completely demolished some maxim of
reason and common sense by calling it political economy. If it is
proposed to take anything from anybody, no matter how little right he
may have to it, or how ample a compensation it is intended to give him,
spoliation is the Edition: current; Page: [1063] word. We have often
thought that a dictionary of catch-words, with a full analysis of the
proper meaning of each in the English language, and an enumeration of
its misapplications, distinguishing the ideas it ought to convey, and
those which it only serves to confound, would be a valuable service,
both to public discussion and to philosophy.

A service of this nature has been rendered by an admirable article in
the last number of the Edinburgh Review, with respect to a word
continually bandied to and fro by loose talkers on government and
administration, when discussing subjects beyond their comprehension—the
word “Centralization.” The article is the production of an eminently
clear and precise thinker; qualities which ought to be much commoner
than they are, for every one is not capable of thinking profoundly, but
all ought to be able to think with exactness, to be fully masters of
their ideas, and of the meaning of the terms they use. But this writer
has still higher merits; a power and a determination to go to the very
bottom of his subject, and be satisfied with no explanation which leaves
any real difficulty unsolved. His style of writing is worthy of such a
thinker; he uses no word by which something is not added to the sense.

Any interference by a government, [says the reviewer,] with the
interests and concerns of its subjects, however expedient that
interference may be, is reproached by those who would raise a prejudice
against it with a tendency to centralization; and by this brandishing of
a word (which, as being imperfectly understood, is full of mysterious
terrors) they can work on the practical convictions of their hearers or
readers with an effect which they could not produce by a perspicuous
statement of their reasons. To obviate the prevalent mistakes concerning
centralization, and to obviate the obstacles to improvement which they
have raised, and are likely to raise, is the purpose of the present
article.

[P. 221.]

And with this view he endeavours to define and fix the idea of
centralization, and to distinguish it from the things with which it is
habitually confounded, more especially from “over-governing, that is, an
over-meddling by governments with the interests and concerns of their
subjects.” [Ibid.]

Centralization, according to the reviewer’s simple and comprehensive
conception, means, such a constitution of the subordinate authorities in
a state, and such a determination of their functions, as tends strongly
to make them practically dependent upon the supreme or sovereign
authority. In theory, they are always thus dependent. It is assumed in
all governments, that every subordinate authority exercises only such
powers as the legislature confers, and exercises them for the end and in
the spirit which the legislature intended and approves. It is never
supposed that they assert any independence of the supreme power in the
state, or exercise any other discretion than what that supreme power
knowingly and purposely entrusted to them. A centralized administration,
then, is an administration so organized as to insure that the conformity
thus assumed in theory, between the intentions of the supreme and the
conduct of the subordinate Edition: current; Page: [1064] authorities,
shall exist in fact. And the reviewer has no difficulty in showing that
centralization, thus understood, is one of the main elements of good
government; that, “if the form of the government be good, centralization
will enhance its good tendencies; if the form of the government be bad,”
the same thing will “go far to correct its bad ones.” [P. 236.]

But we are most desirous to draw attention to the portion of the article
which combats the prevailing misconceptions. A centralized government,
as commonly conceived, is “an over-regulating, over-restraining,
over-protecting government; paternal, as its friends would call it; a
pestilent busy-body, as it would be called by its enemies.” In
opposition to this notion, the writer contends that “centralization has
no tendency whatever to lead a government to excessive interference;”
that the over-meddling of certain centralized governments is not an
effect of their centralization, but of the erroneous opinions which
pervade alike the governments and the people, respecting the legitimate
province of government, and the proper limits of its interference. [P.
237.]

In France, Prussia, and Austria, protection for national industry
against the competition of foreigners is still part and parcel of the
economical creed of the majority: the same may be affirmed of police
regulations determining the prices of provisions, or interfering with
the rates of wages or the hours of labour; nay, the vexatious passport
system, considered as a precaution against crimes, is generally regarded
with favour, and endured with cheerful resignation. In these cases
(produced as examples), and in many analogous cases, the cause of the
over-governing is the false and prevalent opinion; [and as opinion
improves,] the excessive governing has already diminished, and the
disposition to it is rapidly declining.

[Pp. 237-8.]

The writer also shows, that the uncentralized governments which preceded
the present governments of those countries, carried over-governing to a
much greater excess. [Pp. 238-9.] The ignorant and mischievous meddling
of the French Government, before the Revolution, with the freedom of
labour and the processes of industry, was immeasurably worse than
anything which can be justly imputed to the present centralized
government of France.

The reviewer fully examines two other current misconceptions respecting
centralization; that it implies a needless multiplication of public
functionaries, and gives, therefore, large means of corruption or
influence to the head of the administration; and that it is inconsistent
with the existence or with the proper power and influence of popular
local authorities. On the first point, he shows that under a regularly
and systematically constituted administration there would, on the
contrary, be fewer functionaries required than when the organization is
crude and confused, and he points out the real causes which have made
the countries of the Continent of Europe suffer under the evil of an
undue multitude of functionaries. [Pp. 242-9.] With respect to local
authorities, he shows that undue jealousy of their powers, and improper
limitation of their discretion, are in no respect inherent in
centralization; which merely requires that the functions of Edition:
current; Page: [1065] each local authority shall be precisely defined,
and limited to purely local objects. [Pp. 249-56.] When thus defined and
limited, he justly considers not only their existence, but, to a great
degree, their freedom of action, to be important elements of a well
constituted government.

The immediate end of local government, [he observes,] is a good
administration of local affairs: the social education of the country at
large is, or ought to be, its ulterior and paramount object. It appears
to us, that the friends of centralization make a mistake which seriously
damages their cause. In reference to the attributes of local
governments, they look too much to the immediate end of the institution,
and think too little of its remoter and larger purpose. There has been
(for example) in France, till within the last few years, an excessive
disposition to limit the powers of such governments, and to subject them
to the control of the general administration. In respect to the
immediate end, the disposition may be justified or excused; for, owing
to their crude conceptions of local interests, the local governments, if
not so limited and checked, might frequently abuse their powers, to the
detriment of the country and the localities. But by this grudging and
jealous policy, the remoter and larger purpose is nearly or altogether
defeated. It may prevent the authorities of local origin from abusing
their powers. But it also perpetuates their indifference about public
interests, and their ignorance of public affairs; since no man enters
with heart and mind into any business committed to his care if nothing
is left to his discretion, and he is treated with systematic mistrust.
The policy, moreover, thwarts the ends of centralization, by a more
direct and obvious consequence; for, by offending the self-love of the
local authorities and populations, it tends to set them in opposition to
the central authority.

[Pp. 253-4.]

After a careful consideration of the different modes in which the
connection between the local authorities and the general government may
be regulated, he gives a deliberate preference to the plan according to
which

the active government of every locality would be placed in authorities
of local origin; the general administration having a consultative voice.
Specified administrative powers, calculated as well as might be to
prevent the administrators from abusing them, would be given to the
local authorities; these being bound, however, to ask the preliminary
advice of the appropriate department of the general administration in
every matter of importance and difficulty.

[P. 255.]

By this system

the immediate and remote ends of local government would probably be
reconciled to no inconsiderable extent. The obligation of the local
administrators to consult the general administration would be a
considerable (though a merely moral) security against their abusing
their powers. Their habitual exercise of considerable discretionary
powers would give them a political education, and a care for public
interests. By their habitual contact with the chief departments of the
general administration, this important effect of their unshackled
activity would be greatly enhanced. As those departments are constantly
occupied with all the sections of the country, their experience of local
affairs is far more varied than that of the local authorities in any
particular locality; and being accustomed to regard such affairs in
relation to the general interests, they are naturally superior to the
local partialities and prejudices by which such authorities are as
naturally blinded and misled. The results of their varied experience and
dispassionate judgments would be Edition: current; Page: [1066]
constantly offered to the consideration of the local governments; and,
as coming in the shape of advice rather than the form of command, would
find a ready acceptance with the local governments and populations, and
insensibly correct their misconceptions of their special interests.

[Pp. 255-6.]

Citations like those we have made give a most imperfect idea of the
contents and merits of an essay so crowded with matter, and valuable not
only as a contribution to its special subject, but as a model to the
philosophical student. We must for the present be satisfied with having
called attention to a paper which, from its elaborate character, is in
danger of being overlooked by the mere review reader; but we shall have
future opportunities for availing ourselves of some of the important and
forcibly expressed thoughts continually thrown out by the writer on
points incidental to his subject.


361.: THE PROPOSED IRISH POOR LAW [1]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 17 MAR., 1847, P. 5

This is the first of two articles commenting on the “Bill to Make
Further Provision for the Relief of the Destitute Poor in Ireland”; see
also No. 362. Russell’s Bill radically revised the Irish Poor Law by
allowing guardians, at their discretion, to provide out-door relief to
the able-bodied unemployed when the workhouses were full. At the same
time, the “Bill to Facilitate the Improvement of Landed Property in
Ireland by the Owners Thereof, and Thereby to Afford Employment to the
Labouring Classes,” 10 Victoria (8 Feb., 1847), PP, 1847, II, 137-64,
continued the practice of extending loans to landlords. Mill’s unheaded
first leader, which follows the parliamentary report, is described in
his bibliography as “A leading article on the proposed Irish Poor Law,
in the Morning Chronicle of 17th March 1847”

(MacMinn, p. 68).

among the many subjects of contemplation offered to an unprejudiced
observer by any popular frenzy, one of the most worthy of thoughtful
attention is, the theories which it developes. Though mankind in general
do not usually act or feel by theory, they never go on long acting or
feeling without a theory; they must have something to say for
themselves, some weapon with which to face objectors; and though there
needs but little—generally indeed some word or phrase is enough—to
satisfy the utmost exigencies of the multitude in the way of a reason
for the faith which is in them, there are almost always leaders or
advocates who must have something more. All the reason on one side, and
nothing but feeling on the other, never answered yet on any except
religious questions. In politics the post of theorist to a popular
movement is always filled, either better or worse; there are always
people who take upon themselves to find doctrine and argument in
justification of what other people are crying out for.

The present frenzy on the subject of Irish poor-laws has accordingly its
doctrinaires; its men with an idea or two beyond that of merely pointing
with Edition: current; Page: [1067] their fingers to those who have
something, and saying to those who have nothing, “up boys and at them”;
men who aspire to a sort of philosophical theory. And it is important to
consider what this theory is; for however little the actions of most
people are consciously influenced by theories, they may depend upon it
that the goodness or badness of their conduct is in exact proportion to
the goodness or badness of the theory that is requisite for defending
it.

The supporters of permanent out-door relief for Ireland have a theory
which they very complacently oppose to all gloomy predictions respecting
the effect of the measure on the character and habits of the Irish
people. They say that their poor-law must be good not only for the
immediate alleviation, but for the ultimate prevention, of distress,
because it gives to the owners of property an interest in the permanent
well-doing and well-being of the poor. This interest of the rich in
making the poor well off is their staff of reliance for keeping all
things right; and in this they are not single, for theirs is at present
the doctrine of all modish philanthropists, and all political vendors of
new wine in old casks.1 The grand arcanum is supposed to consist in a
great fuss and bustle among the rich to make the poor moral, religious,
and fat; except that the Court ladies and Lord John Manners are for
making sentiment the primum mobile of all this stir, while the poor-law
folks trust rather to the substantial influences of pounds, shillings,
and pence.

This last view of the subject is that with which we are at present
concerned. The well-being, even in a physical sense, of any but the
hereditarily wealthy, cannot be made independent of their own qualities;
if they are indolent and improvident, nothing that can be done for them
by other people will enable them to prosper; nothing can improve their
condition permanently that does not improve their opinions and conduct.
This is so evident that it is admitted even by the poor-law advocates,
ready as they have shown themselves to disown every doctrine of common
sense and experience which stands in the way of their conclusions. Their
theory therefore must be, that any conduct which it is desired to
encourage is best promoted by taking away the motives to it from the
person who is to be induced to practise it, and at the same time laying
a strong motive for making him practise it upon the shoulders of
somebody else. We remember in history no parallel instance of a
practical bull, except that institution of our ancestors which supplied
royal pupils with the needful stimulus to their studies by stripes
vicariously administered on the back of a substitute.

Try the same principle on other things. There have been penal laws now
for a long time, and crimes have not ceased; we are sometimes even told
that they are increasing. Perhaps it is a wrong plan to punish the thief
himself: we now propose every time a theft is proved at the Old Bailey
to let the thief go free, and impose a handsome fine on the sheriff and
magistrates, that they may have an Edition: current; Page: [1068]
interest in preventing thieving. The same plan will apply admirably to
education. Parents or teachers should never allow the child to gain
instruction and moral discipline by being left to feel any of the
consequences of his own negligence or misconduct; much less let them
presume to punish; but require them, on the contrary, to take all
consequences off the child, and on themselves, that they may have the
strongest possible motive to say to the child, “Don’t be naughty;” for
of all power over the child except that of words they would, by the
supposition, have divested themselves. The poor-law people, because the
natural motives to industry and providence have not been sufficient to
produce those virtues in the Irish peasantry, are for supplying the
deficiency, not by strengthening the natural motives, and adding others
to them, but by taking them entirely away, and arming the landlords with
“O fie!” and “Don’t be naughty!” as a substitute. Really this plan of
correcting A’s faults by making B smart for them, depriving B at the
same time of every possible mode of restraining or educating A, is one
of the most curious instances of unreasonable expectation on record.
Pharaoh’s requisitions from the Israelites were nothing to it.2

There was a time when this doctrine was not quite so self-contradictory
as it now is. About twenty years ago there was a rather general move
among political economists and other thinking persons in favour of
poor-laws, on a theory the same, at least in words, as that now
assigned. They said that a poor-law gave the rich an interest in
preventing any such degree of poverty as involved any danger of becoming
chargeable on the parish, and that the English poor-law had long worked
well, because the rich had really felt this interest, and had acted in
consequence. In this we believe there was some truth; but what is it
that was in fact meant? That the rich had exerted themselves to keep
down population, and that it was desirable they should continue to do
so. They did this in various ways: by preventing the building of
cottages; by pulling down those already built; by discouraging marriages
within the parish; by contriving that children should not be born within
it; by throwing obstacles in the way of a labourer’s obtaining a
settlement, and getting their work done as far as possible by labourers
settled elsewhere. These are the things which landlords can do, in
obedience to the pecuniary interest created by poor-rates, and these
things, we sincerely believe, did contribute greatly in England, during
the eighteenth century, to render the poor-law innocuous. Are these the
things which the present clamourers for poor-laws desire to see done? So
far from it, that no landlord can do any of these things without
becoming an object of their unmeasured vituperation. There is nothing
which a landlord can do to keep down the rates, with their good will,
except to “employ the people;” that is, to go on paying the money,
calling it not rates, but wages. The landlords must be made to “find
work;” and pray, when Edition: current; Page: [1069] they have found
work, how are these so-called labourers, whose inveterate dislike to
work we heard so much about even before the relief works had still
further demoralized them—these people, who will now know that they are
to be supported at all events—how are they to be made to do the work
which has been found for them? No means have been found adequate to
produce real work in circumstances at all analogous, except enthusiasm
or the cart-whip. On which of these is our reliance to be placed from
this time forward?

One other question. To how many more than the six or seven hundred
thousand families now thrown or to be thrown upon public support is the
obligation on the owners of property to find work for everybody
considered to extend? We will make the extravagant supposition that
there are the means of employing all this number, and that they may be
employed so as to replace the expense of their maintenance, in improving
the estates of the landlords—what is to be done with the fifteen or
sixteen millions of people to whom, under such ample encouragement, the
rural population of Ireland will assuredly have multiplied, twenty or
twenty-five years hence? Is work to be found for the whole of these also
at other people’s expense?—and for thirty or thirty-two millions in
twenty or twenty-five years more? If not, where is the obligation to
stop, or at what point shall the attempt commence to substitute some
artificial check on the increase of population for the natural checks
which are now going to be removed? But we proceed no further in this
argument, lest we offend the susceptible philanthropists of the present
time, who think they annihilate the laws of physical nature by refusing
to hear of them, and who are really unlucky in having been born into so
refractory a planet as this earth, instead of a world flowing with milk
and water like themselves.


362.: THE PROPOSED IRISH POOR LAW [2]
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 19 MAR., 1847, P. 4

Continuing the criticism of the Irish poor law begun in No. 361, this
unheaded first leader (following the parliamentary report) is described
in Mill’s bibliography as “A leading article on the same subject [as the
preceding one, No. 361], in the Morning Chronicle of 19th March 1847”

(MacMinn, p. 68).

ever since the notable scheme for rendering the Irish people industrious
and provident, by making them pensioners on the landlords, has been
taken off the hands of its authors and launched into legislation by the
Ministry and Parliament of Great Britain, with an almost unanimity of
popular acclamation, we must plead guilty to having so completely
forgotten the state of the question six months ago, that it is a sort of
surprise to us to find our old correspondent Mr. Poulett Scrope, in a
letter in to-day’s Chronicle, still doing duty as champion in Edition:
current; Page: [1070] the cause, and thinking it incumbent on himself to
take up the gauntlet which we threw down, without a single thought of
him, in our paper of Wednesday last.1 We are not inclined to revive any
discussion with Mr. Scrope on a subject on which we have antagonists so
much more powerful, if not in argument, at least in position and
influence, than himself; and his opinion that “the Malthusian theory”
(whatever, for the moment, he may happen to mean by that term) “is
exploded for ever,” and that “Mr. Jenkinson’s cosmogony” was its
prototype, shall remain, so far as we are concerned, uncontroverted.2
Events will have spoken for themselves, in a sufficiently loud voice,
before many years have passed over the heads of the authors of the new
Irish poor-law; to whom their bitterest political enemies could not wish
a severer doom than that of being sentenced to execute the law they are
about to enact.

They have taken upon themselves to do one of two things; either to make
out-door paupers of the whole Irish people, or to announce to them that
they may be and ought to be made out-door paupers, and yet attempt in
detail to avoid making them so. We should have thought that nothing less
than desperation would have induced any men, placed at the head of a
nation, to face the consequences of either side of the alternative. Let
them not flatter themselves that boards of guardians will long stand
between them and the devouring monster that they are raising up. So long
as they go on feeding the people from the Imperial Treasury, the
guardians, we doubt not, will be true to their post. But on the first
attempt to carry the new law really into effect in the parts of Ireland
where the poor are most numerous and the rateable income smallest, there
will not be found a guardian to vote the poor-rate, or a collector to
attempt enforcing it. Government officers must assess, and Government
officers collect it: and as the whole rent of the more poverty-stricken
counties will probably be absorbed without effectually relieving the
people, the comparatively fortunate condition of the north-eastern
counties will not long be seen with equanimity, and a vehement clamour
will be raised for equalizing the burthen by a national rate. If the
Ministers yield to this clamour—and after what they are now doing no
amount of yielding to clamour on their part can be considered
improbable—the onus of working the poor-law throughout all Ireland will
fall directly upon their shoulders. If, on the contrary, they resist, at
least the operations in the more distressed districts will fall upon
them, either by the absorption of the rateable income of those
districts, or by the refusal of the landlords to be the agents of their
own ruin. It is on the officers of Government, therefore, that the
Edition: current; Page: [1071] responsibility will in the end devolve of
exercising the discretion reserved by the proposed law, that of either
giving or refusing out-door relief to a whole people.

We wonder if the authors of this measure have ever attempted to realize
in imagination the details of the task which, when the act shall have
passed, lies to be performed either by them, or, as they would be glad
to believe, by poor-law commissioners and boards of guardians. If, as a
general rule, out-door relief is given, and if the relief is such in
quantity and quality as the law intends, that is, sufficient for
healthful support, those must be blind to all recent experience of Irish
habits and character who suppose that any work whatever will be done, by
the majority of the relieved class, unless from compulsion, and it will
therefore be absolutely necessary to have recourse to a labour test. But
if the persons relieved are required to work, and this not nominally but
really, we wonder whether any one has calculated how many tens of
thousands of armed men it will require to superintend the whole
agricultural population of the south and west of Ireland, and keep them
to their prescribed duty. If, on the other hand, the general rule is to
be not the grant of out-door relief, but the refusal of it, we wonder
whether it has been calculated how many tens of thousands of armed men
will suffice to protect the refusers from the peculiar form which
popular displeasure assumes in Ireland towards those who withhold from
the people what they consider as a right, even when not promised to
them, as out-door relief will now be, by a deliberate enactment of the
Legislature. What escape the Government will find from this dilemma we
in vain attempt to divine: some escape from it they must find. And if
the argument which has now prevailed with Lord John Russell, “What else
have you to propose?”3 is to prevail, then there is no experiment so
opposed to reason and practicability as not to have a chance of being
tried in so really desperate a condition as that of the Irish Government
will then be.

Some persons, whose opinion is entitled to respect, are reconciled to
the intended measure by the persuasion that the unspeakable
embarrassments which it will immediately create will force the
Government to undertake a great national measure of emigration; and Mr.
Scrope, we perceive, indulges the pleasing illusion that the same cause
will induce the landlords to grant peasant properties. These, in fact,
are the only two things which any sane person has proposed as means of
making the intended poor-law a safe measure, and we give Mr. Scrope
credit for as much of sanity as is implied in that idea. But can we give
the same credit to Ministers, and to the majority which supports them?
That very appeal of Lord John Russell, which he thinks so irresistible,
demonstrates the contrary. “What else is proposed?” asks the Minister.
Why, these very things, emigration and peasant properties, are proposed.
And so worthily does the Minister Edition: current; Page: [1072]
appreciate these remedies, so acutely sensible is he of their being
necessary safeguards or necessary consequences of his poor-law, that he
allows it to be affirmed in his presence, without contradiction, that he
means to abandon even the small measure which he promised respecting
peasant properties; while as to emigration, he has from the first
declared that he means to have nothing to do with it.4 If a national
effort were to be made for emigration, the proper time would be now,
when the vast sums which it must cost (in the way of advance at least)
are to be expended at any rate, and when the people are still willing to
go. Wait till out-door relief has become a habit, and try emigration
then if you can.

For the most deplorable feature of the new social system preparing for
Ireland is, that it threatens to put an extinguisher on the real
remedies. If emigration or home colonization would be efficacious with a
poor-law, they would be efficacious without a poor-law; no one can doubt
that if effected on a sufficient scale they would enable every Irish
peasant to live in comfort, on condition of vigorous industry. And let
us remark, by the by, that it is great thoughtlessness (to say no worse)
in Mr. Scrope to assert that we are for keeping down population by
starvation. No one is better aware than Mr. Scrope that with the
measures we recommend no danger of starvation would exist. But adopt
even those measures, together with an out-door poor-law, and it is
impossible any longer to guarantee their efficacy. Make every Irish
family secure of food without work, or even without hard work, and no
one can answer that what you have to offer to them more than food, in
return for unremitting toil beyond the ocean, or as settlers on the
waste, will be a sufficient inducement to them. Some there are who,
being above the poorest in industry and prudence, have raised themselves
somewhat above that level in pecuniary circumstances: these, the élite
of the class, the nucleus of improvement, the hope of the country for
the future, these will emigrate, as they are already doing: the
impending poor-rate will be effectual to extinguish them. But the
indolent and listless, the cottier or conacre-man, whose favourite
pursuit is to “sit by the fire till the praties are done,”5 he will beg
to be excused from emigrating, nor will he even care to undergo the very
considerable labour of reclaiming waste. So long as the poor-rate is
available to him, he will accept of nothing which is only to be obtained
by real work. When the vast number of the paupers shall have consumed,
or their disinclination to work shall have destroyed, the fund from
which the eleemosynary support is drawn, they will throw themselves upon
England; and then, if ever, when the evil returns upon ourselves, we
shall be Edition: current; Page: [1073] forced to begin treating the
Irish people as moral agents, influenced by motives, and who must be
acted on by a system of moral government, and not as creatures whom we
can feed like pigs or turkeys, and prevent as easily from straying out
of the bounds of the stye or poultry yard.


363.: THE GENERAL FAST
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 23 MAR., 1847, P. 4

Queen Victoria had issued a Proclamation setting 24 Mar. as a day of
General Fast (London Gazette, 12 Mar., p. 1025, from which Mill quotes).
Several groups, including the Society of Friends, refused to observe the
day. This first leader (following the parliamentary report) is described
in Mill’s bibliography as “A leading article on the General Fast, in the
Morning Chronicle of 23d March 1847”

(MacMinn, p. 68).

to-morrow has been appointed for what is called a “public fast and
humiliation,” in consideration of “the heavy judgments with which
Almighty God is pleased to visit the iniquities of this land, by a
grievous scarcity and dearth of divers articles of sustenance and
necessaries of life.” The extraordinary document in which this
observance is enjoined—copied, we suppose, from some similar
notification in the reign of Henry VIII or Elizabeth,1 with the omission
only of the strength of expression which in that time was given by
sincerity—not only assumes such familiarity with the Divine councils as
to threaten all “who contemn and neglect the performance of so religious
and necessary a duty” with the “wrath and indignation” of God, but
menaces them, in addition, with temporal punishments which the authors
of the proclamation perfectly well know that they have not the power to
inflict. Perhaps it is well that a manifest untruth should thus stand on
the threshold, as a stumbling-block to those—they must be very few, we
think—who might be in danger of supposing that there was any sincerity
in the remainder of the exhibition. We do not share the opinion, that
those who have ordained the fast will not observe it: this would be
contrary to good taste, and to the spirit of the time, which being a
spirit of minute criticism on all persons who are before the public,
requires a certain consistency in that assumption of being what they are
not, which friends call by the name of decorum, and enemies by that of
hypocrisy. But whoever has any knowledge of the opinions of the educated
classes of the community, is quite aware of the real state of the case.
The authors of the proclamation just as much believe that the potato
failure is a judgment on our national sins, or that fasting will be any
help Edition: current; Page: [1074] towards averting the Divine anger,
as they believe that “punishment may be inflicted on all such as contemn
and neglect the performance” of the farce.

No persons with any pretensions to instruction now see a special
interposition of Providence in a blight, any more than in a thunder
storm. The only difference is that we now know something about the
physical causes of the one, and do not yet know those of the other. That
it has physical causes is just as certain as that thunder, a century
ago, was as much a mystery as the potato disease is now. We do not
imagine that there is one person in the Court or Cabinet, or fifty in
the House of Commons, who in private would affect to believe that the
potato failure is a miracle, or who does not look upon this so-called
religious observance as a piece of empty mummery, and upon the notion of
propitiating Heaven by ascetic practices on the occasion of a public
calamity as belonging to an entirely gone-by order of religious ideas.

If the Government had thought that there was any reason or meaning in
the observance, would they have waited for the prompting of Mr.
Plumptre?2 The portion of the public of whom that gentleman is the
spokesman, is not one whose lead the present or any other Government is
accustomed to follow. The fast is ordered, as so many other things are
done, to avoid a discussion in the House of Commons; and because our
public men shrink from the responsibility of asserting the good sense of
the community against the nonsense of an unimportant section of it, the
same who regard the scarcity as a Divine judgment on the nation for
increasing the grant to Maynooth,3 or some other enormity of that
description, committed by anybody but those on whom the calamity has
fallen.

The line of the Gazette which preceded the Order in Council is a comment
on the bonâ fide character of this national “humiliation.” It announced
that the drawing-room, which was to have been held on the day following
that appointed for the fast, would be held not on that day, but two days
later.4 When people, believing that for their “manifold sins and
provocations” they are under the wrath of an infinitely wise and just
Being, manifested by a “sore punishment,” rush to make confession of
those sins, and with “contrition and penitence of heart” “humble”
themselves before this Being, and implore that, in consideration of
their repentance, He will “withdraw his afflicting hand,” do they, three
days after, go flaunting in the pomps and fopperies of the emptiest form
of human Edition: current; Page: [1075] vanity? Was it thus that people
acted when they believed in the reality of judgments and in the efficacy
of fasts? If there were any sense in the words used by the proclamation,
if it entered into the mind of any person to understand them seriously,
would there not be something actually monstrous in having gala days and
Court receptions until the judgment had been taken off? Could such
things be if men believed what this proclamation asserts? Would not the
theatres be closed, all amusement suspended—would there be any balls or
dinner parties, any marrying or giving in marriage5—would any one set
out on a journey of pleasure, or undertake projects either of recreation
or of worldly advancement, while labouring under this deep sense of
guilt and of Divine wrath, and unknowing as yet whether the prayer and
atonement had been accepted? The agony and distress of Wednesday, with
the levity and frivolity following by pre-arrangement on Saturday, seem
to show the absence of any intention to make the demonstration appear
more than a form. There is the grimace of deep religious feeling, but
there is not the affectation of its actual existence.

The Government probably thought that the nodus was not dignus vindice,6
and that it was better to reserve their strength for more practical
matters. We think this wrong; for there are few things more practically
mischievous than giving the countenance of authority to the religious
notions characteristic of a rude age. It is to such notions, and the
deference paid to them, that we owe the wreck of all good schemes of
Government education, a thing far otherwise important than the obsolete
ceremonies announced for to-morrow’s representation.


364.: EMIGRATION FROM IRELAND
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 7 APR., 1847, P. 4

This article comments on “A Plan of Colonization for Ireland” (23 Mar.,
1847), Spectator, Supplement, 3 Apr., 1847, pp. 1-7, a memorial prepared
by a committee headed by W.H. Gregory, M.P., and M.J. O’Connell, which
bore the signatures of such dignitaries as the Archbishop of Dublin, the
Marquis of Ormonde, and the Earl of Devon. The page references in the
text are to the Spectator. This unheaded first leader is described in
Mill’s bibliography as “A leading article on Emigration from Ireland, in
the Morning Chronicle of 7th April 1847”

(MacMinn, p. 68).

the memorial addressed to Lord John Russell by a body of influential
Irish landlords, on the subject of emigration, is the answer, so far as
they are concerned, to his apparently triumphant but really desperate
interrogation, “What else have you to propose?”1

Edition: current; Page: [1076]
A plan for removing, in the course of three years, two millions of the
population of Ireland, and locating them in the wilds of Canada, would
have been little likely to meet with serious attention a year ago. But
the potato disease in presence, and the poor-law in prospect, constitute
a state of things which demands the remedies termed heroic. When the
first of these calamities is costing England a million monthly, with no
visible termination and no permanent result, while the other is
threatening every Irish ratepayer with literal, not metaphorical ruin,
it is no time to shrink from measures of permanent benefit because they
are large, difficult, and costly. The memorialists accordingly propose
that the interest and redemption of the loan necessary for this gigantic
emigration should be defrayed by extending the English property-tax2 to
Ireland. They have made calculations which satisfy them of the
sufficiency of this resource. [Pp. 5-6.] Thus provided for, the proposed
colonization combines the importance of a great national measure with
the essential characteristics of an operation grounded on the voluntary
principle. It resolves itself into a combination of the tax-paying
classes to effect collectively for Ireland what every landlord, of
ordinary foresight and adequate pecuniary means, is already attempting
on his own estate. Ireland, for the first time in history, offers to
defray the cost of her own regeneration, and asks nothing from England
but the sanction of Government, and the removal of local obstacles.

The plan, of which the outlines are given in the printed memorial, bears
marks of sober and intelligent consideration. The most obvious
difficulties are foreseen, and more or less successfully met. The
colonies cannot possibly absorb, as mere labourers, anything like the
number of emigrants supposed in the project. Accordingly, it is proposed
that the greater part should be located as settlers, not labourers for
hire. The Irish do not adapt themselves easily to a settler’s life,
singly, or in the midst of a population not Irish and Catholic; it is
proposed, therefore, to transplant them, not individually, but as small
village communities, with their priest at the head. [Pp. 2, 5.] The
preparation of the locality, and the superintendence of the location,
require a degree of concert and organization which scarcely any
emigrants, and least of all Irish emigrants, can achieve for themselves,
and which cannot be efficiently or conveniently conducted for them by
salaried officers of Government. To meet these difficulties, it is
proposed that an incorporated company should undertake the whole of
these details, receiving from Government a fixed sum, suppose five
pounds, for each emigrant; employing the emigrants in the first instance
as hired labourers, to make the roads and execute the other works
requisite for their own location; becoming itself the proprietor (by
purchase) of large tracts of land, and deriving its profits from the
value given to this land by the public works executed and the population
Edition: current; Page: [1077] created in the district. [P. 6.] The
practicability, and in many respects eligibility, of colonization thus
conducted, are upheld by the memorialists with considerable success, and
their plan recommends itself at once by just conceptions of the nature
of colonization, and by an unusual degree of adaptation to the Irish
national character.

It would be easy to raise difficulties and find objections, even
formidable ones, to this project; and it is sufficiently known that our
remedy is a different one. We do not think the Irish a good stock to
colonize with, and we see neither justice nor expediency in sending
people to be settlers in Canada who could be made settlers at home. But
the desperate condition of Ireland requires all remedies. The land and
labour market must be cleared at once of a much larger number of
starving competitors than we have any hope of seeing located upon the
waste lands of Ireland on the proprietary system; and on the cottier
system it is far better abstained from entirely. Besides, the grand
difficulty of all remedial measures, in the condition into which things
have now been thrown—the doubt whether they can be carried into
operation—affects, we lament to say, the question of home still more
profoundly than that of foreign colonization. A poor-law, in which
out-door relief is to be a reality, in addition to its own peculiar
evils, poisons the sources of all improvement. By far the strongest
objection to the plan of the memorialists is the uncertainty whether,
even after the machinery is constructed and the path smoothed, a
population which has been told that it is to be fed and employed at all
costs and through all consequences at home, will consent to go abroad.
But it is still more doubtful whether any person whose industry and
forethought qualify him to become a peasant proprietor, will not think
it a better calculation to be a receiver, than a payer, of such
poor-rates as every one must expect under the new act. It is almost a
fruitless hope which looks to the creation of a superior and independent
class of peasantry, when those who would compose the class are even now
rapidly quitting Ireland, taking their small savings with them. A law
which threatens to leave no creature in the rural districts of Ireland
but the mere landlord and the mere cottier or labourer, is an
infelicitous preparation for a future yeomanry. It seems as if an
immense clearance of the soil of Ireland by emigration, were now a
necessary condition of such a state of poor-law management as is
compatible with the very existence of society in Ireland, not to talk
further of its improvement.

And after all which can be said of Irish inertness and indifference, no
reasonable person can for a moment doubt the eminent benefits of
well-conducted Irish colonization to the colonists themselves. The magic
of property is the same in Canada as in Ireland. The salutary shock to
inveterate bad habits would be even stronger in so complete a change of
outward circumstances. And if there is more labour and hardship to be
undergone, there is also still greater temptation to undergo it. The
emigrant settler and the home colonist would both have subsistence and a
competency placed within their reach; but the first would Edition:
current; Page: [1078] have, in addition to this, the possibility of
wealth. Both alike would be removed from the fatal influence of
cottierism and landlordism, of working solely for another, and
multiplying at another’s expense; both alike could claim as their own
all that their industry could produce and their frugality accumulate;
but this all is a far larger provision, an ampler encouragement to the
industrial virtues in distant regions, where the soil is more fertile,
and a larger portion of it may fall to the share of each colonist in
absolute property. We have full faith in the efficacy of proprietorship,
both in the eastern and in the western hemisphere. Turn cottiers into
proprietors, and you have done for the Irish the best you have it in
your power to do. Turn cottiers into proprietors in Ireland, if
possible, but it is better that they be proprietors in America, than
cottiers, or even Dorsetshire labourers, in Europe.


365.: “SANITARY” V. “SANATORY”
 THE TIMES, 7 APR., 1847, P. 3

This letter to the editor is in response to “H.,” “ ‘Sanatory’ v.
‘Sanitary,’ ” The Times, 6 Apr., 1847, p. 3. (Another response, by
“F.P.,” generally supporting Mill’s view, appears immediately under
his.) Mill was probably unaware that “sanatory” (meaning curative, not
as a synonym for “sanitary”) was used in Bentham’s Deontology (1834)—but
in any case he always maintained that Bowring was the real author of
that work. “Sanitary” had been used, to “H.”’s annoyance, by George
William Frederick Howard (1802-64), Viscount Morpeth, in a speech on the
Public Health Bill, discussed in a leader in The Times on 2 Apr. It had
been used, of course, in the title of Chadwick’s “Report on the Sanitary
Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain” (1842), the
first use cited in the Oxford English Dictionary. The letter is Mill’s
second to The Times, his first having been written nearly twenty years
earlier (No. 36). Headed as title, with the subhead, “To the Editor of
The Times,” it is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A letter signed
‘Orthographicus’ in the Times of 7th April 1847 on the spelling of the
word Sanitary”

(MacMinn, p. 68).

sir,—

Your correspondent “H.,” in your paper of Tuesday, must be under a
strange delusion in supposing that “sanatory” is the authorized English
spelling, and that “sanitary” is an improper orthography requiring to be
“vigorously resisted at its very first appearance.” “Sanatory,” as a
substitute for “sanitary,” is a piece of affected slipslop, only
introduced within the last two or three years. All the good English
authorities write, and have always written, “sanitary.”

“Sanatory,” if there be such a word, derived from sano, sanare, must
necessarily mean “curative” or “remedial,” since sanare signifies to
cure. Sanitary laws and sanitary precautions are not intended for cure
but for prevention. A hospital is a “sanatory” establishment; quarantine
is a “sanitary” regulation. “Sanitary” is a word similar to “salutary,”
“voluntary,” “arbitrary,” not derived from the verb sanare, to cure, but
from the substantive sanitas, Edition: current; Page: [1079] health,
like “voluntary” from voluntas, and signifies “regarding” or “relating”
to health. Sanitary measures are measures relating to health.

The Times, to its credit, has usually resisted the corruption of the
English language, and it has now an opportunity of exercising its power
against a very flagrant instance of that corruption.

366.: THE OPENING OF THE PRUSSIAN DIET
 MORNING CHRONICLE, 16 APR., 1847, P. 4

The House of Hohenzollern, Electors of Brandenburg, became Kings of
Prussia in 1701 with Frederick I. The current King, Frederick William IV
(1795-1861), who had in 1840 succeeded Frederick William III, of whom
Mill approved, reluctantly yielded to liberal pressure in calling the
first United Diet or parliament. His speech of 11 Apr. opening the Diet
was printed in the Morning Chronicle on the same day as Mill’s article,
16 Apr., p. 5. This unheaded second leader is described in Mill’s
bibliography as “A leading article on the opening of the Prussian diet,
in the Morning Chronicle of 15th [sic] April 1847”

(MacMinn, p. 68).

the first speech of the King of Prussia at the opening of the first
Prussian Parliament, which we print to-day, is an historical event. Of
all persons interested in the question, the King himself is probably the
one who has the least idea of the significance of his own act. To him it
may present the aspect of a mere formality—a tardy and imperfect
accomplishment of promises too long eluded, and which might never, but
for the sharp twinge of a financial embarrassment, have received their
completion. He may cast his eye back on ancestors few in number, but
mighty in deed, and nurse himself in the fond expectation that the house
of Hohenzollern will be as able permanently to control, as they were to
call into existence the united energies of a great people.

Whereas all other nations that we read of have been of slow growth, and
that spirit which we call nationality, or patriotism, the hardest of all
to be breathed into the souls of mankind, the Prussian people stand
prominently out from the canvass as the great exception to the rule. By
how short a period are we separated from the time when the foresight,
judgment, and perseverance of the Great Elector laid deep the foundation
of his future kingdom, and the genius of the still greater Frederick,
who was at once King, Minister, Treasurer, the first general and the
most skilful diplomatist of his day, reared upon this foundation a
fabric which seems destined to withstand the shocks of time.1 To
Frederick William III it was given to prove how solid had been the work
of his predecessors, when not Edition: current; Page: [1080] even a
military occupation of his country could stamp out of the hearts of his
people that they were “Prussians before all.” The mild and religious
spirit of the late King may, however, have gone for something in
preparing the present intellectual and commercial development of a
people who, with scarce a century of existence, have obtained peaceful
possession of the highest and most responsible rights of freemen.

The speech of the King is a most voluminous document, utterly different
from the short and pithy sentences which are the peculiar properties of
Royal speeches in other constitutional countries of Europe. This perhaps
was necessary to the occasion—necessary certainly in the King’s
apprehension of it, as it appears to be his object to indoctrinate his
subjects in what he considers to be correct views of the theory and
practice of constitutional liberty. We find his Majesty congratulating
his subjects upon the solemn nature of the occasion that had called them
together, and then passing to an eulogy upon the paternal anxiety of his
deceased father for his subjects, and an explanation why the
constitution had been so long deferred. From this the King passes to a
review of the situation of the monarchy on the map of Europe, and points
with justifiable pride to the external triumphs which Prussia has won by
her military valour, and to those still higher triumphs in her internal
development which are due to the intellectual qualities of the people.
He next proceeds to point out those objects to which he wishes them
peculiarly to direct their attention—means of communication, bridges,
roads, &c. It is not, however, from a speech delivered under such
peculiar circumstances that we can expect a full exposition of the
policy of Government, or even such indication of its views as we are
accustomed to look for on similar occasions in older constitutional
countries. The true significance of the event will be found rather in
the fact itself—in the opening of the Diet than in the speech of the
King.

We took a former occasion of commenting upon the terms in which the
Magna Charta of Prussia was promulgated.2 These, however, matter but
little. When a king and a people are brought face to face, a wise spirit
of concession is the policy of the weaker party. Since the events of
1815 restored permanent tranquillity to Europe, the history of Prussia
has been the history of the reluctance of two successive kings to grant
the constitution they had promised to their people; but to the
constitution they have come after all—

-   

    There is a destiny doth shape our ends,
-   

    Rough hew them how we will!3

All who have taken any interest in Prussian politics can remember the
endless pourparlers and discussions between the late King and the
Minister Hardenberg, Edition: current; Page: [1081] to settle the
precise form of the constitutional Utopia best suited to the genius of
the country. No homely serviceable plan would suffice: the necessity was
felt of devising a mystic something which should reconcile the fantastic
requirements of a coy royalty with the rude wants of a people, and the
difficulty of the task became the hackneyed pretext for eluding the
sacred obligations of a pledged word. Squaring the circle is nothing to
devising a scheme of polity in which the despotism of the one and the
freedom of the many shall co-exist. The more the Minister pressed, the
more the King shrunk back. Hardenberg’s plan was, if we remember right,
to be modelled upon that of France. The project which he laid before the
King for a new organization of the communes (Communal-Ordnung);4 the
promise which he drew from him conditionally of instituting the States
of the kingdom; and his design of subjecting all domains to a land-tax,
by which he purposed to render the royal domains contributory to the
revenue of the country, are proofs that Hardenberg at least was sincere
in his intentions. Still, at the very moment of projection, the late
King always interposed with the objection that it was indispensable,
above all, to remove and smooth down everything which might tend to
bring on collisions or misunderstandings, and as this desirable end was
difficult of accomplishment, the promised constitution stood over to a
perpetually receding “next term.” Then Hardenberg died; then Voss died;5
and then, as we are somewhat naïvely told by a German writer, it came
into the King’s mind that he was not worthy to accomplish the sacred
task of giving a constitution to his subjects, and he determined to
bequeath the responsibility to his successor, even as David devolved on
Solomon his son the duty of erecting a temple for the people.6

To carry the history of this change in the form of the Prussian
Government down to our present time—In 1841 the King sent forth a
decree, which, in place of giving a real constitution to Prussia, simply
remodelled the States or Diets upon a somewhat more liberal foundation
than before.7 By the decree of March, 1841, Diets of the provinces were
to be held every two years. A committee was to continue to sit after the
Diet had been dissolved, for the despatch of business, and to form a
channel of communication between the King and the nation. The King
would, upon proper cause appearing, call together the different
committees for the purpose of common deliberation.

Edition: current; Page: [1082]
In this arrangement two things were wanting. First, that a periodical
meeting of all the committees of the provinces should be appointed, in
order to deliberate together; and, secondly, that the control over all
the receipts and expenditure should be vested in the committees. Both of
these requirements are now in some measure satisfied, although so
shackled and hampered with restrictions that, were it not for our full
confidence in the vis medicatrix libertatis, we should almost have
looked upon the constitution, the inauguration of which we this day
record, as nothing better than a jest.


367.: ENLIGHTENED INFIDELITY
 UNPUBLISHED LETTER TO THE REASONER [AFTER 2 JUNE, 1847]

George Jacob Holyoake (1817-1906), secularist, libertarian, promoter of
cooperatives, and social reformer, in 1845 founded and edited the weekly
Herald of Progress, which became, on 3 June, 1846, the Reasoner and
Herald of Progress. It was mainly an outlet for Holyoake’s secular
views, and always had financial problems. In “Propagandism,” Reasoner, 2
June, 1847, pp. 299-301, Holyoake appealed for subscriptions; this
letter in response, clearly intended for publication, but not published,
is undated. The holograph MS in Mill’s hand is in the British Library of
Political and Economic Science, Mill-Taylor Collection, Vol. XLI, No. 4,
on East India Co. paper watermarked 1845. In view of the opinions
expressed in Harriet Taylor’s letter to Mill of 25 July, 1848, one may
infer that this is a joint production (see F.A. Hayek, John Stuart Mill
and Harriet Taylor [London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1951], pp. 124-7).
The draft is headed “To the Editor of the Reasoner.” As the letter was
not published, it is not listed in Mill’s bibliography.

sir,—

Observing that a subscription has been opened in aid of your
publication, I send a small contribution towards it. I should much
regret that the flag of avowed unbelief, unfurled by the Reasoner alone
among English periodical writings, should be lowered for want of the
support necessary to keep it flying. When you commenced writing, some
courage was still required for the public profession and dissemination
of infidel opinions, and although we may now hope that the time for
legal persecution, such as that which you have undergone,1 has passed
away, the willingness to defy, in behalf of what is sincerely believed
to be truth, even the idle talk of the multitude is unhappily
sufficiently rare in all classes, to be entitled not only to honorable
recognition, but to such positive assistance as the case admits of.

It would however be a bad compliment to writers whom I am commending for
speaking out their whole mind to the public, were I to be less free in
expressing Edition: current; Page: [1083] to them, my opinion of their
performances. And I am compelled to say that my good will to the
Reasoner does not arise from my thinking it at all an adequate
representative of either the argumentative or the moral strength of
enlightened infidelity. I give its writers credit for being partly aware
of this, and I trust that they may become fully so, and may succeed in
making the Reasoner a more valuable organ, than I think it has yet been,
of the opinions it professes.

The strongest point of your writers is certainly the metaphysical
argument on the existence of Deity, though even there they offer, I
think, great hold to any dexterous adversary, and might learn, for
example, from Hume’s Dialogues on Natural Religion, far more conclusive
modes of stating their argument.2 But this part of the subject, though
it ought not to be neglected, is neither the best suited for popular
effect, nor in itself the most important. Whether the world has had a
creator, is a matter of hypothesis and conjecture on which, in the
absence of proof, people’s judgment will vary according to the
particular bias of their imagination: but the mischievous superstition
consists in identifying this Creator, with the ideal of abstract
perfection, and making him, as such, an object of adoration and
imitation. Any one who considers the course of nature, without the usual
predetermination to find all excellent, must see that it has been made,
if made at all, by an extremely imperfect being; that it can be
accounted for on no theory of a just ruler, unless that ruler is of
extremely limited power, and hemmed in by obstacles which he is unable
to overcome. Mankind can scarcely chuse to themselves a worse model of
conduct than the author of nature. None but a very bad man ever
manifested in his conduct such disregard not only of the sufferings of
sentient creatures, but of the commonest principles of justice in the
treatment of them, as is manifested by the Creator of the World if we
suppose him to be omnipotent.

It is by treating such topics as these that infidel writers would strike
the most effective blow at superstition while they would, by the same
effort, plant something better in its place. On the subject of revealed
religion there is room for a similar exposure; setting forth the
essential wickedness of the character of the Deity, as Christian writers
have been forced, often against their own better feelings, to conceive
it: the atrocious conception (for example) of a Being who creates on the
one hand thousands of millions of sentient creatures foreknowing that
they will be sinners, and on the other a hell to torture them eternally
for being so. With regard to the question of Evidences, I am sorry to
see that after all the light which has been thrown upon the origin and
history of the Christian and other religions by many authors in the last
and present age, your writers have not got beyond the crude guesses and
fanciful theories which were current a century ago, when historical
criticism, or any real sense of historical truth, had not yet come into
the world.

On the subject of morals, I regret to observe that you do not even aim
at any improvement of the common notions, but give in an apparently
unqualified adhesion to them, exactly as they stand. This is a
retrograde step on the part of infidel writers. Mankind have, as a race,
hitherto grounded their morality mainly on religion, and if their
religion is false it would be very extraordinary that their morality
should be true. For my part I hold that the philosophy of morals is
still in its infancy; that in its practical doctrines there is as much
room for improvement, as in any other department of human thought; and
that even now it is easy to lay down a far better, juster, nobler set of
moral principles and rules than those generally received: the maxims of
the Gospel though admirable in much of their spirit being both vague and
most incomplete, while the attempts to supply their deficiencies by St.
Paul and others amount, in my opinion, to very much worse than nothing.


368.: GROTE’S HISTORY OF GREECE [2]
 SPECTATOR, 5 JUNE, 1847, PP. 543-4

This is the second newspaper notice by Mill of his friend’s History (see
No. 304, where details of Mill’s reviews are given). It is the first
review in the “Spectator’s Library,” where it is headed “Grote’s History
of Greece—Volumes III-IV.” It is described in Mill’s bibliography as “A
notice of the 3d and 4th volumes of Grote’s History of Greece, in the
Spectator of 5th June 1847”

(MacMinn, p. 68).

in the first and second volumes of Mr. Grote’s History, he had not
advanced much beyond the heroic age, or legendary period of Grecian
antiquity: and some readers will be disappointed by finding that even
the present publication brings down the narrative no lower than the
battle of Marathon and the death of Miltiades.1 This slow progress,
however, does not arise from prolixity in the delivery of the matter,
but from the abundance of matter to be delivered. In criticizing
history, every distinct class of readers usually seem to be of opinion
that the author should address himself to them alone, and that they have
a right to complain if he inserts anything which is not required by
their particular tastes. Readers of this sort have found fault with the
former volumes for containing too much of discussion and dissertation;
but we do not anticipate a similar complaint against the present. They
are, indeed, copiously interspersed with reflections: a history would be
of small value if it were not. But the reflections are varied; never
unnecessarily prolonged; and not only grow out of the facts, but form,
in general, an essential part of the exposition of them. Many of the
principal facts Edition: current; Page: [1085] would be neither
interesting nor intelligible without the ideas by which they are
illuminated.

That the progress made in these volumes is not greater chronologically
speaking, arises from the necessity under which the author felt himself,
of bringing together what was known of the early history not only of
Continental Greece, but of the Greek communities in Asia Minor, Italy,
Sicily, and Africa; at all times an important, and in the early times of
Grecian history the most important, portion of the Hellenic people,
being the most wealthy, the most commercial, and the most intellectually
cultivated. It was also needful to give some account of the nations by
whom the Greeks were surrounded, and their contact with whom,
politically and intellectually, so materially influenced their
development. There could be no delineation of the Greek mind without a
picture of the Grecian world; of the several countries and civilizations
known to the Greeks, both as they were, and as the Greeks conceived
them. The Lydians, the Medes, the Persians, even the Scythians and
Cimmerians, are passed successively in review, and the little which can
be ascertained respecting them is carefully distilled from the mixed
mass of materials, by Mr. Grote. And when he comes to nations really
remarkable, respecting whom also there is more to be said—the
Phoenicians, the Assyrians, and the Egyptians—the chapters which he
devotes to them are models of condensed information interestingly and
instructively delivered.

But we are anticipating on the order of the subjects; which it will be
better to enumerate in the succession in which the author presents them.
Having in his former publication treated of the early history of
Peloponnesus and the institutions of Lycurgus, he takes occasion in
opening the present with Corinth, Sicyon, and Megara, to depict the “age
of the Despots,” a period of nearly a century, during which those and
many other Greek commonwealths were ruled by the usurpers called
tyranni. [Vol. III, pp. 1-64; Pt. II, Chap. ix.] After this striking
chapter, the next two are devoted to Athens; the first embracing what is
known of Athenian history and institutions prior to Solon; the second
relating to Solon himself, and the memorable reforms, administrative,
legislative, and constitutional, which have rendered his name immortal.
From this great subject Mr. Grote passes to a survey of the outlying
Grecian states, and of the surrounding nations. This, which forms the
largest division of the present publication, being completed, he returns
to Greece Proper; and, after a rapid sketch of the early literature of
Greece posterior to the Homeric period, and of the initial stage of
Grecian science and philosophy, he enters, early in the fourth volume,
into the period of history in which a continuous narrative becomes
possible. The despotism of the Pisistratidae at Athens;2 the revolution
which Edition: current; Page: [1086] shook them off, and the important
constitutional changes which followed; the absorption of the Asiatic
Greeks into the Persian empire; the tragical history of their revolt and
resubjugation, from the effects of which their freedom and political
greatness never rallied; the important events in Continental Greece
intervening between the expulsion of Hippias and the arrival of the
first Persian armament; and lastly, the heroic repulse of that armament
by the almost unassisted force of one small city-community; these
complete the list of the principal topics of this second portion of the
history. It thus contains the whole process of the formation of the
Athenian constitution, in the first two stages at least, of which the
third and completing stage under Pericles was but the natural
development. It exhibits (and this is no trifle in the dreary moral
waste of most regions of history) two genuinely exalted characters,
Solon and Pittacus;3 and an anticipated glimpse of a third, Aristides.4
It rescues from obscurity another eminent man, of whom we know not
enough to place him by the side of the three preceding, but enough to
show that history has done him scanty justice—Cleisthenes, the real
founder of the Athenian Democracy.5 It narrates the fall of a great
people, the Ionic Greeks, and the beginning of the rise of a far
greater, the Athenians. It brings the great barbarizing power and the
great civilizing power of the world, Persia and Greece, into each
other’s presence; and presents the first scene of that conflict between
the two, on the issue of which depended (as far as such things can ever
be rationally said) the futurity of the human race.

To no part of “this great argument”6 has Mr. Grote proved unequal. These
volumes surpass the promise of their predecessors: as his subject
advances in interest, so does he in the manifestation of the various
powers necessary for dealing with it. His familiarity both with the
great highways and the obscurest bypaths of Grecian literature and
antiquity, has seldom been equalled, and not often approached to, in
unlearned England; while those Germans who have rivalled it have seldom
possessed the quality which eminently characterizes Mr. Grote, of
keeping their historical imagination severely under the restraints of
evidence. Niebuhr and Otfried Müller are skilful in conjecture, but they
often pass off upon themselves and upon us their guesses for facts: Mr.
Grote never does. His deep respect for truth, and the strong tendency of
his intellect towards historical scepticism, enable the reader, who has
seldom the means for sifting the evidences of early history, to place
great reliance on him in the cases (and they Edition: current; Page:
[1087] are neither few nor unimportant) where he has so put together
evidences as to elicit new and unexpected results. His scepticism, too,
being a rational principle and not a prejudice, he now and then shows
good grounds for crediting a statement which previous writers had
distrusted. Thus, the circumnavigation of Africa by the Phoenicians,
more than two thousand years before Vasco da Gama,7 appears to him
perfectly credible, on account of the very circumstances in the story
which made it incredible to the ancients, but which accord with our
present astronomical and geographical knowledge. [Vol. III, pp. 377-85.]
Again, the wonders related by Herodotus respecting the city and
fortifications of Babylon,8 Mr. Grote fully believes, because they are,
as he says, in no respect more extraordinary than what we have still
ocular evidence of in the Egyptian Thebes; while his examination has
given him the fullest confidence in the trustworthiness of Herodotus
when testifying to things which he had himself seen or heard. [Vol. III,
pp. 394n-8n.]

That the scrupulous regard for evidence which distinguishes this
history, arises from no want of historical imagination, is proved by the
author’s remarkable power of realizing and of identifying himself both
with Greek feelings and with the external and internal circumstances of
Greece. This, indeed, is so conspicuous as to constitute the most marked
originality of the book; giving a life to the history which it has never
previously had, and teaching even readers not unfamiliar with the
original authorities, to see many things with Greek eyes for the first
time. Yet the author never so far adopts Hellenic ideas and sentiments
as to lose sight of his own standard. He enters into the feelings and
opinions of the actors, not to supersede but to assist his applications
of the general principles of justice and political experience.

With these qualities, he must indeed be an unskilful writer if his
narrative, when it has once become continuous, could be deficient in
vivacity. In this, as in other respects, Mr. Grote’s powers are adequate
to his subject. As a narrator, he can claim a high rank. In mere
brilliancy and picturesqueness he has often been excelled; but in
history these praises (where the historian is not, like Thucydides, an
eye-witness, or living in the midst of eye-witnesses) are seldom earned
except more or less at the expense of truth. A much greater deficiency
in these qualities would be well supplied by the feeling of life and
reality which never flags, and the moral and imaginative charm thrown
over the narrative by the author’s lively sympathy with greatness, both
that of heroic individuals and of the true hero of the epopee of Greek
history, the most gifted community of human beings which the world has
yet seen, the Athenian People.

Edition: current; Page: [1088]
The superior nobleness and superior gentleness combined, in which Athens
shone preëminent among all states Greek or barbarian, together with that
wonderful development of intellect which has made her the light of the
world from that time to this, Mr. Grote unhesitatingly ascribes to the
superiority of her institutions: first, to her unlimited Democracy;* and
secondly, to the wise precautions, unknown to the other free states of
Greece, by which the sagacity of Solon and of Cleisthenes had guarded
the workings of Athenian institutions against the dangers to which they
were most liable,—precautions which insensibly moulded the mind of the
Demos itself, and made it capable of its heritage of freedom. The
grounds of this conviction are not embodied in a formal dissertation,
but, as the narrative advances, come out with ever-increasing clearness
from the facts of the history. And among the many valuable lessons which
are likely to result to the world from this history when completed, it
is already obvious that one will be the triumphant vindication of the
Athenian Democracy. Agreeing, as we have long done, with the fullest
conviction, grounded on much study and examination, in our author’s
principal conclusions on this most interesting subject, we were not
ourselves fully aware of the whole strength of the case which could be
made out in support of his and our own opinion.

The origins of both terms are obscure. Whig is probably a shortening of
whiggamer or whiggamore, which in the late seventeenth century became
associated with those who supported the Settlement of 1688 and the
Hanoverian succession. Tory is probably from an Irish word for “a
pursued or persecuted person,” hence an “outlaw,” and by extension a
supporter of the Stuarts.

publisher of the Tory Quarterly Review, was headed by John Murray
(1778-1843), assisted in these years by his son, the second John Murray
(1808-92).

Those of Tory views were fond of the cycle of poems, The Christian Year,
2 vols. (Oxford: Parker, 1827), by John Keble, one of the “Oxford
Theologians” (see No. 291), and favoured the Morning Post, the
long-established fashionable conservative paper.

Martin Luther (1483-1546), German father of Protestantism, was
excommunicated from the Catholic Church in 1520 by a Bull of Pope Leo X

Charles James Blomfield had tutored the sons of aristocrats before
becoming Bishop of Chester in 1824, and had shown political and social
skills before his elevation as Bishop of London in 1828. Henry
Phillpotts (1778-1869) was notorious for his reversal of long-standing
anti-Catholic and Tory opinions in supporting Peel on the Catholic
Relief Bill of 1829, after which he became Bishop of Exeter.

Mill presumably has in mind the historical analysis in The Church of the
Fathers (London: Rivington, 1840), and such other of Newman’s works as
The Arians of the Fourth Century (ibid., 1833), Lectures on the
Prophetical Office of the Church (ibid., 1837), and Remarks on Certain
Passages in the Thirty-Nine Articles, No. 90 of Tracts for the Times

I.e., as in a theocratic state, with the head of the church in the royal
palace (St. James’s), and his council in the legislature (St.
Stephen’s).

6
This tightly compressed history of the struggle for dominance between
Church and State runs from the establishment of ecclesiastical authority
by Hildebrand (ca. 1020-85), Pope Gregory VII, who triumphed over the
Emperor Henry IV, through Thomas à Becket (ca. 1118-70), Chancellor of
England and then Archbishop of Canterbury, who quarreled with Henry II
over the church’s authority and was murdered, with a glancing reference
to the Protestant reformers Luther and John Knox (ca. 1513-72), on to
Philippe IV (le Bel) of France (1268-1314), whose envoy, Guillaume de
Nogaret (d. 1303), seized and imprisoned Pope Boniface VIII (ca.
1235-1303) at Anagni in 1303, just before Boniface could excommunicate
Philippe who set up Clement V as the first Pope in Avignon in 1309, and
instigated, with Clement’s compliance, the inquisition against the
Knights Templar in 1310-11.

Mill’s prediction was fulfilled when the Oxford Professorship of Poetry
later in 1842 went to James Garbett (1802-79), who held the chair for
ten years. The defeated Puseyite candidate was Isaac Williams (1802-65),
poet and theologian, author of Tract 80.

8
The account in the Morning Chronicle of 5 Jan. was not “such an old
nurse’s tale” as Mill says, though the Chaplain to the Archbishop of
Canterbury was not involved. A conference was held at Hadleigh, Surrey,
on 25-29 July, 1833, where Hugh James Rose was Vicar, at the instigation
of Rose, Arthur Philip Perceval (a Royal Chaplain), and William Palmer.
Other participants were R.C. Trench (then Rose’s curate) and Hurrell
Froude. The conference was in response to the encroachment on the Church
begun by the repeal in 1828 of the Test and Corporation Acts (9 George
IV, c. 17), continued by the Catholic emancipation of 1829 (10 George
IV, c. 7), and culminating, for the group, in the suppression of the
Irish bishoprics by 3 & 4 William IV, c. 37 (1833).

9
No more letters by Mill on this subject appeared, though the Morning
Chronicle replied to this letter in a leader on 13 Jan., p. 2, and made
further attacks on the Puseyites in second-page leaders on 18 and 29
Jan.

The “Report” arose out of the Fourth and Fifth Annual Reports of the
Poor Law Commissioners (App. A, No. 1, PP, 1838, XXVIII, 210-44, and

It is the practice in Geneva for female servants to delay marriage until
they have saved enough to furnish a house, &c. In illustration of this
state of things it is stated that in 290 out of 956 marriages, the
female was at the time of marriage older than the male. With further
advances in prosperity, it is anticipated that age of marriage would
again diminish. [Chadwick’s note, based on Mallet, pp. 83-4.]

“Out of 100 deaths in the 16th century, 25.92 were children in their
first year; in the 17th century, 23.72; in the 18th century, 20.12; in
1801-13, they were 16.57; and in 1814-33, they were 13.85.” [Mallet, p.
114.] In Liverpool, the number of children which in the year 1840 died
under one year of age was no less than 23 per cent., or what it was in
Geneva in the 17th century. In the county of Wilts, where the
proportionate mortality is 1 in 58, the deaths of children in the first
year were 16 per cent. Dr. Griffin, in a report on the sanitary
condition of the population of Limerick, where the births appear to bear
such proportions to the marriages as they appear to have borne in Geneva
in the earliest periods, namely, of five children to a marriage, and
more in the worst-conditioned districts, makes an important observation
on the subject: “I find that as the poor nurse their own children, there
is in general an interval of about two years between the birth of one
child and that of the next; but if the child dies early on the breast,
this interval will be much shorter; and if this occurs often, there will
be a certain number born as it were for the purpose of dying; and these
being soon replaced, the same number may still be preserved as if there
had been few or no deaths, or only the ordinary number.” Of these 55 per
cent. died. [Chadwick’s note, the concluding reference being to p. 16 of
An Enquiry into the Mortality Occurring among the Poor of the City of
Limerick (n.p., 1840), by Daniel Griffin (ca. 1801-63), physician and
author.]

(1780-1866), British-born geologist, for years resident in the United
States, who is usually cited as author of the Report, and Richard
Zachariah Mudge (1790-1854), a Royal Engineer who worked on the ordnance

To clarify the vague terms of what Mill calls the “absurd” Treaty of
Versailles (1783), a Treaty of Arbitration was signed on 29 Sept., 1827,
designating the King of Holland, William I, as arbitrator of the
disputes over the boundary between the United States and Canada, not
resolved after the Napoleonic Wars (see n7). His decision was delivered
on 10 Jan., 1831. (See “Copy of an Award of the King of the
Netherlands,” PP, 1831-32, XXXII, 241-53.) The boundary disputes,
however, continued until the award agreed to in the 1842
Webster-Ashburton Treaty.

Art. 4 of “A Treaty of Peace and Amity between His Britannic Majesty and

commissioners could not resolve the claims. If Mill has a specific
“injury” in mind, it is probably the U.S. surveyors’ changing their
instructions so as to produce in the years between 1815 and 1819 a map
with fictitious features, which was presented to the Commissioners in
1819.

Australia received his name in recognition of his part in the
colonization.

Originally a firm proponent of the Corn Laws, Peel had modified his
position in 1842 by introducing a sliding scale of the duty on corn,
dependent on its price (5 & 6 Victoria, Sess. 2, c. 14); at that time,
however, he was still a confirmed protectionist. Faced with an estimated
deficit of £2,000,000, he reintroduced, against strong opposition, the
income tax (which had been repealed in 1816), in 5 & 6 Victoria, c. 35
(22 June, 1842); the revenue from this tax, combined with the lowering
of taxes on hundreds of items and commodities, greatly improved the
state of the economy. Eventually, Peel’s position on the Corn Laws began
to ease, and by the end of 1845 he was ready to propose their
suspension. On 27 Jan., 1846, he outlined his proposal for repeal (PD,
3rd ser., Vol. 83, cols. 239-85), which was brought forward as “A Bill
to Amend the Laws Relating to the Importation of Corn,” 9 Victoria (9
Mar., 1846), PP, 1846, I, 423-8, and enacted as 9 & 10 Victoria, c. 22

Queen’s physician, he, when consulted, did not rule out pregnancy, nor
did he give any other cause for her marked girth. Queen Victoria ordered
a medical examination, after which Sir James declared Lady Flora not
pregnant; but an enlarged liver, of which she died four months later,
still went undiagnosed. See “Statement in Vindication of Lady Flora

On 15 June, 1846, Frederick John White (1819-46), a private in the 7th
Regiment of Hussars, had been given 150 lashes in a flogging, presided
over by Lieut.-Col. John James Whyte (1806-89), that was ordered as
punishment for an assault on a sergeant of the same regiment. White died
on July 11. An inquest held at Hounslow on 15, 20, 27 July, and 3 Aug.,
presided over by Dr. Thomas Wakley (1795-1862), the radical medical
reformer, as coroner, reached a verdict that death had been caused by
the flogging. Private Matthewson, who had also been flogged for
disrespect, was one of the witnesses at the inquest on White’s death.
The case attracted considerable attention and protest. On 7 Aug.,
Russell in a speech on flogging in the army revealed that Wellesley, the
Duke of Wellington (who had been re-appointed Commander-in-Chief for
life in 1842) had subsequently limited the number of lashes to fifty,
and had directed that precautions should be taken about the health of
the culprit and attention paid to the physical conditions (PD, 3rd ser.,
Vol. 88, col. 375). Wellesley confirmed his attitude in a speech of 11
Aug. (ibid., cols. 600-2).

Founded in 1840 under the leadership of Daniel O’Connell, the Repeal
Association (soon renamed the Loyal National Repeal Association), whose
goal was to break the union of Ireland with England, advanced in 1843 a
list of complaints and grievances relating to economic rather than
political causes.

2
In October 1843, O’Connell moved again to political agitation through
“monster meetings.” That planned for 8 Oct. at Clontarf was proclaimed
illegal by de Grey, the Lord-Lieutenant, and a week later O’Connell and
others were arrested for seditious conspiracy.

On 12 Oct. an inquiry was begun in Haverhill, Suffolk, before Coroner
Wayman, into the death of a lunatic pauper, John Webb (1770-1846) in the
Risbridge Union. Abraham Slater (b. 1765), himself a pauper, who had
entered the workhouse in 1843 and served as a “nurse,” could not be
prosecuted, as he was not an official of the Union. The case was widely
reported, The Times’ first notice appearing on 14 Oct., p. 8, and a full

Once more Mill uses this phrase from Shakespeare, Henry IV, Part II,
III, i, 29; in The Riverside Shakespeare, p. 902.

6
Howitt discusses education in Chap. xx (pp. 485-501); in fact he gives
high praise to the universal provision of education in Germany, while
denigrating its practical effects as compared to the English informal
education through business and reading (see, e.g., p. 492). Chap. xxi
(pp. 502-11), while it strongly criticizes aspects of German religious
life, does not dwell, as Mill implies, on the ecclesiastical system.
Howitt’s mixed views on German social life and character are mainly
found in Chaps. xv-xvii (pp. 197-244). For the views of Edward Baines
(1800-1890), advocate of public education independent of the State, see
his “Letter VIII, The Continental Systems,” in Letters to the Right Hon.
Lord John Russell (London: Simpkin, Marshall, [1846]), pp. 76-86. Samuel
Laing (1780-1868), radical author and traveller, devotes about half of
his Notes of a Traveller, on the Social and Political State of France,
Prussia, Switzerland, Italy, and Other Parts of Europe (London: Longman,

criticizes.

taxes, les nobles qui remplissaient la cour obtinrent aisément d’être
exemptés, de sorte que le fardeau doublé tomba d’aplomb sur les épaules
des faibles et des pauvres qui furent bien obligés de rendre ou donner
